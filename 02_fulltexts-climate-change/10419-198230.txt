INTRODUCTION

The intensity and complexity of the economic activities under the actual conditions cannot be
approached without taking into account the aspects related to the environment. The traditional
instruments used in order to plan the economic development are not capable of identifying the
effects on the environment. They do not allow the realistic assessment of the economic increase and
of the welfare of a country, because they do not take into account the market external factors, such
as the natural resources value and either the impact on the environment of the pollution determined
by the anthropic activities, mainly by the productive ones. The usage of the traditional instruments
for the assessment of the economic activities, without taking into account the natural limits, does
performance indexes on sustainability, accepted on a wide scale.
In the development of the indexes regarding the micro-level sustainable development, one
must have in view aspects regarding the three piles of the sustainable development (Azqueta and
Sotelsek, 2007):
 Environment: the compatibility between the activity of the company and eco-systems
maintenance. It comprises an analysis of the impact of the companies and their products in terms of
resources consumption, generated waste, emissions, etc.;
 Social: the social consequences of the company for all the partners: employees (working
conditions, wages, non-discrimination, etc.), suppliers, customers (safety and psychological impact
of the products), local communities (pollution, respect of the local culture, etc.) and society,
generally speaking;
 Economy: “classic” financial performances, impact of the exchange value, capacity to
contribute to the economic development of the area, observance of the competition principles
(corruption absence, dominant position, etc.).
Measuring the environmental and social performances of a company involves a lot of
challenges, such as (Barret and Dreveton, 2007):
The environmental and social aspects are complex and often difficult to quantify;
The comparison of the environmental and social impact for the companies of the same area
is difficult, because of the absence of harmonization when the economic activities are different and
diverse and disparate information is aggregate;
The instructions for the measurement and report of the information are often interpretable;
The availability and quality of the data regarding the sustainable development often leave a
lot to be desired.
All the essential information for the users in order to assess the economic, environmental and
social performance of the entity has to be presented so as to reflect the declared limits, spatial
dimensions and the time period. This approach is based on the idea that the global performance of
an entity can be measured according to the contribution to the economic prosperity, environmental
quality and social capital (Maha and Incaltarau, 2011). Briefly, this notion refers to the frame which
allows the measurement and report of the results of an entity, according to the economic, social and
environmental parameters. In a broader meaning, the term refers to all the processes that an entity
performs in order to minimize the unfavourable effects of its activity. This involves a clear
employees, trade partners, public authority, etc.).

1. WHICH IS THE UTILITY OF THE INDEXES REGARDING THE SUSTAINABLE
DEVELOPMENT AND HOW CAN THEY INFLUENCE THE DECISION-MAKING
PROCESS?

In order to find a relevant answer to these questions, several international and national bodies
gathered their efforts, developing indexes/systems of indexes able to measure all the aspects
regarding the sustainable development. Unfortunately, no unitary point of view on the manner of
approaching these problems has been reached so far. However, we must highlight that in recent
years important progresses have been made in approaching the aspects regarding the sustainable
development. Such concerns were identified both at theoretical level by developing a conceptual
frame, but also at applied level by developing certain models enforceable at macro-economic level
(Environmental Vulnerability Index – EVI, Human Development Index - HDI, Environmental
Sustainability Index – ESI, Environmental Performance Index – EPI, Commitment to Development
Index – CDI, Index of Measure of Economic Welfare – IMEW, Index of Sustainable Economic
Welfare – ISEW, Genuine Progress Indicator – GPI, Wellbeing of Nations, Millennium
Development Goals Indicators – MDI, Commission on Sustainable Development Indicators – CSD,
Sustainable Society Index – SSI, etc.) or at micro-level (ISO, DJSI, WBCSD, EMAS, GRI, etc.).
Even if the indicators/indexes developed so far do not succeed to cover all the target objectives it is
necessary, in order to ensure a sustainable development, to use the available instruments and to
identify new methods and techniques.
For a company, the indexes employed do not have to be too many, so as to be easy to use.
Moreover, it is necessary to focus on results’ interpretation. The absence of certain norms imposing
the use of a range of indexes regarding the sustainable development makes difficult the comparison
of the information regarding the sustainable development published by the companies. Most of the
companies at international level chose to enforce the GRI referential. At national level, the
companies do not use to enforce such norms. We make this assertion after the analysis of the
information published on the sites of the important companies.
Then, the main indexes developed at macro-level are reviewed:
World Business Council for Sustainable Development – WBCSD (http://www.wbcsd.org) was
developed in 2000 and it is an eco-efficiency index which combines the economic indexes with the
measuring the progress in economic and environmental terms in different industrial sectors for the
members of the organization. An entity is deemed eco-efficient when it supplies goods and services
at competitive prices, reducing at the same time the negative effects on the environment during its
life cycle.
Dow Jones Sustainability Indexes – DJSI (http://www.sustainability-indexes.com) is
developed by a financial guidance private company from Switzerland which aims at guiding the
investors in order to include the sustainable development in the investment strategies. DJSI
proposes an assessment system of the strategy based on the concepts of opportunity and risks for the
sustainable development. The opportunities reflect the capacity of the entity of exploiting the
market potential of the products and services with regard to the sustainable development. The risks
focus on strategies aiming at reducing and eliminating the costs related to the environment.
Eco-Management and Audit Scheme – EMAS (2003/532/CE) allows the voluntary
participation of an entity to an environment and audit management system. From the moment when
an entity decides to adopt the EMAS system, it must observe the regulation norms for this system. It
ensures a credible and stringent approach of the environment management. EMAS objectives are to
ensure an environmental performance, to comply with the environmental laws, to communicate the
efforts made in the environmental field and the particular effort for the entity activity integration.
International Standard Organization - ISO (http://www.iso.org/iso/home.htm) is a nongovernmental world organization which aims at issuing a series of technical norms. The family of
ISO 14000 standards focus on the environmental performances of an entity, establishes a series of
indexes which can measure the performances regarding the environmental management. These
indexes can also be determined by the entities which do not have an integrated system of
environmental management, being also used in order to communicate the information regarding the
environmental management system.
Global Reporting Initiative – GRI (GRI, 2002) is an international institution which aims at
establishing guidelines for publishing the non-financial information regarding the sustainable
development. It was established at the initiative of the non-governmental organizations and of the
important companies in Boston by the Coalition for a Responsible Economy (CERES) in
partnership with the UNEP. Initiated in 1997, GRI became independent in 2002. In 2006, an update
of the previous frame (published in 2002) under the name of G3 was performed, which presents an
improvement of the previous provisions for an easier use and the establishment of some pertinent,
comparable and easily verifiable indexes. The review process started in 2011, and in 2013 the final
consultations. The review was determined by the fact that the agenda regarding the sustainable
development was amended and the companies face new challenges regarding the report.
GRI adoption is the result of a voluntary undertaking, because no provision obliges its
enforcement (Quairel, 2004). According to the KPMG study in 2011 (KPMG has been carrying out
this study for 18 years, at present 16 sectors of 34 countries are analyzed), 80% of the reports
published by Global 250 entities (77% in 2008) and 69% by N100 publish information according to
GRI (KPMG, 2011). In Romania, only 23% of the companies publish reports regarding the
corporate responsibility (KPMG, 2011). The Romanian companies were subject to the expertise
within the KPMG study only in 2008. One of the most important remarks of the study was that
there is a difference of engagement regarding the report of the corporate responsibilities by the
multinational companies which operate in Romania, which are more active in other countries
(Figure nr. 2.7). The result shows the fact that the Romanian companies are less mature with regard
to publishing non-financial information in a voluntary manner.

At technical level, GRI appears as a management referential. In fact, GRI does not regulate
the behaviour of an entity but, rather it helps to describe the result of the adoption and enforcement
of certain practices, policies and management systems. GRI’s undertaking of normalizing the
content of a report is minimal. It leaves the entity up to set up the report, besides the eventual
pressure of the users, the imitation and the market being the only constrains for the voluntary
publication undertaking.
environmental reports. However, certain companies started trying out the issuance of one annual
report only which includes financial, economic, environmental and social information. GRI
considers that both the financial reports and the ones regarding the sustainable development fulfil
fundamental functions by means of which they complement each other. GRI encourages the
coordination between the two report processes and hopes that in the long run the financial
performance assessment will be influenced in a beneficial manner by the assessment of the
economic, environmental and social performances.

2. TO WHAT EXTENT ARE THE ROMANIAN COMPANIES INTERESTED IN
OFFERING INFORMATION ON THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT?

At national level, the Green Revolution Association in partnership with the Green Area
Association and the Ministry of Environment developed an index which measures the sustainable
development within the companies, Green Business Index – GBI (GBI, 2010). The action was
initiated for the first time in 2010 in order to assess the situation of 2009, and in 2012 the third
report was published. The participation in index determination is based on volunteering. The
companies register on the site of the Green Revolution Association and fill in a questionnaire, based
on which they will be assessed by independent specialists. The final assessment might require also
the supply of certain additional documents and information. In 2010, the questionnaire included
questions structured on 7 topics and the hierarchy was made for all the180 participating companies.
The debates with the participants and the difficulties faced during the quantification of the data
determined the decision of amending the questionnaire and singularizing the questions on two main
groups:

industry-production

companies

and

trade-services

companies

(http://www.gbindex.ro/ro/organizatori.html). Table 1 presents the classification of the questions in
the questionnaire and their number according to topics and sub-topics for 2010 and 2012. For the
determination of the GBI index in the report of 2010, we mention that the 7 topics have different
weights, the highest being related to resources use 21.6%.

18 questions for the industry/production companies and 21 for the services/trade ones

In fact, over the 3 years, the assessment procedure had improved. Therefore, in 2010 the
opening degree of the companies for a responsible behaviour with regard to the environment was
analyzed, in 2011 the index was adjusted on the two sectors, and in 2012 environmental
performance indexes were introduced in all the topics of the questionnaire, and the application
generates the SWOT analysis for each company (GBI, 2012). After the classification carried out the
top companies receive prizes for the two groups of activities and, within these ones, for each topic.
In 2010, most of the participating companies were subsidiaries of the foreign companies, the
situation changed a little in 2012, 60 % of the companies have foreign capital. According to the GBI
report of 2012, 87% of the participating companies drafted a sustainable development strategy, but
certain companies mentioned that they developed no such policy, because the developed activity
does not affect the environment*, and one of them mentioned that an action plan for the
environment represents an absolute novelty (GBI, 2012). The obtained results cannot be
extrapolated at national level, because of the small number of participants (almost 300 of the total
no. of 235,000 companies) and of the territorial distribution (more than 60% are from Bucharest).
However, this initiative must be welcomed and supported in order to make the companies aware of
the long-term beneficial effects of adopting a responsible behaviour towards the environment.
In order to analyze indexes situation at micro-level in Romania, we had in view the
companies ranked at the Stock Exchange of Bucharest in the 1st category. In this respect, we
consulted the websites of the 26 companies, in order to identify information regarding: ISO
14001/EMAS certification, OHSAS 18001, existence of the integrated environment authorization,
statements regarding the environmental and social policies, involvement in volunteering activities,
investments for the environmental protection or social actions, current expenses for the
environmental protection, environmental or sustainable development reports, eco-labels, conflicts,
penalties or fines related to pollution, CSR reports, etc. The absence of the constraints regarding the
issuance of such information determined the partial finding of the information had in view, which
imposed the direct demand of this information, but unfortunately the response rate was very low.
Analyzing the information published on the websites of the companies, we can state that: 30.7%
*

In fact, the indirect effects of the developed activity are omitted and the hidden consumptions are not taken into account. For
instance, the production of a cup of coffee supposes a consumption of 140 litres of water, and of one kilo of beef almost 16,000 litres
of water.
Prefabricate Bucureşti, Transgaz, Socep), 15% have integrated environmental authorizations (Alro,
Antibiotice, Transelectrica for 98.83% of the locations, Concefa), 19% have an OHSAS 18001
certificate (Alro, Antibiotice, Transelectrica, Electromagnetica, Prefabricate Bucureşti), only 7%
provided information related to environmental investments (Alro 20 million dollars and Oltchim
10.3 million lei), 3.8% presents on the website statements regarding the policies of improving the
performances related to the environment, involvement for waste collection. A report on the
sustainable development is available only at Petrom (a part of the OMV group), and the BRD
annual report includes a chapter consecrated to the environmental information (energy consumption
reduction, water consumption reduction, paper acquisition from certified sources, displacements
reduction).
Given the fact that there is little information published on the sustainable development, the
websites of the multinational companies’ subsidiaries were consulted too. They provided several
data, but there were no strict requirements at national level which impose the issuance of these data,
so they chose to publish the sustainable development reports at group level and not for the
Romanian subsidiaries. Therefore, of the 30 subsidiaries had in view, 73% have an ISO 14000
certification (in the report for the year 2011, Danone group stated that 58% of its locations are
certified, 51.6% of the GDF SUEZ group, and 98% for Arcelor Mittal), 50% have an ISO 9000 and
OHSAS 18001 certification (89% of the locations of the Arcelor Mittal group) and only 6.67%
detained information regarding the integrated environmental authorization (Danone and Arcelor
Mittal for the platform of Galaţi). Dacia and Ford present the list of the locations for the collection
of the out of service cars, offers information regarding a responsible driving, which reduces
pollution, CO2 emissions. In fact, Dacia received the eco2 label for the reduced level of CO2.
Information regarding the environmental protection was found in all the 30 companies, and 70%
have in the main menu a box for the sustainable development, CSR or the environmental protection.
Coca Cola and Ursus Breweries have had individual reports for the Romanian subsidiaries since
2012 and the annual report of Rompetrol includes a chapter on the sustainable development.
Analyzing the reports drafted at group level, we noticed that only 20% of them use the GRI norms
(Siemens being the only company which obtained A+; Coca Cola, Arcelor Mittal and GDF SUEZ
have a B+ certification and Danone and Raiffeisen did not mention the certification level). Mol,
Coca Cola, Holcim and Vodafone entered in the DJSI.
The study showed that most of the Romanian companies (except the subsidiaries of the
foreign companies) are concerned of the sustainable development at declarative level. The websites
environmental policy, but do not present the manners of implementing and monitoring it.
These conclusions are also supported by the information published by the National Statistics
Institute, which mentions that in 2010, 1,414 companies implemented environmental management
systems (1,181 in 2008), less than 1% of the total number of companies. The same thing can be said
about the eco-labelling; only 6 products at national level received this certification.
The analysis carried out shows that the environmental indexes are instruments which offer a
good cost-performance ratio, because (Singha et al., 2012):
 They allow the integration and optimal usage of the dispersed and incomplete primary data,
contribute to organization of the existing data and serve as assessment basis (for instance, when the
primary data is not available on an annual basis);
 Are integrated with other data (particularly, with traditional financial information and can be
associated to the social aspects in order to ensure the sustainable development) offering information
mainly to the external users;
 Represent an important basis for the analysis and integrated modelling of the environmental
information, such as the cost-efficiency analysis, modelling of the economic scenarios and
previsions;
 Because of an integrating frame, they allow framing the sectorial policies and indices in a
global economic context;
 Guarantee the comparability of the results, because of the common concepts and methods.
Surely, the advantages offered by the use of indexes regarding the sustainable development
are substantial and have a major impact on adopting decisions. For instance, at UE level, with
regard to the use of the greenhouse gas emissions certificates, over the period 2005-2007, the
distribution of too many certificates was a signal for the modification of the policy, for that it was
reduced in the following period.

CONCLUSIONS

To sum up, the indexes system regarding the sustainable development is in a continuous
change, because of the permanent modifications of the information needs. Moreover, we must
highlight that the implementation of such a system at micro-level offers to the entities several
advantages in the planning, prevision and control of the actions carried out for the environmental
protection. By analyzing the environmental information published by different groups, we noticed
their unitary treatment. Additionally, the absence of norms leads to the presentation of diverse
information which does not allow performing comparisons among entities of the same activity field
or even for the same entity from a financial year to another, because of the modification of the
approach manner and the presentation of the respective information. Unfortunately, because of the
weak approach of the aspects regarding the sustainable development, the Romanian companies lose
their competitiveness as compared to the companies from the UE and from other countries.

At technical level, GRI appears as a management referential. In fact, GRI does not regulate
the behaviour of an entity but, rather it helps to describe the result of the adoption and enforcement
of certain practices, policies and management systems. GRI’s undertaking of normalizing the
content of a report is minimal. It leaves the entity up to set up the report, besides the eventual
pressure of the users, the imitation and the market being the only constrains for the voluntary
publication undertaking.
environmental reports. However, certain companies started trying out the issuance of one annual
report only which includes financial, economic, environmental and social information. GRI
considers that both the financial reports and the ones regarding the sustainable development fulfil
fundamental functions by means of which they complement each other. GRI encourages the
coordination between the two report processes and hopes that in the long run the financial
performance assessment will be influenced in a beneficial manner by the assessment of the
economic, environmental and social performances.

2. TO WHAT EXTENT ARE THE ROMANIAN COMPANIES INTERESTED IN
OFFERING INFORMATION ON THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT?

At national level, the Green Revolution Association in partnership with the Green Area
Association and the Ministry of Environment developed an index which measures the sustainable
development within the companies, Green Business Index – GBI (GBI, 2010). The action was
initiated for the first time in 2010 in order to assess the situation of 2009, and in 2012 the third
report was published. The participation in index determination is based on volunteering. The
companies register on the site of the Green Revolution Association and fill in a questionnaire, based
on which they will be assessed by independent specialists. The final assessment might require also
the supply of certain additional documents and information. In 2010, the questionnaire included
questions structured on 7 topics and the hierarchy was made for all the180 participating companies.
The debates with the participants and the difficulties faced during the quantification of the data
determined the decision of amending the questionnaire and singularizing the questions on two main
groups:

industry-production

companies

and

trade-services

companies

(http://www.gbindex.ro/ro/organizatori.html). Table 1 presents the classification of the questions in
the questionnaire and their number according to topics and sub-topics for 2010 and 2012. For the
determination of the GBI index in the report of 2010, we mention that the 7 topics have different
weights, the highest being related to resources use 21.6%.

18 questions for the industry/production companies and 21 for the services/trade ones

In fact, over the 3 years, the assessment procedure had improved. Therefore, in 2010 the
opening degree of the companies for a responsible behaviour with regard to the environment was
analyzed, in 2011 the index was adjusted on the two sectors, and in 2012 environmental
performance indexes were introduced in all the topics of the questionnaire, and the application
generates the SWOT analysis for each company (GBI, 2012). After the classification carried out the
top companies receive prizes for the two groups of activities and, within these ones, for each topic.
In 2010, most of the participating companies were subsidiaries of the foreign companies, the
situation changed a little in 2012, 60 % of the companies have foreign capital. According to the GBI
report of 2012, 87% of the participating companies drafted a sustainable development strategy, but
certain companies mentioned that they developed no such policy, because the developed activity
does not affect the environment*, and one of them mentioned that an action plan for the
environment represents an absolute novelty (GBI, 2012). The obtained results cannot be
extrapolated at national level, because of the small number of participants (almost 300 of the total
no. of 235,000 companies) and of the territorial distribution (more than 60% are from Bucharest).
However, this initiative must be welcomed and supported in order to make the companies aware of
the long-term beneficial effects of adopting a responsible behaviour towards the environment.
In order to analyze indexes situation at micro-level in Romania, we had in view the
companies ranked at the Stock Exchange of Bucharest in the 1st category. In this respect, we
consulted the websites of the 26 companies, in order to identify information regarding: ISO
14001/EMAS certification, OHSAS 18001, existence of the integrated environment authorization,
statements regarding the environmental and social policies, involvement in volunteering activities,
investments for the environmental protection or social actions, current expenses for the
environmental protection, environmental or sustainable development reports, eco-labels, conflicts,
penalties or fines related to pollution, CSR reports, etc. The absence of the constraints regarding the
issuance of such information determined the partial finding of the information had in view, which
imposed the direct demand of this information, but unfortunately the response rate was very low.
Analyzing the information published on the websites of the companies, we can state that: 30.7%

In fact, the indirect effects of the developed activity are omitted and the hidden consumptions are not taken into account. For
instance, the production of a cup of coffee supposes a consumption of 140 litres of water, and of one kilo of beef almost 16,000 litres
of water.
Prefabricate Bucureşti, Transgaz, Socep), 15% have integrated environmental authorizations (Alro,
Antibiotice, Transelectrica for 98.83% of the locations, Concefa), 19% have an OHSAS 18001
certificate (Alro, Antibiotice, Transelectrica, Electromagnetica, Prefabricate Bucureşti), only 7%
provided information related to environmental investments (Alro 20 million dollars and Oltchim
10.3 million lei), 3.8% presents on the website statements regarding the policies of improving the
performances related to the environment, involvement for waste collection. A report on the
sustainable development is available only at Petrom (a part of the OMV group), and the BRD
annual report includes a chapter consecrated to the environmental information (energy consumption
reduction, water consumption reduction, paper acquisition from certified sources, displacements
reduction).
Given the fact that there is little information published on the sustainable development, the
websites of the multinational companies’ subsidiaries were consulted too. They provided several
data, but there were no strict requirements at national level which impose the issuance of these data,
so they chose to publish the sustainable development reports at group level and not for the
Romanian subsidiaries. Therefore, of the 30 subsidiaries had in view, 73% have an ISO 14000
certification (in the report for the year 2011, Danone group stated that 58% of its locations are
certified, 51.6% of the GDF SUEZ group, and 98% for Arcelor Mittal), 50% have an ISO 9000 and
OHSAS 18001 certification (89% of the locations of the Arcelor Mittal group) and only 6.67%
detained information regarding the integrated environmental authorization (Danone and Arcelor
Mittal for the platform of Galaţi). Dacia and Ford present the list of the locations for the collection
of the out of service cars, offers information regarding a responsible driving, which reduces
pollution, CO2 emissions. In fact, Dacia received the eco2 label for the reduced level of CO2.
Information regarding the environmental protection was found in all the 30 companies, and 70%
have in the main menu a box for the sustainable development, CSR or the environmental protection.
Coca Cola and Ursus Breweries have had individual reports for the Romanian subsidiaries since
2012 and the annual report of Rompetrol includes a chapter on the sustainable development.
Analyzing the reports drafted at group level, we noticed that only 20% of them use the GRI norms
(Siemens being the only company which obtained A+; Coca Cola, Arcelor Mittal and GDF SUEZ
have a B+ certification and Danone and Raiffeisen did not mention the certification level). Mol,
Coca Cola, Holcim and Vodafone entered in the DJSI.
The study showed that most of the Romanian companies (except the subsidiaries of the
foreign companies) are concerned of the sustainable development at declarative level. The websites
environmental policy, but do not present the manners of implementing and monitoring it.
These conclusions are also supported by the information published by the National Statistics
Institute, which mentions that in 2010, 1,414 companies implemented environmental management
systems (1,181 in 2008), less than 1% of the total number of companies. The same thing can be said
about the eco-labelling; only 6 products at national level received this certification.
The analysis carried out shows that the environmental indexes are instruments which offer a
good cost-performance ratio, because (Singha et al., 2012):
 They allow the integration and optimal usage of the dispersed and incomplete primary data,
contribute to organization of the existing data and serve as assessment basis (for instance, when the
primary data is not available on an annual basis);
 Are integrated with other data (particularly, with traditional financial information and can be
associated to the social aspects in order to ensure the sustainable development) offering information
mainly to the external users;
 Represent an important basis for the analysis and integrated modelling of the environmental
information, such as the cost-efficiency analysis, modelling of the economic scenarios and
previsions;
 Because of an integrating frame, they allow framing the sectorial policies and indices in a
global economic context;
 Guarantee the comparability of the results, because of the common concepts and methods.
Surely, the advantages offered by the use of indexes regarding the sustainable development
are substantial and have a major impact on adopting decisions. For instance, at UE level, with
regard to the use of the greenhouse gas emissions certificates, over the period 2005-2007, the
distribution of too many certificates was a signal for the modification of the policy, for that it was
reduced in the following period.

CONCLUSIONS

To sum up, the indexes system regarding the sustainable development is in a continuous
change, because of the permanent modifications of the information needs. Moreover, we must
highlight that the implementation of such a system at micro-level offers to the entities several
advantages in the planning, prevision and control of the actions carried out for the environmental
protection. By analyzing the environmental information published by different groups, we noticed
their unitary treatment. Additionally, the absence of norms leads to the presentation of diverse
information which does not allow performing comparisons among entities of the same activity field
or even for the same entity from a financial year to another, because of the modification of the
approach manner and the presentation of the respective information. Unfortunately, because of the
weak approach of the aspects regarding the sustainable development, the Romanian companies lose
their competitiveness as compared to the companies from the UE and from other countries.

INTRODUCTION

The intensity and complexity of the economic activities under the actual conditions cannot be
approached without taking into account the aspects related to the environment. The traditional
instruments used in order to plan the economic development are not capable of identifying the
effects on the environment. They do not allow the realistic assessment of the economic increase and
of the welfare of a country, because they do not take into account the market external factors, such
as the natural resources value and either the impact on the environment of the pollution determined
by the anthropic activities, mainly by the productive ones. The usage of the traditional instruments
for the assessment of the economic activities, without taking into account the natural limits, does
performance indexes on sustainability, accepted on a wide scale.
In the development of the indexes regarding the micro-level sustainable development, one
must have in view aspects regarding the three piles of the sustainable development (Azqueta and
Sotelsek, 2007):
 Environment: the compatibility between the activity of the company and eco-systems
maintenance. It comprises an analysis of the impact of the companies and their products in terms of
resources consumption, generated waste, emissions, etc.;
 Social: the social consequences of the company for all the partners: employees (working
conditions, wages, non-discrimination, etc.), suppliers, customers (safety and psychological impact
of the products), local communities (pollution, respect of the local culture, etc.) and society,
generally speaking;
 Economy: “classic” financial performances, impact of the exchange value, capacity to
contribute to the economic development of the area, observance of the competition principles
(corruption absence, dominant position, etc.).
Measuring the environmental and social performances of a company involves a lot of
challenges, such as (Barret and Dreveton, 2007):
The environmental and social aspects are complex and often difficult to quantify;
The comparison of the environmental and social impact for the companies of the same area
is difficult, because of the absence of harmonization when the economic activities are different and
diverse and disparate information is aggregate;
The instructions for the measurement and report of the information are often interpretable;
The availability and quality of the data regarding the sustainable development often leave a
lot to be desired.
All the essential information for the users in order to assess the economic, environmental and
social performance of the entity has to be presented so as to reflect the declared limits, spatial
dimensions and the time period. This approach is based on the idea that the global performance of
an entity can be measured according to the contribution to the economic prosperity, environmental
quality and social capital (Maha and Incaltarau, 2011). Briefly, this notion refers to the frame which
allows the measurement and report of the results of an entity, according to the economic, social and
environmental parameters. In a broader meaning, the term refers to all the processes that an entity
performs in order to minimize the unfavourable effects of its activity. This involves a clear
employees, trade partners, public authority, etc.).

1. WHICH IS THE UTILITY OF THE INDEXES REGARDING THE SUSTAINABLE
DEVELOPMENT AND HOW CAN THEY INFLUENCE THE DECISION-MAKING
PROCESS?

In order to find a relevant answer to these questions, several international and national bodies
gathered their efforts, developing indexes/systems of indexes able to measure all the aspects
regarding the sustainable development. Unfortunately, no unitary point of view on the manner of
approaching these problems has been reached so far. However, we must highlight that in recent
years important progresses have been made in approaching the aspects regarding the sustainable
development. Such concerns were identified both at theoretical level by developing a conceptual
frame, but also at applied level by developing certain models enforceable at macro-economic level
(Environmental Vulnerability Index – EVI, Human Development Index - HDI, Environmental
Sustainability Index – ESI, Environmental Performance Index – EPI, Commitment to Development
Index – CDI, Index of Measure of Economic Welfare – IMEW, Index of Sustainable Economic
Welfare – ISEW, Genuine Progress Indicator – GPI, Wellbeing of Nations, Millennium
Development Goals Indicators – MDI, Commission on Sustainable Development Indicators – CSD,
Sustainable Society Index – SSI, etc.) or at micro-level (ISO, DJSI, WBCSD, EMAS, GRI, etc.).
Even if the indicators/indexes developed so far do not succeed to cover all the target objectives it is
necessary, in order to ensure a sustainable development, to use the available instruments and to
identify new methods and techniques.
For a company, the indexes employed do not have to be too many, so as to be easy to use.
Moreover, it is necessary to focus on results’ interpretation. The absence of certain norms imposing
the use of a range of indexes regarding the sustainable development makes difficult the comparison
of the information regarding the sustainable development published by the companies. Most of the
companies at international level chose to enforce the GRI referential. At national level, the
companies do not use to enforce such norms. We make this assertion after the analysis of the
information published on the sites of the important companies.
Then, the main indexes developed at macro-level are reviewed:
World Business Council for Sustainable Development – WBCSD (http://www.wbcsd.org) was
developed in 2000 and it is an eco-efficiency index which combines the economic indexes with the
measuring the progress in economic and environmental terms in different industrial sectors for the
members of the organization. An entity is deemed eco-efficient when it supplies goods and services
at competitive prices, reducing at the same time the negative effects on the environment during its
life cycle.
Dow Jones Sustainability Indexes – DJSI (http://www.sustainability-indexes.com) is
developed by a financial guidance private company from Switzerland which aims at guiding the
investors in order to include the sustainable development in the investment strategies. DJSI
proposes an assessment system of the strategy based on the concepts of opportunity and risks for the
sustainable development. The opportunities reflect the capacity of the entity of exploiting the
market potential of the products and services with regard to the sustainable development. The risks
focus on strategies aiming at reducing and eliminating the costs related to the environment.
Eco-Management and Audit Scheme – EMAS (2003/532/CE) allows the voluntary
participation of an entity to an environment and audit management system. From the moment when
an entity decides to adopt the EMAS system, it must observe the regulation norms for this system. It
ensures a credible and stringent approach of the environment management. EMAS objectives are to
ensure an environmental performance, to comply with the environmental laws, to communicate the
efforts made in the environmental field and the particular effort for the entity activity integration.
International Standard Organization - ISO (http://www.iso.org/iso/home.htm) is a nongovernmental world organization which aims at issuing a series of technical norms. The family of
ISO 14000 standards focus on the environmental performances of an entity, establishes a series of
indexes which can measure the performances regarding the environmental management. These
indexes can also be determined by the entities which do not have an integrated system of
environmental management, being also used in order to communicate the information regarding the
environmental management system.
Global Reporting Initiative – GRI (GRI, 2002) is an international institution which aims at
establishing guidelines for publishing the non-financial information regarding the sustainable
development. It was established at the initiative of the non-governmental organizations and of the
important companies in Boston by the Coalition for a Responsible Economy (CERES) in
partnership with the UNEP. Initiated in 1997, GRI became independent in 2002. In 2006, an update
of the previous frame (published in 2002) under the name of G3 was performed, which presents an
improvement of the previous provisions for an easier use and the establishment of some pertinent,
comparable and easily verifiable indexes. The review process started in 2011, and in 2013 the final
consultations. The review was determined by the fact that the agenda regarding the sustainable
development was amended and the companies face new challenges regarding the report.
GRI adoption is the result of a voluntary undertaking, because no provision obliges its
enforcement (Quairel, 2004). According to the KPMG study in 2011 (KPMG has been carrying out
this study for 18 years, at present 16 sectors of 34 countries are analyzed), 80% of the reports
published by Global 250 entities (77% in 2008) and 69% by N100 publish information according to
GRI (KPMG, 2011). In Romania, only 23% of the companies publish reports regarding the
corporate responsibility (KPMG, 2011). The Romanian companies were subject to the expertise
within the KPMG study only in 2008. One of the most important remarks of the study was that
there is a difference of engagement regarding the report of the corporate responsibilities by the
multinational companies which operate in Romania, which are more active in other countries
(Figure nr. 2.7). The result shows the fact that the Romanian companies are less mature with regard
to publishing non-financial information in a voluntary manner.

OHSAS 18001 certification (89% of the locations of the Arcelor Mittal group) and only 6.67%
detained information regarding the integrated environmental authorization (Danone and Arcelor
Mittal for the platform of Galaţi). Dacia and Ford present the list of the locations for the collection
of the out of service cars, offers information regarding a responsible driving, which reduces
pollution, CO2 emissions. In fact, Dacia received the eco2 label for the reduced level of CO2.
Information regarding the environmental protection was found in all the 30 companies, and 70%
have in the main menu a box for the sustainable development, CSR or the environmental protection.
Coca Cola and Ursus Breweries have had individual reports for the Romanian subsidiaries since
2012 and the annual report of Rompetrol includes a chapter on the sustainable development.
Analyzing the reports drafted at group level, we noticed that only 20% of them use the GRI norms
(Siemens being the only company which obtained A+; Coca Cola, Arcelor Mittal and GDF SUEZ
have a B+ certification and Danone and Raiffeisen did not mention the certification level). Mol,
Coca Cola, Holcim and Vodafone entered in the DJSI.
The study showed that most of the Romanian companies (except the subsidiaries of the
foreign companies) are concerned of the sustainable development at declarative level. The websites
environmental policy, but do not present the manners of implementing and monitoring it.
These conclusions are also supported by the information published by the National Statistics
Institute, which mentions that in 2010, 1,414 companies implemented environmental management
systems (1,181 in 2008), less than 1% of the total number of companies. The same thing can be said
about the eco-labelling; only 6 products at national level received this certification.
The analysis carried out shows that the environmental indexes are instruments which offer a
good cost-performance ratio, because (Singha et al., 2012):
 They allow the integration and optimal usage of the dispersed and incomplete primary data,
contribute to organization of the existing data and serve as assessment basis (for instance, when the
primary data is not available on an annual basis);
 Are integrated with other data (particularly, with traditional financial information and can be
associated to the social aspects in order to ensure the sustainable development) offering information
mainly to the external users;
 Represent an important basis for the analysis and integrated modelling of the environmental
information, such as the cost-efficiency analysis, modelling of the economic scenarios and
previsions;
 Because of an integrating frame, they allow framing the sectorial policies and indices in a
global economic context;
 Guarantee the comparability of the results, because of the common concepts and methods.
Surely, the advantages offered by the use of indexes regarding the sustainable development
are substantial and have a major impact on adopting decisions. For instance, at UE level, with
regard to the use of the greenhouse gas emissions certificates, over the period 2005-2007, the
distribution of too many certificates was a signal for the modification of the policy, for that it was
reduced in the following period.

CONCLUSIONS

To sum up, the indexes system regarding the sustainable development is in a continuous
change, because of the permanent modifications of the information needs. Moreover, we must
highlight that the implementation of such a system at micro-level offers to the entities several
advantages in the planning, prevision and control of the actions carried out for the environmental
protection. By analyzing the environmental information published by different groups, we noticed
their unitary treatment. Additionally, the absence of norms leads to the presentation of diverse
information which does not allow performing comparisons among entities of the same activity field
or even for the same entity from a financial year to another, because of the modification of the
approach manner and the presentation of the respective information. Unfortunately, because of the
weak approach of the aspects regarding the sustainable development, the Romanian companies lose
their competitiveness as compared to the companies from the UE and from other countries.
