1 Introduction
Supply chains with product recovery differ, depending on
the characteristics of the product, the recovery activity
which is used and whether this activity is done by the
original equipment manufacturer or a third party [6]. In
general, supply chains with product recovery can be distinguished into open-loop and closed-loop supply chains
(CLSC). If there is hardly any connection of the forward
and return product ﬂows, the supply chain is open-loop and
the forward and reverse product ﬂows are managed separately. The forward product ﬂow can be described by the
traditional supply chain management theory, and the
reverse product ﬂow is planned independently by reverse
supply chain management [25]. If the forward and return
product ﬂows are related, e.g. customers supply their used
products as production inputs, the supply chain is closedloop. In this case, often an integrated management of both
ﬂows is necessary to achieve an optimized CLSC; for
further details see [8, 9].
In this work, a supply chain is studied which is closed by
component remanufacturing. Remanufacturing is also


called value-added recovery, since it describes a series of
operations which restore the value of a product after usage
[11]. A supply chain with remanufacturing is extended by
the following activities: collecting, cleaning and testing
returned products. Then, remanufacturable products are
disassembled into components, which are remanufactured,
e.g. repaired or refurbished. After testing these components, they are reassembled and sold in secondary markets
as remanufactured items or reintegrated to the original
supply chain and used as as-new items [11], as in the
supply chain studied in this work. High-value products, e.g.
copiers and automobiles, are suitable for component
remanufacturing. A further discussion of product characteristics that enable remanufacturing can be found in [18].
Whether the supply chain is open- or closed-loop, product recovery forces supply chain management (SCM) to
consider a reverse product ﬂow. In addition to the planning,
realization and control of all operations, production,
inventory and distribution quantities and information ﬂows
from the product origin to the point of consumption, all
problems concerning the way back through the supply
chain, i.e. after consumption, have to be considered in a
SCM with product recovery. These decision problems can
be differentiated regarding their planning horizon: some
are made on a yearly basis and determine the framework
for decisions, which are made on a weekly or monthly basis
[26]. Then again, these decisions constrain the operational
decisions, which occur every day [20].
The network design, decisions regarding the product and
material programme, supplier selection, collection strategy,
take-back arrangements and supply chain coordination are
strategic decision problems and belong to long-term planning. Decision problems regarding inventory management
and production planning are tactical and have a mid-term
planning horizon. Operative decision problems, as disassembly planning, material requirement plans, scheduling
and routing in the remanufacturing shop have a short-term
planning horizon [4, 5, 7, 28].
In order to achieve an optimized CLSC the tactical
planning has to be considered by strategic management
[14, 21, 26]. Long-range forecasts of aggregate product
demand are the input for strategic planning [5]. They are
used by the mathematical model developed in this work to
derive a cost-optimally network design, i.e. cost-optimal
facility locations and capacity equipment, with cost-optimal procuring, transportation, production and storage
quantities. The quantities are planned on an aggregate
level; therefore, ﬂuctuations of data are neglected and the
modelling approach is deterministic.
In the facility location problem (FLP), facilities are
located and quantities of goods are allocated and distributed in the network a cost-optimal way, e.g. in [2]. In
the special case of a CLSN with reverse product ﬂows





these models support the procuring decision, i.e. when to
recover returned products and use them as production
inputs, as well, e.g. in [8, 9].
In the literature so far, location/allocation models in a
CLSCN consider opening costs of product recovery facilities, but costs for volume capacity and costs for installing
technology or hiring workforce for the operations at the
respective facilities of the network, especially for product
recovery operations, are neglected. However, to determine
a cost-optimal procurement policy, i.e. to decide when to
recover returned products and use the resulting items as
production inputs instead of new items procured from
suppliers, these costs have to be included.
Since remanufacturing is a labour-intensive operation
(see [13] for an extended discussion), labour hour costs are
relevant for the decision to process returned products. The
well-established aggregate production planning (APP)framework is used to plan the production and workforce at
facilities cost-optimally in this work. In APP, the length of
the planning horizon is usually between 6 and 24 months
[3] and quantities are planned on an aggregate level. In the
following this APP-approach is described and a multi-period facility location problem extended by capacity and
aggregate production planning is developed.
The consideration of different product compositions,
component remanufacturing and component commonality
is possible with this modelling approach, and the inﬂuence
of different return rates can be investigated. Hence, different realistic SC settings can be captured.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: relevant
selected literature regarding network design and aggregate
production planning is presented and discussed in the next
section. Here, the differences between other contributions
and the approach taken in this work are also discussed. The
CLSCN and the production planning problem are presented
in detail in Sect. 3. Afterwards the planning problem is
described mathematically in Sect. 4. In Sect. 5, it is solved
for an example data set and the results are presented.
Furthermore, a sensitivity analysis is performed and
selected results are discussed in Sect. 5, too. Finally, conclusions and possibilities for further research are stated.

2 Literature review
Networks with product recovery are mathematically optimized by extending the classical Warehouse Location
Problem (WLP) to capture reverse product ﬂows. Mostly
these problems are described by Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) and Mixed Integer Linear Programming
(MILP) models. In the following, selected papers are discussed, which present the state of research, and have
recovery is offered in [1].
As one of the ﬁrst, Marin and Pelegrin [19] study a
network with reverse product ﬂows: customers get products
at plants and return them to plants. The objective is to ﬁnd
the optimal plant location and shipping quantities, such that
the costs for opening facilities and for transportation are
minimized. Marin and Pelegrin’s [19] model is an uncapacitated Facility Location Problem (FLP), whereas the
other models discussed in the following are capacitated
FLP.
Following [19], in this work it is assumed that customers
return their products to those facilities from which the
products are distributed. Unlike [19], in the network studied here, these facilities are not plants, but facilities for
distribution and collection of products, called distribution
and collection centres (DCCs). Furthermore, in [19] a
single product type is considered, whereas in this work
multiple product types are studied.
A remanufacturing network with multiple product types
is examined by Jayaraman et al. [15]. Used products are
shipped from collection zones to remanufacturing centres,
where they can be remanufactured or stored. Remanufactured products are distributed, i.e. are used to fulﬁl customer demand, or stored. The shipping quantities between
collection zones, customers and remanufacturing/distribution locations are to be determined optimally; the objective
is cost minimization.
In this work, following [15], it is assumed that returned
products can be stored at remanufacturing centres. As in
[15], the storage capacity at remanufacturing facilities is
assumed to be limited. Additional to storage capacities,
capacities for operations at facilities are planned in this
work, too.
Operative capacity equipment is studied by Schultmann
et al. [24]. The model by [24] allocates the optimal operative
capacity equipment to open facilities of an existing reverse
supply chain. The capacity at facilities is needed for operations, as e.g. inspection and sorting, of multiple product
types. The objective is to minimize costs, caused by capacity
equipment, production and distribution quantities.
Unlike in [24], in this work a closed-loop system is
studied, i.e. in addition to reverse product ﬂows, forward
product ﬂows are considered. Fleischmann et al. [8] and
Fleischmann et al. [9] study such a closed-loop system as a
three echelon network, consisting of warehouses, plants
and test centres, where products are recovered. These
facilities have to be located optimally, and the quantities of
the forward and reverse product ﬂows of the network are to
be determined such that costs for opening, transport and for
unsatisﬁed demand and not-collected returned products are
minimized under capacity limitations for the product ﬂows
between facilities of different network echelons.

Salema et al. [23] extend the model from [9] to study
multiple product types. Furthermore, in [23] the product
ﬂow capacity at facilities is limited by maximum and
minimum capacity bounds for the facilities.
As in [9, 23], the CLSCN studied in this work has three
facility levels. Here, the three facility levels of the CLSCN
are DCCs, plants and suppliers and remanufacturing centres, both delivering components to plants. The production
system of the CLSCN consists of two stages: at the ﬁrst
stage components are delivered from remanufacturing
centres or from suppliers to plants, where they are assembled to products. This way, component remanufacturing,
unlike product remanufacturing as in [9, 15, 19, 23], with
different product and component types and component
commonality in the assembly of different product types can
be modelled.
In contrast to [9, 15, 23], the capacity for storage and
product and component ﬂows at facilities are decision
variables, i.e. have to be determined out of a parameter
range and induce costs. In addition, capacity for the operations at facilities is determined by the model stated in this
work. Hence, the inﬂuence of different capacity types on
the facility location decisions and on the decision to produce, remanufacture, store or distribute is studied.
All studies discussed above have a single time period
planning horizon. Following [15, 21] consider inventory in
a single time period planning facility location problem and
study the trade-off between storing and distributing products. Further discussions of inventory in distribution networks and the interdependence of inventory, transportation
and facility location can be found in [21] and different
approaches to extend facility location problems by inventory management can be found in [26].
In this work, the planning horizon of the CLSCN design
problem is modiﬁed to a multi-period setting, as in [22] and
[30]. Pishvaee and Torabi [22] use a multi-objective
approach to combine cost minimization of the CLSCN with
the minimization of delivery tardiness for the single product case. In this work, the objective is to minimize costs
and the production and capacity planning problem at open
facilities in a network with multiple commodities is considered in a MILP-approach.
In this work, a FLP for a closed-loop supply chain with
component remanufacturing is extended by production
planning on an aggregate level, using the idea of APP, as in
Steinke and Fischer [30]. In APPs, the different products
are aggregated to product types and the capacities are not
product speciﬁc, but are summarized and stated in common
units, e.g. labour hours. APP is used to determine costoptimal manufacturing and storage plans, which match the
limited means in terms of workforce or working stations,
respectively, and production input with forecasted demand
[20]. The planning horizon of an APP can vary; usually it


consists of 6–24 months, [3]. In particular, when adjustments of capacities are allowed in each period, the periods
have to be sufﬁciently long.
Jayaraman [16] studies the production planning problem
of a company, which offers recovered mobile phones for a
secondary market. He states the Remanufacturing APP
(RAPP) model, which minimizes costs by determining the
optimal disassembly, disposal, remanufacturing, procurement and storage quantities under ﬁxed workforce
capacities.
In this work, the approach of [16] is followed to model
the production system. While in [16] the reverse product
ﬂow is managed, here, a closed-loop system is studied, and
the model is extended accordingly, i.e. the remanufactured
components are reintegrated into the original supply chain
instead of being shipped to secondary markets. Moreover,
in contrast to [16], capacities in volume units and labour
hours at facilities are not ﬁxed but can be adjusted over the
planning horizon.
In the RAPP proposed by [16] only one site for
remanufacturing is considered, whereas in this work,
multiple possible facility locations exist. Hence, the APP
for a closed-loop system is integrated into a FLP.
Extending a yearly FLP for a CLSCN with component
recovery by an APP on a monthly basis leads to a model
with extensive solution times. Furthermore, the considered
capacities cannot be adjusted within one month; especially,
decisions regarding the volume capacity are made on a
strategic level. Therefore, also the APP is extended and the
APP is modelled for a strategic, yearly, planning horizon.
With such an extended strategic planning model, decisions regarding the location of facilities and their capacity
equipment for operations and storage can be studied
jointly. Furthermore, different product and component
types are considered and the interdependence of processing, storing and distributing them is examined. Moreover,
by considering capacity costs and operative capacity in
addition to storage capacity, the cost effects of the decisions regarding the returned products, i.e. if they are
remanufactured, stored or disposed, are captured completely unlike in facility location problems without
capacity and production planning.
Following [9, 19, 23, 30], a ﬁxed relation between
demand and returned products is assumed in this work; the
returned product quantity is determined as a fraction of the
sold product quantity. As in [30], the CLSCN is studied
over multiple time periods, and hence, there is a time lag
between the selling and the returning of a product. In [30] it
is assumed that products are returned by customers after
one period of usage. However, products can stay longer
with the customers, i.e. the residence time of a product,
deﬁned as the number of periods a product is used by a
customer, can be longer. Furthermore, products are





returned not only in a speciﬁc period following the buying,
but in all subsequent periods of the planning horizon. In
this work, the model in [30] is extended to capture these
aspects.
Moreover, the FLCAPPR model developed in this work
determines cost-optimal volume capacities and optimal
workforce size at the facilities for every period. In contrast,
in [31] the capacity planning is integrated in a more simpliﬁed way, such that overcapacities can occur: whenever a
facility is opened, its volume capacity and workforce are
set to their respective upper limits and adjusted to the
actual required levels only in the last period. Furthermore,
while in [30] total costs are minimized, here discounting is
considered in the objective function, too.

3 Problem description
In this section the network structure of the CLSCN with
component remanufacturing is introduced and the respective planning problem is described in detail.
The CLSCN consists of nodes, which represent customers and facilities with their operations, and arrows,
which show the ﬂows of multiple commodities through the
network, see Fig. 1. There are ﬁve different types of nodes:
costumers, DCCs, remanufacturing centres, plants and
suppliers. Customers demand different product quantities
in each period, and they return their products to DCCs in a
later period, i.e. it is assumed that a known fraction of
products shipped to customers in one period is returned in a
later period of the planning horizon. The residence time of
products can be different, but there is a given number of
periods the product has to stay with a customer before it is
returned and considered as remanufacturable. The minimum residence time can be interpreted as the minimum
number of periods a product is in full working condition.
Demand quantities are assumed as deterministic and
known; therefore, the returned product quantities are
deterministic and known, too. Demand is lost whenever it
is not met, i.e. it cannot be backlogged.
The CLSCN consists of three facility levels: DCCs,
plants, remanufacturing centres and suppliers. The latter
are summarized to one level since both provide components. Supplier locations are given, whereas the locations
of DCCs, remanufacturing centres and plants have to be
determined. These facilities can be opened in one period
and then remain open or are closed in a later period. It is
assumed that once a facility is closed, it cannot be opened
again.
Capacities at facilities are determined in volume and
labour hours. The volume capacity restricts the volume of
commodity ﬂows passing a facility and, if existent, the

24

Fig. 1 Closed-loop supply chain network

The labour hour capacity limits the available hours of the
workforce needed for remanufacturing and assembly at
remanufacturing centres and plants, and for handling
products at DCCs.
Capacity levels at facilities are determined once a
facility is opened and can be adjusted in a later period, i.e.
they can be expanded or reduced in ﬁxed steps in every
period.
The product and component ﬂows through the network
are described by three different types of arrows, see Fig. 1.
The solid arrows show the forward product ﬂows, which
are shipped from plants to DCCs and further to the customer locations. The dotted arrows describe the component
ﬂows leaving suppliers or remanufacturing centres,
respectively, to plants. The dashed arrows represent the
reverse product ﬂows, i.e. the ﬂows from customers to
DCCs and from DCCs to remanufacturing centres. In this
CLSCN redistribution is possible, i.e. products and components can be shipped between facilities of the same type.
DCCs are bi-directional facilities, because products ﬂow
through DCCs to customers and customers return used
products to DCCs. At DCCs returned products are collected, visually inspected and, afterwards, they are shipped
either to remanufacturing centres or to the disposal unit.
The decomposition of returned products into components and the remanufacturing of those components to an
as-new condition is performed at remanufacturing centres.
It is assumed that components can be remanufactured
repeatedly in the planning horizon, i.e. the limited number
of possible remanufacturing cycles for components is not
reached. However, there is a known and constant fraction
of components that cannot be remanufactured to the quality
standards of as-new components with a reasonable given
effort and therefore has to be disposed. Moreover, at

remanufacturing centres it is possible to store returned
products, instead of remanufacturing them immediately.
At plants, components are assembled to products of
different types. Product types differ regarding their combination of components, i.e. at least one component in the
product composition has to be different in different products. Components can be product type-speciﬁcally or
commonly used among different product types. They are
shipped from suppliers or remanufacturing centres to plants
and can be held on inventory at plants. No ﬁnal products
are stored in the studied network and products are assembled only if an order exists (MTO). Since the planning
horizon is strategic, no lead-times for operations or transport are considered.
For each planning period the demand and return product
quantities are known, while facility locations and capacity
equipment at the facilities, as well as procurement, transportation, production and inventory quantities, have to be
determined with the objective of total cost minimization.
To support these decisions, the planning problem is formulated as a MILP, presented in the next section.

The objective function of the FLCAPPR problem minimizes the discounted total costs of the CLSCN over multiple
time periods. As the model combines multi-period facility
location, capacity and aggregate production planning, the
objective function consists of cost terms for opening, running



and closing facilities, for the volume capacity equipment and
the labour force at open facilities, for processing and storing
goods at facilities, for procuring components at suppliers, for
transporting goods in the network and for disposing returned

The discounted total costs are described by the following objective function (1). For the sake of clarity the
objective function is split up into three different cost
functions. The ﬁrst cost function presents the costs induced
by multi-period facility location, the second function
includes the costs resulting from capacity planning, and the
costs of aggregate production planning are described by the
third function. Below the functions are introduced followed
by the respective explanations.

induces costs; these costs are captured by the terms in line
three. In line four the costs for closing a facility are stated.
The cost terms in the next line are for procuring and
shipping components from suppliers to plants. Costs for
transporting components from remanufacturing centres to
plants are listed in line six.
The transportation costs of the forward product ﬂow, the
ﬂow of products from plants to DCCs and from DCCs to
customers, and the penalty costs for unsatisﬁed demand are
stated in line seven and eight.
The cost terms in line nine and ten are the shipping costs of
the reverse product ﬂow, i.e. the ﬂow of products which are
returned by customers to DCCs and ﬂow further in the network to remanufacturing centres or to the disposal unit. In the
latter case, costs for disposing occur. The disposal costs for
returned products and remanufactured components are listed
in line eleven. The costs for distributing products or components, respectively, on the same facility level are listed in
line 12–15.

Remanufacturing components at remanufacturing centres
and assembling products at plants induces costs, see lines
one and two. Labour hours of the workforce are needed for
performing the respective operations at the facilities. The
respective costs occur in every period and are stated in line
2 and 3.
Holding products and components at remanufacturing
centres and holding components at plants induces costs,
which are captured by the cost terms in lines 4 and 5.
The costs stated in lines 1–5 occur in every period,
and hence, these costs have to summed up over the
planning horizon. At the end of the planning horizon the
remaining items on stock at the facilities are disposed,
and the respective cost terms are stated in the last two
lines.
In the following, the constraints of the problem are
presented, but before that, important variables are
explained.
y
The variables YEt , Yty and Hty are interrelated. If a facility
is opened in one period, then it is running in this period;
y
therefore, both variables YEt and Yty take value 1 and Hty is
zero.
In the next period this facility can be still open, then
y
y
Ytþ1 ¼ 1 and YEtþ1 ¼ 0, because the facility is already
y
opened, and Htþ1 ¼ 0. However, the open facility can be
y
closed in t þ 1, then Htþ1 takes value 1, and
y
y
Ytþ1 ¼ YEtþ1 ¼ 0.
It is assumed that a facility cannot be opened again after
it is closed. The constraints (2)–(6) deﬁne these
interrelations.

the total product demand is assumed as 10 units per 1000
inhabitants, where the number of inhabitants is taken from
[29]. Furthermore, it is assumed that demand occurs in
every period of the planning horizon, since, as in [8], one
planning period equates to one year.
Costumers demand two different product types, P1 and
P2. Demand for P1 and P2 is assumed as equally high, i.e.
500 units of P1 and P2 are required, in every period.
It is possible to open DCCs and remanufacturing centres
at the demand locations. Suppliers and possible plant
locations are to be found only in the ﬁve biggest German
cities. In Fig. 2 the customer locations with their demand in
product units per planning period are given. Furthermore,
the suppliers and all possible locations for DCCs, remanufacturing centres and plants are shown.
In the initial example used in this work, it is assumed
that demand for P1- and P2-products is known for ﬁve
years and remains constant over the planning horizon.
Later on, a sensitivity analysis is presented which includes
a study on the impact of varying the length of the planning
horizon.
The assembly of each product type requires one speciﬁc
component, M1 for P1- and M3 for P2-products, and one
component, M2, which is commonly used for both product
types. For simplicity the disassembly process is assumed to
be the reverse of the assembly process.

5 Numerical analysis
In this section, the previously stated FLCAPPR model is
solved for an example data set. At ﬁrst, the example, its
data and the solution are described, and then, the sensitivity
of the network to changes in the data is studied. The
inﬂuence of the cost parameters on the decision to
remanufacture is explored. Furthermore, the robustness of
the solution with respect to the quantity of returned products and the length of the planning horizon is examined by
varying the return rate and the number of periods in the
planning horizon. Selected interesting results are discussed.
5.1 Initial setting and solution
In the copier industry, CLSCNs as the one described in
Sect. 3 can be found. At copier manufacturer Xerox, for
example, ’’remanufactured parts are put onto the assembly
line for reuse in brand new copiers’’ [17]. Fleischmann et al
[8] study the facility location problem in a CLSCN of a
European copier remanufacturer for a single-period planning horizon.
In this paper a CLSCN for the copier industry in Germany is to be designed. The product demand is assumed to
be bundled in the ﬁfteen biggest German cities. As in [8]



Fig. 2 Possible facility locations and the location of suppliers and
The multi-period modelling framework of the FLCAPPR
model allows to model a temporal shift between the forward and reverse product ﬂows in the network of t À s ¼
mr periods, i.e. a residence time of a product with a customer can be deﬁned. In this work a residence time of one
year is assumed. Moreover, following [8] the return fraction is assumed to be 50%, i.e. in the initial setting in this
work, 50% of products shipped to the customers are
returned at the beginning of the following period. Therefore, for 5 planning periods the return rate is
q1 ¼ q3 ¼ q4 ¼ q5 ¼ q2 ¼ q4 ¼ q5 ¼ q 3

and q2 ¼ q3 ¼ q4 ¼ q5 ¼ 0:5.

kp4
The other relevant parameters of the initial example and
their values can be found in Table 4. The fraction of the
returned products that has to be disposed, i.e. leaving the
network, is 0.6, as stated in [8]. However, in the CLSCN
studied in this work, returned products and components can
be disposed; therefore, here the sum of the fractions of
returned products md and components md c that has to be
disposed is set to 0.6, i.e. md ¼ md c ¼ 0:3. The transportation costs in the network cp , cp , cp , cc , cc and cp

are taken from [8]. It is assumed that the costs for shipping
goods between facilities of the same type are identical; the
distances between the locations are taken from [10].
The cost difference between the procurement costs cc
z
and remanufacturing costs cr is assumed as 10 MU per
component, as described in [8]. Disposal costs cDEnt and
shx ; 8y 2 F [ R; x 2 C [ P are taken from [8] as well.

Following Silver’s [27] recommendations the inventory
holding costs hp ¼ hc ¼ hc ; 8p 2 P; r 2 R; c 2 C; f 2 F are
r
r
f
assumed as 0.25 MU per unit per year.
The opening costs for the facilities, fv , ff and fr ; are
taken from [8]. The costs and revenues for capacity
adjustments are based on these costs and assumed as
fcapCost ¼ fcapRev ¼ 1000 MU. This assumption is disy
y
cussed in the following sensitivity analysis.
The volume capacity can be adjusted in steps of 1000
units. The lower volume capacity limits at facilities are
1000 m3 ; an open facility has to be equipped at least with
one volume capacity step. The capacity upper bound is
chosen such that one open DCC, remanufacturing centre
and plant is sufﬁcient for the total product or component
ﬂow, respectively.
It is assumed that capacity in labour hours can be
increased or decreased, respectively, by multiples of 1610

h. This results from the following calculation: in Germany
contractual labour hours per week often are 35 h. The
holiday entitlement is six weeks per calendar year.
Therefore, the number of labour hours of one worker per
year is ð52 À 6Þ (’’working’’ weeks in a year) Á 35 (hours
per week) ¼ 1610 (hours per year), neglecting public
holidays and downtime due to sickness.
The FLCAPPR problem with the described data setting
can be solved by the optimization software Gurobi 6.5.0 on
a two 3.10 GHz Intel Xeon Processor E5-2687W and 128
GB RAM computer in 197.71 seconds. The total discounted costs are 19,534,389.05 MU.
In the solution, only one DCC and one plant are used;
both are located in Berlin and are open during the total
planning horizon. The open facilities and their capacity
equipments in the planning periods can be found in Fig. 3.
In every planning period products are shipped from the
open DCC in Berlin to the customers to meet their demand.
The products at the DCC originate from the plant in Berlin,
where these product quantities are assembled in every
period using components that are delivered from the supplier in Berlin. In Fig. 4 the product and component ﬂows
in the network are depicted.
The workforce and volume capacity at the open plant is
at the same level for every period, see Fig. 3, because in
every planning period the same amount of products and
components, respectively, are processed at the plant.
Since in the second period customers start to return
products at the DCC in Berlin, the workforce and volume
capacity at the DCC is increased from the ﬁrst to the second
period, see Fig. 3. The customer demand and the amount of
products which are returned by customers remain the same in
the following periods, therefore, the workforce and volume
capacity at the DCC stay at the same level for the remaining
periods of the planning horizon.
Every returned product is collected in the DCC in Berlin
and then disposed. There is no open remanufacturing centre
in the network and no component remanufacturing takes
place in any period.
It is difﬁcult to compare the results of the initial example
with previous studies of FLPs with reverse product ﬂows,
e.g. in [8], since the planning problem is extended in this
work. Hence, additional parameters had to be introduced
and, therefore, the planning problems differ.
However, it is to be noticed that the solution of the
single-period facility location model presented in [8] recommends to open remanufacturing locations and that
recovered products should be used to meet demand, which
is different from the solution of the initial example of the
FLCAPPR problem in this work. Due to the fact that in the
multi-period approach taken here costs for volume capacity

In this section the sensitivity of the network structure to
changes in the data is studied. First, the impact of the cost
parameters on the decision to remanufacture is examined.
Then the effect of the return rate on the network design is
studied. Thereafter, the length of the planning horizon is
varied and the inﬂuence on the network design and especially on the remanufacturing decision is discussed.
Due to rather extensive computing times the following
tests were implemented allowing an optimality gap of up to
0:01%. The exceptional cases are marked.

By extending the FLP to a multi-period planning problem
in which facility locations, capacities and aggregate production are optimized, additional cost parameters are
introduced in the objective function. In this section the
impact of these cost parameters on the decision to remanufacture is studied.
Therefore, in the following fcapCost ; labccr ; ftr and cr ;
r
8r 2 R; t 2 T, i.e. the cost parameters for volume capacity
and labour hours at the remanufacturing centres, for open
remanufacturing centres and for remanufacturing, are varied, and the results are discussed.

Inﬂuence of volume capacity cost parameters
In previous facility location models in networks with product recovery, as i.e. in [8], the capacity level of a facility
is assumed as given and it is not cost-optimally determined.
Without taking into account costs for volume capacity,
over-capacities in the network can occur.

Fig. 4 Product and component ﬂows in the network

and workforce are included which were not considered in
[8] remanufacturing becomes less attractive and according
to the FLCAPPR model, opening a remanufacturing centre
and remanufacturing components is not cost-optimal.

Furthermore, the capacity requirements resulting from
the ﬂow of goods in a network with product recovery,
especially the increased capacity requirements induced by
the returned product ﬂow additional to the requirements of
forward product ﬂows, are not considered as costs in the
decision problem. In the FLCAPPR model building up
volume capacity at a remanufacturing centre leads to costs;
it is weighted with fcapCost ; 8r 2 R, in the objective
r
function.
In the initial example this cost is assumed as 1000 MU.
Since in the solution of the initial example it is cost-optimal to dispose returned products and procure all components from a supplier, now the capacity cost is decreased to
study if it has an impact on the remanufacturing decision.
The solution of the initial example stays optimal until
fcapCost ¼ 400; 8r 2 R. When fcapCost 400 MU, no rear
r
sonable solutions are obtained. Now, it is optimal to open
every remanufacturing centre in periods 2–5, and volume
capacity is built up in one period and removed in the


following period again and again over the planning horizon
to gain the revenues from the volume capacity decrease,
since fcapRev ¼ 1000 [ 400 ¼ fcapCost . No returned prodr
r
ucts are processed at any remanufacturing centre. This
solution is hardly realistic and shows that the parameters
fcapCost and fcapRev have to be carefully determined.
r
r
Decreasing both parameters fcapCost and fcapRev down
r
r
to zero has no inﬂuence on the network, especially it
remains optimal to dispose every returned product instead
of opening remanufacturing centres and processing
returned products.
Inﬂuence of labour hour cost parameter
In previous studies, as in [8], the workforce at facilities
necessary for the respective operations at the facilities is
not considered. However, the decisions to open a remanufacturing centre and to remanufacture components are
interrelated. For remanufacturing, workforce at a remanufacturing centre is needed whose labour hours cost money.
In this work, the workforce at facilities induces costs that
are taken into account in the objective function.
It is assumed that a labour hour at the remanufacturing
centre costs labccr ¼ 15 MU, 8r 2 R. The impact of this
cost parameter on the decision to remanufacture is studied
in the following.
It turns out that for every value of labccr [ 0 the
solution of the initial example remains cost-optimal.
However, setting this parameter to zero has an impact on
the network design. Now, it is cost-optimal to open a
remanufacturing centre in the second period additional to
the DCC and the plant in Berlin; the remanufacturing
centre remains open for the remaining periods. The network and the open location with the respective capacity
equipment are shown in Fig. 5.
The total discounted costs are 19,345,018.28 MU. With
no labour hour cost at the remanufacturing centre, returned
products are shipped to the remanufacturing centre. There
returned products are stored or disassembled, and suitable components are remanufactured and used for product
assembly at the plant. The processed and stored quantities
are mapped in Figs. 6 and 7, respectively. In period 2-4 the
distribution quantities between the DCC and remanufacturing centre are the same, in the last period the reverse
product ﬂow between the DCC and the remanufacturing
centre is lower: less P2-products are transported to the
remanufacturing centre. Since the quantity of products
returned from customers stays the same from the second to
the last period, the quantity of returned P2-products which
are disposed is increased and at the remanufacturing centre
less P2-products are disassembled in period 5. Therefore,
over the total planning period just 24.48% of the components instead of the maximal possible 24.5% of the

components used at the plant for product assembly are
from the remanufacturing centre, the other components are
procured from the supplier in Berlin. (The maximum percentage results from the limited number of returned products, which in turn results from the return rate.)
The workforce at the remanufacturing centre is set at the
highest possible level in the second until the last period, see
Fig. 8, because workforce induces no labour hour costs
(labccr ¼ 0).
The volume capacity at the remanufacturing centre is
determined cost-optimally at 227,000 m3 for the second
until the fourth period. In the last planning period the
capacity is reduced by one step, thus 1000 m3 , to obtain
revenues for capacity reduction. To comply with this
reduced volume capacity the returned product quantity
shipped to the remanufacturing centre is slightly decreased,
as the processed quantities at the remanufacturing centre,
see Fig. 6. Hence, the decisions regarding the volume
capacity level and the processed quantities at the remanufacturing centre and the reverse product ﬂows in the network are interrelated.
The capacity equipments of the plant and the DCC in
Berlin stay at the same levels as in the initial example,
because the product ﬂows between the plant and the DCC
and between the DCC and the customers are not inﬂuenced
by the labour hour costs at the remanufacturing centre.

Inﬂuence of costs for open remanufacturing centres
The FLCAPPR model optimizes the CLSCN over multiple
periods. It is assumed that a facility in this network can be
opened in any period and in the later periods the open
facility can be closed or stay open.
The opening costs are taken from [8] and the cost per
period
for
an
open
remanufacturing
centre,
ftr ; 8r 2 R; t 2 T, are assumed in the initial example as
10,000 MU. In the initial example no remanufacturing
centre is opened. To study if and how this cost inﬂuences
this decision, the cost is decreased until ftr ¼ 0.
At ftr ¼ 0 it is still not cost-optimal to open a remanufacturing centre. Hence, decreasing the cost parameter
ftr ; 8r 2 R; t 2 T has no impact on the decision to open a
remanufacturing centre under this data setting.
Inﬂuence of remanufacturing cost parameter
As in [8], the difference between the remanufacturing and
procurement costs cr ; 8r 2 R and cc ; 8c 2 C; z 2 Z,
z
respectively, is assumed as 10 MU, that is cr ¼ 0; 8r 2 R
and cc ¼ 10 MU; 8c 2 C; z 2 Z. The solutions presented in
z
[8] recommend remanufacturing of copiers unlike the solution of the initial example in this work. In this section it is
studied, if and how the remanufacturing costs in relation to
the procurement costs inﬂuence the remanufacturing
decision.
The FLCAPPR problem is solved with different values
for cr ; 8r 2 R. Since no remanufacturing takes place at
cr ¼ 0; 8r 2 R, just negative values of cr ; 8r 2 R are
studied, i.e. remanufacturing a component is subsidized.
For every 0 [ cr [ À 30 MU; 8r 2 R the solution
remains the same as described in the solution of the initial
example. From cr ¼ À30 MU; 8r 2 R it is cost-optimal to
remanufacture. Hence, a difference of 40 MU between the
remanufacturing and procurement costs is necessary in
order to make remanufactured components preferable to
procured components. Because costs for volume capacity
and workforce are included in the FLCAPPR model, this
difference has to be bigger than in other studies where
these costs are ignored, e.g. in [8]. At cr ¼ À30 MU ; 8r 2
R a remanufacturing centre in Berlin is opened in the
second period and stays open in the remaining periods.
Like in the solution of the initial example a DCC and a
plant in Berlin are open in every planning period. The
network and capacity levels at open facilities are mapped
in Fig. 9. The total discounted costs are 19,346,946.96 MU,
i.e. costs can be slightly decreased.
The capacity level and product ﬂows between the plant
and the DCC and the DCC and the customers remain as in

the solution of the initial example, see Fig. 4. However,
there is a product ﬂow between the DCC and the remanufacturing centre in Berlin, as shown in Fig. 5.
From the second until the last period products collected
at the DCC are shipped to the remanufacturing centre. At
the remanufacturing centre the returned products are stored
and disassembled to components and suitable components
are remanufactured. After remanufacturing, the components are shipped to the plant. The processed and stored
quantities at the remanufacturing centre are mapped in
Figs. 10 and 11, respectively.
Every remanufacturable returned product and component is processed at the remanufacturing centre and then
shipped from the remanufacturing centre to the plant, i.e.
there are no items on inventories at the end of period 5.
In addition to remanufactured components, components
have to be procured from the supplier in Berlin; only
24.5% of the components used in the product assembly are
remanufactured components. Compared to the solution of
the previous section for labccr ¼ 0; 8r 2 R, this fraction is
slightly increased. For cr ¼ À30; 8r 2 R every remanufacturable product is processed at the remanufacturing
centre.
There is an interrelation between the decisions to store
and process products and the capacity equipment at the
remanufacturing centre, as the capacity levels at the

remanufacturing centre are adapted to the requirements of
the processed and stored quantities, see Figs. 10 and 11. By
storing products from the second to the fourth period
instead of processing them immediately at the remanufacturing centre, less workforce is necessary at the
remanufacturing centre in these periods, see Fig. 9. However, due to building up inventory at the remanufacturing
centre from the second until the fourth period, more volume capacity is necessary in the ﬁfth period; in the last
period the capacity has to be increased to comply with the
increased volume requirements. In the last planning period
all items on inventory are processed, therefore, the workforce in the last period is increased, too, see Fig. 9.

18, 266, 247.79 MU and, hence, lower than before, as no
transportation and other costs for returned products occur.
For every return rate from 0 to 1, the decision regarding
the opening and the capacity equipment of the plant
remains the same. Moreover, for every return rate no
remanufacturing centre is opened, every returned product is
disposed and every component used in the product
assembly is procured from the supplier in Berlin.
The total discounted costs of the CLSCN increase with
the return rate, see Fig. 12. This cost increase is induced by
higher capacity and by disposal and opening costs due to an
increased quantity of returned products which are collected
in the DCCs and disposed afterwards.
Due to the assumption that returned products have to be
collected at DCCs, the return rate has an inﬂuence on the
capacity equipment at the DCC and the opening decision
regarding DCCs, as every returned product ﬂows through a
DCC and requires handling times and space, see Fig. 12.
For a return rate between 0.8 and 1 the volume capacity of
one DCC is not sufﬁcient any more; therefore, a DCC in
Dortmund is opened additional to the DCC in Berlin. The
resulting network with the product and component ﬂows is
displayed in Fig. 13.
From the DCC in Dortmund products are shipped to
¨
customers in Dortmund, Duisberg, Dusseldorf, Essen,
Frankfurt am Main and Cologne in every planning period,
and in the ﬁrst period the demand of customers in Stuttgart
is met by products from the DCC in Dortmund. The
remaining customers receive their products from the DCC
in Berlin.
Some reverse product ﬂows are different from the forward product ﬂows. Customers in Bremen and Hannover
return their products to the DCC in Dortmund, although
they get products from the Berlin DCC. The other customers return their products to the DCC which delivered
the product.
The results show that the reverse product ﬂow inﬂuences
the forward product ﬂow and the optimal network

structure, if the quantity of returned products is high, as in
[8]. Therefore, the forward and reverse product ﬂows have
to be planned simultaneously in order to achieve an optimal
network.
Moreover, it turns out that a higher quantity of returned
products increases the total costs, but does not necessarily
result in a network with remanufacturing. There is no
return rate at which it is cost-optimal to open a remanufacturing centre and use remanufactured components in the
product assembly under the initial data setting, in particular
for the assumed cost parameters.
Now, it is examined which results occur when it is costoptimal to open a remanufacturing centre and to remanufacture all suitable components and the return rate is

varied. Therefore, the FLCAPPR model is solved with cr ¼
À30; 8r 2 R and for return rates from 0 to 1, increasing in
steps of 0.1. The respective total discounted costs of the
resulting network and selected decision variable values for
the results can be seen in Fig. 14.
The total discounted costs increase with the return rate,
like in the study with cr ¼ 0; 8r 2 R. However, for cr ¼
À30; 8r 2 R the cost increase for 0:4 qtkps 1 is slightly
smaller, see Fig. 15.
At return rates qtkps \0:4, every returned product is
disposed and the network consists of a DCC and plant in
Berlin, as in the solution of the initial example. Unlike in
the study with cr ¼ 0, with cr ¼ À30 an increase of the
return rate has an impact on the decision to open a
remanufacturing centre and to remanufacture components.
For values of qtkps ¼ 0:4 to qtkps ¼ 1, a remanufacturing
centre in Berlin is opened in the second period which stays
open over the remaining planning periods. For these return
rates, the respective maximal possible amount of components is remanufactured and used in the product assembly
instead of procured components. Because remanufactured
components are cheaper production inputs than procured

components, for these return rates the total cost increase in
the study with cr ¼ À30 is smaller than for the study with
cr ¼ 0 where no remanufacturing takes place, see Fig. 15.
For 0:4 qtkps 0:7, it is cost-optimal to ship returned
products from the DCC in Berlin to the remanufacturing
centre in Berlin. The remanufactured components are used
in the product assembly in the plant in Berlin. The network
for these return rates was shown already in Fig. 5.
As can be seen in Fig. 14, the capacity level at the
remanufacturing centre increases with the return rate, i.e.
with the quantity of returned products. Over the planning
periods the capacity levels at the remanufacturing centre
can change, too. This happens when returned products are
stored and remanufactured in a later period, instead of
being remanufactured immediately.
The capacity levels at the DCC increase with the return
rate, too. At qtkps ¼ f0:8; 0:9; 1g two DCCs, a DCC in
Berlin and Dortmund, have to be opened to have enough
capacity for the returned products, as in the study with
cr ¼ 0. The opening costs for the second DCC cause the
jump in the total costs, see Fig. 15. The location of the
remanufacturing centre and the plant stays at Berlin.
This analysis has shown that opening a remanufacturing
centre and using remanufactured components in the product assembly is cost-optimal under speciﬁc remanufacturing costs and only if the return rate is high enough,

planning periods, too. Hence, the total discounted costs grow
when the planning periods are increased, see Fig. 16.
It is examined if the length of the planning horizon does
not inﬂuence the network design and the production and
stored quantities in the network, if remanufacturing is costoptimal. Therefore, the FLCAPPR model is solved with
cr ¼ À30; 8r 2 R for planning horizons of 2–7 periods.
The total discounted costs and selected interesting decision
variables are mapped in Fig. 17.
Increasing the planning horizon to six and seven periods
results in the same network as in the solution with 5
periods, which was already described above. In this solution, remanufacturing takes place at an open remanufacturing centre in Berlin, see Fig. 5.
Decreasing the planning horizon of 5 periods by just one
period, to 4 periods, changes the network design. Now, it is
cost-optimal to procure every component for the product
assembly from the supplier in Berlin instead of remanufacturing components. The resulting network is as in the
solution of the initial example, where only a DCC and plant
in Berlin are opened and both stay open over the planning
horizon.

assumed as one year, and the length of the planning horizon can be interpreted as the product life-cycle. In the
initial example the CLSCN is planned over 5 periods. In
this section, the impact of the length of the planning
horizon on the network is studied; therefore, the number of
periods is varied.
The total discounted costs, the satisﬁed product demand
and the disposed returned products over a planning horizon
of 2–7 periods are listed in Fig. 16.
It is assumed that demand and return rate remain the
same over the planning horizon. The structure of the
solution of the initial example remains optimal, i.e. the
network stays the same for an increased number of periods
in the planning horizon. Especially, the decision to procure
the components for the product assembly instead of
remanufacturing components stays the same for the different length of the planning horizon under this data
setting.
The capacity costs and the costs for open facilities rise when
the number of periods is increased. Moreover, since products
and components have to be transported, processed and procured, respectively, these costs increase with the number of

Number of planning periods

Hence, the number of periods in the planning horizon
has an impact on the network design and the decision to
remanufacture. A multi-period planning approach in contrast to a single-period approach, as in [8], for a CLSCN is
useful and leads to new and different results. Therefore, the
relevant number of periods has to be determined and the
network has to be analysed over this planning horizon.

6 Conclusions and future research directions
In this work, the strategic CLSCN design is extended by
capacity and production planning on an aggregate level.
The resulting FLCAPPR model determines the cost-optimal network design, the facility locations and capacity
equipment at open facilities, and the cost-optimal procurement, production and distribution quantities in the
CLSCN over a ﬁnite planning horizon consisting of multiple periods. It is solved for an example from the copier
industry with input data based on previously published
research [8]. Furthermore, possible effects of the extended
planning approach on the network design, especially on the
decision to recover returned products, are studied in a
sensitivity analysis. Thereafter, the robustness of the network design and the production and distribution quantities
regarding the return rate, i.e. the quantity of returned
products, is examined. In a further study the inﬂuence of
the planning horizon length is investigated.
Extending a single-period FLP to the FLCAPPR model
leads to new and different results concerning the decision
to remanufacture and the effect of the return rate on the
network. In contrast to a previous study [8], in this setting,
it is cost-optimal to dispose returned products instead of
recovering them and use the resulting components in the
product assembly based on the FLCAPPR model. When
capacity costs, especially labour hour costs at the remanufacturing centre, are included, remanufacturing is costoptimal only if the remanufacturing costs are sufﬁciently
low compared to the procurement costs for new components from suppliers. Hence, production costs, in particular
remanufacturing costs, have a large impact on facility
location and capacity equipment decisions. Furthermore,
the interdependence between the capacity equipment at the
remanufacturing centre and the procuring decision, the
processing and storing quantities at the remanufacturing
centre is determined. Hence, these decisions have to be
optimized jointly, as in the FLCAPPR model.
The decisions regarding facility locations and capacity
equipment are robust for low return rates. From return rates
of 40% remanufacturing takes place, if remanufacturing
costs are sufﬁciently low. Moreover, for high return rates,
rates of 80% and more, the facility location decisions and
the distribution system are changed compared to the results





for lower rates. Therefore, the forward and reverse product
ﬂows in the network have to be planned together.
The multi-period setting of the FLCAPPR model
enables a study of the inﬂuence of the planning horizon on
the decision to remanufacture and provides new information compared to single-period FLPs, as in [8]. Product
recovery is cost-optimal only if remanufacturing costs are
sufﬁciently low compared to procurement costs and the
planning horizon is sufﬁciently long. For the studied data
setting, this means that there has to be product demand for
at least 5 periods, i.e. ﬁve years; only then remanufacturing
can be cost-optimal.
Following the CLSC-Management deﬁnition in [12], a
CLSCN has to be studied over the total product life-cycle
with consideration of varying demand and returned product
quantities and qualities. Hence, in the future the FLCAPPR
problem should be solved with data sets consisting of
varying demand and returned product quantities in order to
study possible product life-cycle effects.
Moreover, when residence times are longer than one
period, the reverse product ﬂow starts later in the planning
horizon. This can affect decisions regarding the facility
locations and capacity equipment and, therefore, the
remanufacturing decision. Hence, different assumptions
regarding the residence times of products should be
examined in the future.
Linear costs and revenues for adjusting capacity are
assumed here, and the effects of economies of scale and
learning effects gained by higher production quantities and
bigger facilities are not considered. Furthermore, the possibilities to increase or decrease labour hours at facilities by
overtime or part-time, respectively, is not modelled. These
aspects require further model extensions, but it has to be
noted that the FLCAPPR model is already large scale with
rather lengthy solving times.
Finally, uncertainties regarding the quantity and quality
of reverse product ﬂows are an issue of CLSCM [11–13].
They are not considered here, because an APP framework
is used. However, other approaches integrating uncertainties might be developed; this is left for future research.
