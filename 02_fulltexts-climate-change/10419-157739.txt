1 Introduction
Since manufacturing ﬁrms increasingly focus on their core
business activities, an efﬁcient supply chain plays a major
role in generating competitive advantages. However, suppliers too often lack the capability to perform adequately.
In response, manufacturers across a wide range of industries are implementing supplier development programmes
to improve supply chain performance [48]. According to
[22, p. 206], supplier development is deﬁned as any effort
by a buying ﬁrm to improve a supplier’s performance and/
or capabilities to meet the manufacturing ﬁrm’s short- and/
or long-term supply needs.
In accordance with the relational view as proposed
by [10], activities of supplier development, in which ﬁrms
convert general-purpose resources such as money, people
skills, or managerial knowledge into relationship-speciﬁc
resources, represent a rent-generating process. However,
relationship-speciﬁc resources are difﬁcult or even impossible to redeploy outside the particular business relationship [54]. Thus, ﬁrms may see resources committed to
supplier development as vulnerable to opportunistic expropriation [51]. Following this line of reasoning, supplier
development activities with high levels of asset speciﬁcity
should be safeguarded against the hazards of partner
opportunism [27]. Here, contracts in terms of formalized,
legally binding agreements that explicitly specify the


obligations of each ﬁrm, are usually viewed as the primary
means of safeguarding, particularly in a dynamically
evolving environment [2, 7]. The drawback of long-term
contracts is, as the degree of uncertainty increases, both
specifying ex ante all possible contingencies and verifying
ex post the performance of the business partner becomes
increasingly difﬁcult [54]. Therefore, ﬁrms might be reluctant to sign long-term contracts, which potentially diminishes the ﬁrms’ propensity to invest in supplier development
activities and thus impedes the manufacturer’s initial strategy to enhance supply chain performance [37].
Given this background, the purpose of our research is to
analyse the impact of dynamically extending a contract to
mitigate possible contractual hazards. In addition, we seek to
answer the following questions: How does the contract
period, i.e., planning horizon, affect ﬁrms’ willingness to
commit relationship-speciﬁc resources to supplier development? Does receding horizon control offer a straightforward
method for dynamically extending the planning horizon,
while simultaneously facilitating value generation within
supplier development? Further, how should receding horizon control be arranged to optimize supply chain proﬁt?
By answering these questions, the contribution of our
paper is threefold. Firstly, we formulate a continuous-time
optimal control problem characterizing the supplier development investment decision. We conduct a detailed study,
showing that the incentives for ﬁrms to participate in supplier
development critically depend on the contract period. Secondly, given the fact that long-term contracts entail certain
risks, e.g., a lack of ﬂexibility, we utilize receding horizon
control and show that the supplier development process can
be enhanced by dynamically extending the contract, see [43]
for the basic idea of prediction-based control. Based on this
result, a one-to-one map is derived linking the contract period to the optimal level of supplier development (collaboration). The insight gained from these considerations allows
to either increase the supply chain efﬁciency or realize the
same level of collaboration while being obliged to a shorter
contract period. Finally, we present a simple strategy slightly
modifying the proposed receding horizon control scheme in
order to avoid pathological behaviour of the supply chain.
This allows to realize the optimal level of collaboration while
avoiding unnecessary transaction costs. The remainder of
this paper is structured as follows. Firstly, the related literature is brieﬂy reviewed in Sect. 2. Then, in Sect. 3 the basic
optimal control problem is described. In the subsequent
Sect. 4, the dependence of the control policy on the contract
period is studied in detail. In Sect. 5, a receding horizon
scheme is proposed and analysed before the effectiveness of
the developed methodology is demonstrated by means of a
numerical case study in Sect. 6 before conclusions are
drawn.





2 Related literature
The topic of supplier development has received considerable attention from researchers in the past two decades.
Previous research has provided good insights into the use
of certain activities [47], the antecedents [22], critical
success factors [27, 49], and the prevalence of supplier
development in practice [24, 41].
Supplier development has been applied in various ﬁelds
of application [44]. Within the automotive industry, Toyota initially began providing on-site assistance to help
suppliers implement the Toyota Production System [39].
Other manufacturers have followed this collaborative
approach to develop suppliers’ performance and/or capabilities, including Boeing, Chrysler, Daimler, Dell, Ford,
General Motors, Honda, Nissan, Siemens, and Volkswagen
[34, 38]. Typically, manufacturing ﬁrms use a variety of
supplier development activities, e.g., providing performance feedback, training suppliers’ personnel, furnishing
temporary on-site support to enhance further interaction,
providing equipment and tools, or even dedicating capital
resources to suppliers [47, 50].
Empirical studies support that supplier development is a
key factor to attenuate inefﬁciencies within the supply
chain and, thus, strategically contributes to strengthen the
manufacturer’s competitiveness [28, 40]. Beneﬁts resulting
from supplier development include, e.g., improvements in
cost efﬁciency, product quality and/or lead time [17, 25].
However, [23] note that ﬁrms’ success in supplier development varies. In particular, relationship-speciﬁc investments lead, in general, to a more satisfactory outcome.
Further, [22] shows that the ﬁrms’ propensity to participate
in supplier development activities is higher if a continuation of the relationship is expected. Here, [49] adds that
supplier development is more effective in mature as
opposed to initial phases of relationship life cycles.
According to [10], appropriate safeguard mechanisms
may inﬂuence both transaction costs and the willingness of
ﬁrms to commit relationship-speciﬁc resources to supplier
development, a condition that could be an important source
of competitive advantage. In the ﬁrst case, ﬁrms achieve an
advantage by incurring lower transaction costs to realize a
given level of supplier development speciﬁcity. In the
second case, ﬁrms create relational rents by attaining a
higher level of asset speciﬁcity [9, 46]. Following this line
of reasoning, the ﬁrms’ ability to align a considerable level
of relationship-speciﬁc investments with an appropriate
safeguard mechanism could enhance efﬁciency and effectiveness of supplier development activities and thereby
should be critical to the success of supplier development.
Scholars usually distinguish between two classes of

14

enforcement of agreements, e.g., legal contracts, whereas
the second relies on self-enforcing agreements, e.g., relational norms, that make long-term gains from the ongoing
relationship exceed potential short-term payoffs from acting opportunistically [8, 45]. Here, it has been suggested
that self-enforcing agreements are a less costly and more
effective means of safeguarding relationship-speciﬁc
investments in comparison with formal contracts [1, 35].
Despite the signiﬁcant methodological and theoretical
contributions of these streams of research, empirical evidence shows that formal contracts are still viewed as the
primary means of safeguarding against the hazards of
partner opportunism, particular in an ambiguous environment [2, 7]. However, contract research is moving away
from a narrow focus on contract structure and its safeguarding function towards a broader focus that also
highlights adaptation and coordination as shown in [42].
In [53] it is even suggested that contracts function as
relationship management tools.
Nevertheless, the application of formal decision-making
models proposed for assisting ﬁrms in contract negotiations
in order to adequately safeguard relationship-speciﬁc
investments has received limited attention in the supplier
development literature [3]. Without understanding the
impact of the contract period on the ﬁrms’ incentives to
commit relationship-speciﬁc resources to supplier development, its return will be negligible, perhaps even leading
to the premature discontinuation of such collaborative costreduction efforts.
The trend to utilize mathematical models in general and
control theory in particular in decision-making within
supply chains is clearly visible [18] and [16]. Here, model
predictive control (MPC), also termed receding (rolling)
horizon control, plays a predominant role due to its ability
to deal with nonlinear constrained multi-input multi-output
systems on the one hand, see, e.g., [6, 14], and its inherent
robustness on the other hand, see [31, 32, 57] for details.
Consequently, MPC is a well-established strategy to deal
with uncertainties in supply chains, see, e.g., [33, 52] and
[19]. In this paper, MPC is ﬁrst used in supplier development to mitigate possible contractual hazards by dynamical
extending the contract, see also our preliminary study [55].

the coefﬁcients a [ 0 and b [ 0 denote the prohibitive
price and the price elasticity of the commodity, respectively. This market condition is comparable with an
oligopolistic or monopolistic market structure, in which a
ﬁrm can increase market demand by lowering the sale
price. Similar approaches to specify the price distribution
curve have been proposed by [4, 20, 27].

3 Model description

J ¼ JM þ JS ¼

We consider a particular supply chain consisting of a single
manufacturer M and a single supplier S, in which M
assembles components from S and sells the ﬁnal product to
the market. We restrict ourselves to the linear price distribution curve pðdÞ ¼ a À bd, which establishes a connection between the production quantity d and the sale
price p, in order to streamline the upcoming analysis. Here,

It is supposed that the manufacturer wants to decrease the
supplier’s unit production costs cS by conducting supplier
development projects to increase the market share if that
increases the overall proﬁt of the supply chain. To this end,
the sustainable effect of supplier development on the

3.1 Basic model
It is supposed that the decision-making process is structured such that M determines the quantity supplied to the
market obeying the paradigm of proﬁt maximization. Note
that we do not distinguish market demand from the production quantity of the manufacturer because the market
price is endogenous to the quantity sold. Moreover, the
supplier produces the components to satisfy the demand d
and thus does not decide on the production quantity.
Because the manufacturer’s goal is proﬁt maximization, the
production quantity d chosen by M is determined by
differentiating
d Á ðpðdÞ À cM À cSC Þ

ð1Þ

with respect to d and setting the resulting expression equal
to zero, i.e.,
!

ð2Þ

pðdÞ À cM À cSC À bd ¼ 0;

which yields the optimum production quantity d H ¼
and the optimal sale price pðdH Þ ¼ aþcM þcSC .
2
Here, cM and cSC denote the manufacturer’s unit production costs and the supply costs per unit charged by S,
respectively. We further assume that the supplier wants to
earn a ﬁxed proﬁt margin r. Thus, the supply costs cSC
consist of the supplier’s ﬁxed proﬁt margin r and the
supplier’s unit production costs cS , i.e., cSC ¼ r þ cS . This
assumption is not completely new: Honda Motor Company, e.g., ﬁrst learns extensively about a suppliers cost
structure and then speciﬁes a target price that combines
both the suppliers unit production cost and a percent
margin [29]. Similar approaches to specify the supply costs
have been proposed by [4, 21, 27]. Summing up, the supply
chain proﬁt is given by

[4, 11, 20, 27, 56].
The costs of supplier development are integrated into the
proposed model by a penalization term cSD uðtÞ, cSD ! 0.

for a given time interval [0, T], which must be maximized
subject to the control constraints 0 uðtÞ x, t 2 ½0; TÞ,
and the system dynamics (3). The contract period T is of
particular interest since investments into the cost structure
of the supply chain require their amortization during the
runtime of the contractual agreement. A summary of the
parameters is given in Table 1.

Because supplier development is most often used as of the end of
the growth stage as opposed to initial stages of a product’s life cycle,
we consider solely the learning that occurs through the cumulative
number of realized supplier development projects without considering
further effects, e.g., total number of units produced [5, 30].

In the following, (9) is called switching condition. Indeed,
since the cost function is (strictly) convex and the system
dynamics are governed by a linear ordinary differential
equation, it can be shown that this condition is necessary
and sufﬁcient for the considered problem, see [36] for a
detailed derivation. We emphasize that the switching
time tH characterizes the optimal time of collaboration
since every investment in supplier development up to tH
results in an increased proﬁt while expenditures spent
after tH do not amortize during the contract period and are,
thus, not economically reasonable within the considered
setting.

cooperate with a different supplier instead of adhere to the
already existing business relation, see, e.g., [12] and [36]
for the considered setting with multiple suppliers. Here,
however, it is supposed that continuation of the collaboration is preferable since our focus is on the arrangement of
the manufacturer/supplier cooperation. Hence, Option 1
corresponds to the scenario, in which supplier development
cannot increase proﬁtability within the supply chain and
the cooperation with another supplier acting on the market
is also not economically reasonable. Hence, we focus on
the second case within this paper.
Here, from the speciﬁc structure (8) of the optimal
control function we can conclude that all investments up to
time tH pay off during the contract period. Then, taking
into account the already reduced supply costs given by

initial value x0 to the optimal value. The index T indicates
the contract period and can be considered as a parameter—
an interpretation, which is crucial for the upcoming
analysis.
Evidently, investments (in the cost structure) pay off in
the long run: while all the effort is spent directly at the
beginning of the collaboration, the resulting cost decreasing effect is exploited during the remainder of the contract
period.
H

Remark 1 At the switching time t , the marginal revenue
of further investments in supplier development (given by
the adjoint variable k) equals the marginal costs (given by
cSD ) as indicated in Fig. 1. This reasoning is expressed by
the switching condition (9).

4 Interplay of switching time and contract period
If the desired contract between manufacturer M and supplier S ranges over the interval [0, T], two cases can be
distinguished:
1.

2.

The (optimal) switching time is given by tH ¼ 0
meaning that investments in supplier development do
not pay off during the contract period.
A switching time tH [ 0 represents the scenario where
investing into supplier development amortizes during
the contract period.

After determining the outcome of a potential collaboration
over the interval [0, T], the overall market situation has to
be taken into account, e.g., does it make (more) sense to

further effort in terms of uðtÞ [ 0, t 2 ½tH ; TÞ, does not lead
to an increased proﬁt. The latter holds true since cost-reduction efforts after tH do not amortize within the
remaining time interval of at most length T À tH and are,
thus, not economically reasonable. We show that a prolongation of the contract period yields an augmentation of
the investments in supplier development, which corresponds to an increased switching time tH . A proof of
Lemma 1 is given in ‘‘Appendix 8’’.
Lemma 1 Suppose that the contract period T is chosen
(long enough) such that tH ¼ tH ðTÞ [ 0 holds. In addition,
let the condition
ð1 À mÞða À cM À c0 Þ þ c0 m ! 0

ð10Þ

hold. Then prolonging the contract period T, T [ T, implies a strictly larger switching time tH ¼ tH ðTÞ,
i.e., tH ðTÞ [ tH ðTÞ.
Remark 2 The assumptions of Lemma 1 imply the
inequality a À cM À c0 À r [ 0 as a by-product because the
manufacturer cannot realize a proﬁt per unit sold otherwise
(prohibitive price is greater than the production cost per
unit at time t ¼ 0 from the manufacturer’s point of view).
Hence, the seemingly technical Condition (10) links the
supplier’s production costs c0 with the difference of proﬁt
per unit a À cM À c0 by the learning rate m. Note that the
assumptions of Lemma 1 can be easily veriﬁed for a given
dataset of parameters.
Lemma 1 shows that investments in supplier development are extended if the contract period is prolonged.
Hence, the collaboration continues after the previously
determined switching time tH . As a result, the supplier’s

unit production costs are further decreased, the quantity
offered is increased and the supply chain proﬁt per time
unit grows. The argument that a longer contract period
leads to larger switching times can also be validated
numerically as visualized in Fig. 2. Here, we observe that
the supply costs cSC ðtÞ ¼ r þ c0 xðtÞm are further reduced
if both the manufacturer and the supplier agree on a
longer contract period. The relation between the contract
period T and the optimal switching time tH ðTÞ is almost
linear.2
In summary and according to the initial question how
does the contract period, i.e., planning horizon, affect
ﬁrms’ willingness to commit relationship-speciﬁc resources
to supplier development, the ﬁndings show that the supply
chain partners’ incentives to commit relationship-speciﬁc
resources, i.e., to invest in cost-reduction efforts, critically
depend on the length of the contract period.

5 Successive prolongation of the contract period
The beneﬁts of an increased switching time come along
with the inﬂexibility resulting from long-term contracts. In
this section, we propose a methodology for assisting supply
chain partners in contract negotiations to achieve the
beneﬁts of long-term contracts while committing themselves only to agreements of a certain, prespeciﬁed (collaboration) time period. To this end, it is assumed that the
manufacturer and the supplier are only content to make
contracts of length T. If the collaboration is successful for a
certain amount of time ½0; DTÞ, DT tH , they might agree
to renew the contract on the time interval ½DT; T þ DT.
Before we continue the discussion, let us brieﬂy sketch
the computation of the (optimal) control function uH : ½DT; T þ DTÞ ! ½0; x. Here, the proﬁt function
has to be maximized based on the new (initial) state xðDTÞ,

5.1 Receding horizon control
The idea of an iterative prolongation of collaboration
contracts can be algorithmically formalized as receding
horizon control (RHC) also known as model predictive
control.

Upon start, the manufacturer M and the supplier S agree
on a collaboration for a given contract period of length
^
T. Firstly, the status quo—represented by x—is analysed.
Secondly, the optimal switching time tH is computed based
^
on the initial state x and T, cf. Step (2). This yields the
optimal control strategy deﬁned by (13), of which the ﬁrst
piece uH j½0;DTÞ is applied. Then, the manufacturer and the
supplier meet again at time t þ DT to negotiate a new
contract. This initiates the process again, i.e.. the

previously described steps are repeated, which is referred
to as receding horizon principle. Note that since the
underlying system dynamics are time invariant, the newly
^
(measured) initial state x represents all information
required. In particular, no knowledge regarding the previously applied control is needed to solve the adapted
switching condition of Step (2) with respect to tH . Figure 3
illustrates the outcome of Algorithm 1 with prediction
horizon T ¼ 60 (contract period) and control horizon DT ¼ 3 (time step) based on the parameters given in
Table 1.

Firstly (t ¼ 0), the original optimal control problem is
solved resulting in tH % 9:21. Then, uH  x is applied on
the time interval ½0; DTÞ. Secondly (t ¼ DT), the collaboration is prolonged to tH % 9:74. Thirdly (t ¼ 2DT), the
switching time is shifted to tH % 10:27. Still, t ¼ 3DT tH
^
holds. Hence, the (measured) initial state x is given by
x0 þ tx ¼ x0 þ 3DTx. Here, Step (2) of Algorithm (1)
yields tH % 10:79, i.e., the collaboration stops within the
time frame ½t; t þ DTÞ. If the RHC scheme is further


applied, there occur collaboration intervals of shrinking
length.
As already discussed in Sect. 5, if the contract is not
renewed, uH ðtÞ is set to zero for t ! tH % 9:21. In contrast
to that, the RHC scheme prolongs the collaboration and,
thus, increases the supply chain proﬁt. To be more precise,

While an increased switching time tH may already
increase the proﬁtability within a supply chain during the
considered time span, the achieved cost reduction sustains. Hence, if the collaboration between the manufacturer and the supplier lasts, the obtained effect is a
sustainable one.
In summary and referring to the question how does
receding horizon control offer a straightforward method
for dynamically extending the planning horizon, the ﬁndings show that dynamically extending contracts enhance
the supplier development process, because value generation is facilitated while both the manufacturer and the
supplier gain ﬂexibility due to shorter contract periods.
5.2 Optimal point of collaboration
As observed in Fig. 3, the collaboration can stop within the
time interval ½t; t þ DTÞ meaning that the prerequisite DT tH is no longer satisﬁed at time t. This leads to a
sequence of collaboration times of shrinking length.
Summing up all of these intervals on the inﬁnite horizon
yields a total collaboration time of approximately 11.18
time units. Hence, the total collaboration time is increased
by 21.3 %. However, since the collaboration intervals are
becoming comparably short, implementing this strategy
may be impracticable. Here, we propose two remedies: If
the new collaboration period at time t ¼ kDT, i.e., tH À t,
is below a certain threshold value,

set tH ¼ t in order to save negotiation costs, which
would probably outweigh the achievable earning
growth. For the presented example, the supplier
development programme stops at 10.79 (still an
increase of approximately 17.2 %) if the threshold is 1.

state is x ¼ 10:79 while x % 11:18. Hence, a collaboration of length 0.39 time units is ﬁxed. At all
upcoming time instants, tH ¼ t holds because the
optimal cost structure for contract periods of
length T ¼ 60 is already reached.

Clearly, the threshold should be chosen such that the proﬁt
increase outweighs the negotiation costs.
Thus, Algorithm 1 allows both the manufacturer and the
supplier to prolong their supplier development programme
without binding themselves for a time span longer
than T and, thus, provides more ﬂexibility.
Remark 3 Algorithm 1 is a simpliﬁed version. Indeed, the
time step DT may vary in time, e.g., longer time steps in
the beginning (for example, DT ¼ tH in the considered
setting), and shorter ones later on. For details on the socalled time-varying control horizon, we refer to [15].
In summary and with regard to the question how should
receding horizon control be arranged to optimize supply
chain proﬁt, two strategies are presented in order to make
the proposed receding horizon scheme, cf. Algorithm 1,
applicable even if negotiation costs are taken into account.

6 Numerical results
As seen in the previous section, applying the receding
horizon Algorithm 1 dynamically extends the collaboration
within the supply chain and, thus, generates additional
proﬁt within the supply chain. Next, we conduct a
numerical case study to obtain further managerial insights.
To this end, we compare the outcome J HH of the proposed algorithm based on the second option presented in
Sect. 5.2 and the supply chain proﬁt resulting from the

considered on [0, 60] and, then, utilizing the achieved cost
structure cSC ðtÞ ¼ x0 þ tH x on [60, 120] without further
investments in supplier development. The corresponding
proﬁt is given by (14).
To fully understand the impact of receding horizon
control on the supply chain proﬁt in depth, we ﬁrst vary the
following parameters of Table 1

Second, we are interested in the interplay of the supplier’s learning rate m and receding horizon control. Thus,
based on the parameters of Table 1, we perform a sensitivity analysis with respect to the parameter m with

Applying Algorithm 1 (T ¼ 60, DT ¼ 3), Fig. 5 shows
both the optimal switching time tH (without receding
horizon control) compared to the optimal switching time
tHH (with receding horizon control) in dependence of
m (left), and the proﬁt growth with respect to the switching
time for different learning rates (right). Again, the computations are based on a simulation of 120 time units. Here,
we observe that the impact of receding horizon control
decreases for lower learning rates.
Hence, the results infer that especially ﬁrms in highlearning industries, e.g., technology-based industries, beneﬁt most from applying the proposed receding horizon
scheme.

resulting in a total number of 75 = 16,807 instances. For
each parameter combination, we then evaluate the respective proﬁts.
The depicted histogram in Fig. 4 shows the absolute
frequency with which a percentage of proﬁt increase is
observed within our parameter set. The mean value
is 3.36 % with a standard deviation of 1.06 %. In conclusion, receding horizon control signiﬁcantly improves the
proﬁtability of the considered supply chain.

In this paper, we investigated the impact of the contract
period on supplier development. In particular, we showed
that the supply chain partners’ incentives to commit relationship-speciﬁc resources, i.e., to invest in cost-reduction
efforts, critically depend on the length of the contract
period.
Given the fact that long-term contracts entail certain
risks, we proposed a receding horizon control scheme to
mitigate possible contractual hazards. In addition, we
showed that dynamically extending contracts enhance the
supplier development process, because value generation is
facilitated while both the manufacturer and the supplier
gain ﬂexibility due to shorter contract periods. Furthermore, we presented two strategies in order to make the

proposed receding horizon scheme, cf. Algorithm 1,
applicable even if negotiation costs are taken into account.
Finally, we veriﬁed the reliability of the application by
performing Algorithm 1 for an extensive parameter set and
demonstrated that receding horizon control leads to a signiﬁcant proﬁt increase within the supply chain. Moreover,
by means of a sensitivity analysis with respect to the
learning rate, we showed that especially ﬁrms in highlearning industries beneﬁt since supplier development
programmes play a predominant role in order to optimize
the cost structure of the supplier network.
The study is based on a simple model to focus on the
impact of dynamical decision-making in supplier development. Clearly, a more elaborated model with less stringent assumptions like, e.g., a linear price distribution,
should be studied in the future. Moreover, the combination
of the proposed dynamic strategy with decentralized
approaches is of great importance and deserved a detailed
analysis, see, e.g., the negotiation-based coordination
mechanism proposed in [36]. Another interesting direction
for future research is to expand our study to a network
perspective, in which the supply chain consists of more
than a single manufacturer and a single supplier, see,
e.g., [13], where two manufacturers are engaged in the
development of a supplier.
