INTRODUCTION

Many multinational manufacturing companies have
moved towards becoming service providers. The
service provider role of the major manufacturers is
prevalent in sectors like Information and
Communication Technology (ICT), automotive, and
aerospace where the companies offer a range of aftersales services. One of the forms of after-sales

services is to provide service parts (also known as
spare parts and repair parts) for equipment
maintenance and repairs at customer sites. This study
is mainly motivated by Service Parts Logistics (SPL)
systems of ICT equipment manufacturers and service
providers that support provision of service parts
under different and short service time commitments
to the customer base, which is spread over a large
geographical area. Typically in ICT hardware support
contracts, depending on the consequences of their
equipment downtime, customers determine different
time windows (e.g. 2 hours, 4 hours and 8 hours)
within which the requested service part(s) should
reach their sites. The study is, however, generic in
nature and generates insights that can be relevant for
cases where the service responses are provided within
different short time windows and involve the
provision (or consumption) of stock (e.g. emergency
infrastructure repairs on the road network).
Differentiation is not a new topic in inventory
research. The inventory research relating to
differentiation dates back to the 1960s. The problem
of multiple demand classes was introduced by
Veinott Jr [1], who focused on the question of how
much to order and when to replenish within a
periodic review system where, in each period, the
requests are satisfied in a sequence which is in
accordance with the priority of their classes. Since
this study, a stream of service-differentiated research
has been published, the majority of which is in the
context of service parts and relates to fill-rate (service
availability) based differentiation through inventory
rationing. Time-based service differentiation has
received comparatively less attention in inventory
and facility location research. There are few studies
that consider differentiating customers based on
different service (supply) time options that they
choose. Kranenburg and van Houtum [2] consider a
single facility and multiple customer groups, each
having a service level equal to the maximum average
waiting time at the warehouse. The facility has a
normal and an emergency replenishment option: the
emergency replenishment mode is used in case of a
stock-out and is quicker and more expensive. Their
model seeks to determine the stock level at the
facility that minimizes the cost (sum of inventory
Kranenburg and van Houtum [3] study a similar
system as in [2], but they use a stock rationing policy
as a means to offer a fill-rate differentiation to the
customer groups as well. Kranenburg and van
Houtum [4] extend the model in [2] by considering
multiple warehouses instead of a single facility
system. These studies [2-4] only consider customer
waiting times at warehouses, assuming that
customers instantly get parts when they are released
by a warehouse. The travel distance to reach
customers, which can be an important factor when
the service times are short (e.g. typically a few hours
in IT equipment support services), is not considered.
Apparently the travel time can make a considerable
difference in the overall service time [5, 6]. Service
time constraints imply a demand covering issue
within certain distance ranges associated with the
maximum service times. The SPL studies that do
account for service time constraints and warehousecustomer distances for inventory and facility location
decisions, on the other hand, lack the service
differentiation aspect [e.g. 7-12].
The number of stocking facilities in a distribution
network affects its responsiveness and costs. Setting
the level of centralization/decentralization in a
distribution network is a well-argued strategic
decision and has various trade-offs (see [13]). These
trade-offs include warehouse-to-customer travelling
distances, inventory costs, and responsiveness. A
centralized distribution setup results in lower
inventory costs as, compared to a decentralized setup,
it requires a lower inventory level to attain a
particular service level. On the other hand, a
decentralized distribution network can result in better
responsiveness and lower warehouse-to-customer
travelling distance. The early text books referring to
stock centralization and decentralization concepts
include [14, 15]. Key differences between attributes
of centralized and decentralized strategies for aftersales services are identified in [16, 17]. Studies
generally assume that a supply in shorter time
windows results in higher costs (e.g. [16-18]).
However, the exploration into how different service
time limits and the demand composition impact on
distribution costs has been overlooked in the facility
location literature generally and the SPL literature
specifically.
Most SPL studies are focused on the optimization of
inventory policy parameters. Kennedy et al. [19]
discuss unique aspects of service parts inventories
and review the related literature. Muckstadt [20]
presents details of service parts inventory systems
and supply chain algorithms, and provides an
extensive bibliography on the subject. A considerable
portion of research on service parts inventory
management has focused on lateral transhipment or
inventory sharing. Paterson et al. [21] provide a
comprehensive review of the literature in this area till

2011, while Patriarca et al. [22] outline the more
recent developments. But despite the significant
research in SPL, it is reported that there is a gap
between practice and academic literature in this area.
Not many companies apply the complex concepts
that exist in the literature. Several authors have
mentioned the use of basic inventory management
techniques for service parts. Ashayeri et al. [23]
found that their case, a company in the IT sector,
used the EOQ (Economic Order Quantity) policy for
consumable service parts inventory management, and
it had proved to be reliable enough. The survey in
[24] also indicates that basic, understandable
inventory management techniques, including the
EOQ model, are used commonly for service parts.
Similarly, Huiskonen [25] reports that most basic
inventory theory and models have been widely
applied in practice and there is relatively little
evidence of the use of more sophisticated
applications, such as multi-echelon models.
The aim of this work is to provide insights into the
relationship between service times, distribution setup,
and inventory and transportation costs in a system
where parts/materials are supplied within different
service time windows. In scenarios where there are
multiple levels of service, there can be two logical
options to meet the requirements of all customers.
One is to set up a system that has a uniform
capability of meeting the toughest requirement for the
entire customer base. The other is to set up a system
that has variable capabilities to meet different
requirements determined by different customers.
Apparently, apart from being less complex, operating
a system with a uniform capability (the first option) is
unappealing. A uniform capability, which is tuned to
meet the most stringent customer requirement, can
result in overspending and does not include any
mechanism to transfer cost benefits to customers
requiring relaxed services. The problem is analysed
by developing an estimate cost model considering a
stylized system under two distinct organizations of
stocking facilities, namely a hierarchical organization
and a non-hierarchical organization.
Many real-world location problems involve facility
systems that are hierarchical in nature, providing
multiple levels of service through different types of
facilities [26]. Expanding a location problem to
consider more than one level of facility though
increases the complexity of the problem [27, 28, 29].
Şahin and Süral [29] and, comparatively recently,
Farahani et al. [30] have surveyed and classified the
literature on hierarchical facility location problems.
The objective of a hierarchical location model can be
to locate different types of facilities and allocate them
different types of customers such that some cost is
minimized [e.g. 31], maximum number of customers
are covered [e.g. 32], or all customers are covered
[e.g. 33]. The last objective is rarely investigated, so
is the consideration of continuous location. The
being nested and non-nested systems. In a nested
hierarchy, a higher-level facility provides all the
services provided by a lower-level facility and at
least one additional service. While in a non-nested
hierarchy, facilities at each level offer different
services. Chistaller’s hierarchical central places is a
classical nested hierarchical system having a
hexagonal pattern in a plane with continuous
customer spread [34, 35]. In this system (Figure 1),

3

‘central places of higher order’ are defined as those
that serve in a bigger region, in which other central
places exist. In a higher level, not only the services of
the higher order are offered, but those of the lower
orders are also offered. The system comprises
different circular ranges of central places depending
on their types. To serve the entire land, a perfect and
uniform net of central places is created, resulting in a
hierarchical hexagonal pattern.

Figure 1: Circular range limits in central places system (from [36])

Similar to Chistaller’s hierarchical central places, this
paper considers a nest hierarchical organization of
service areas to exploit the opportunity to centralize
the distribution for demand for longer service time
windows. This is compared with a non-hierarchical
system,
having
the
maximum
level
of
decentralization and operating in a uniform fashion
by distributing from the closest stocking facility
regardless of the requested service time. The EOQ
and the one-for-one (S-1, S) inventory policies are
incorporated to investigate high and low demand
rates respectively. The analysis focuses on the
decentralization-centralization
trade-off
under
multiple distance constraints and provides novel
managerial insights into the service time and service
cost relationship by considering the spatial aspect.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows.
Section 2 describes the problem and lists the
assumptions made for the model formulation. Section
3 presents the model formulation under the
hierarchical and the non-hierarchical setups. The
formulation is followed by the analysis in Section 4
based on various numerical experiments. The paper is
concluded in Section 5.

PROBLEM
DESCRIPTION
ASSUMPTIONS

AND

Consider a set of demand points uniformly spread
over a large geographical area. Customers have to be
supplied with parts within different contracted
service time commitments. A service type is
associated with a particular maximum duration or a
time window, translated into a service distance
constraint, to deliver a part at a demand location. The
strictness of a service type relates to how short the
service distance constraint of the service type is; the
strictest service being the one with the shortest
service distance constraint. Demand fractions
correspond to the proportion of total demand linked
with different service types, such that the sum of all
demand fractions is 1. In order to meet a service time
commitment in the entire service area, every client
location should be within the corresponding service
distance constraint from at least one service parts
storage facility. From now on, the paper refers to
storage facilities, where parts are stored and from
where they are dispatched to customers, as just
facilities. Facilities are located to cover the entire
area efficiently considering the strictest service’s
distance constraint. Under the non-hierarchical setup
all facilities offer the full service range in their
hierarchical setup, though all facilities provide the
strictest service, only a subset of facilities provide
services with longer distance constraints, in larger
service areas, leading to a higher level of
centralization in the system.
The aim is to determine the impact of changing the
service distance constraints and demand fractions of
different service types on the distribution network
setup and inventory and transportation costs.
Following assumptions are made to study the
problem under the hierarchical and the nonhierarchical (completely decentralized) setups:
1. The EOQ model is considered for inventory
ordering. It is a commonly used model for
inventories and allows a tractable formulation to
convey the main insights. A cross industry
exploratory investigation in [37] shows that many
of the predictions from classical inventory
models, such as the EOQ model, extend beyond
individual products to the aggregate firm level.
Hence, these models can help with high-level
strategic choices in addition to tactical decisions.
2. The problem is also formulated and analysed
under the (S-1, S) inventory policy, which is
considered to be appropriate for slow moving
items and is a widely noted inventory policy in
the SPL literature. The following commonly used
assumptions are considered for the (S-1, S)
policy: single item; demand arrives one at a time
according to the Poisson process; backorders
allowed; and no capacity constraints on the
supply (replenishment). It is pertinent to mention
that under the EOQ based (R, Q) policy, with a
constraint on stock-out probability during the lead
time, the order quantity Q can be determined as
the EOQ and the reorder point R can be
determined in the same way as the base stock S is
computed under the (S-1, S) policy.
3. Demand is assumed to have a uniform spread
over the area, which is to be covered by a singleechelon distribution system. It can be argued that
considering a demand area rather than a finite set
of demand points is more realistic as demand may
move and increase or decrease. It is also assumed
that travelling distances are Euclidean and
proportional to travel time. Examples of studies
with such simplifying assumptions can be found
in [36].
4. It is assumed that the area to be covered to
provide services is large and that the services
have to be provided within short time
commitments. Typically, large IT companies
cover vast geographical areas for service parts
distribution through several service facilities.
Considering that the facility costs are dominating,
the system comprises the minimum number of
facilities that can provide the complete demand

coverage considering a service time constraint.
Cohen et al. [16] suggest that having a high
number of storage facilities, when the customer
need is not urgent, is a mismatched SPL strategy.
Responsiveness comes at a significant cost in a
typical SPL system [12].
A regular hexagonal packing of service
catchment areas is considered, assuming that
facility points are located efficiently to cover the
entire area for the strictest service time
commitment, and that a service request is fulfilled
by the nearest service facility offering the
required service. The hexagonal partitioning is
considered to be efficient when assuming
Euclidean distances. Out of the shapes that can
tile a plane with perfect packing, hexagons cover
the maximum area considering a distance
constraint from the centre, and have the minimum
average distance to the centre considering a fixed
area size [38]. Okabe et al. [36] include a
Voronoi diagram based computational method for
determining the efficient location and service
areas of given number of non-hierarchical facility
points in an area with different demand density
functions. Their approximate optimum solutions
are hexagonal patterns of service areas with
different concentrations of facilities depending on
the density functions. Examples of service system
studies that consider a regular hexagonal pattern
of service catchment areas for their analysis
include [39, 40].
For an analytical treatment, boundary effects and
rounding off errors are ignored in determining the
number of facilities. Hence the analysis is an
approximation. To calculate the number of
facilities the total area is divided by a facility
catchment area (a full hexagonal area determined
according to the maximum distance that can be
travelled within a committed service time), which
can result in a fractional number. Secondly,
packing an area in a plane with full identical
hexagons may not provide complete coverage,
and typically, areas on the boundaries of the
region may need to be covered by partial
hexagons and need additional facilities. Simply
dividing an entire service area with a facility
catchment area can underestimate the number of
facilities required for the coverage. Nevertheless,
the boundary effect becomes less significant in
case of a large overall area covered by a high
number of regular hexagons [38, 41]. It can be
shown that the boundary effect diminishes when
the overall area becomes large, and hence, the
estimations from the cost formulae improve.
THE MODEL

The model represents non-hierarchical and
a shorter time window for a delivery. Let Type 1
service be the least strict service and Type k service
be a stricter service than all Type k – i services,
where 2 ≤ k ≤ m and 1 ≤ i < k. Hence m is the total
number of service types and a Type m service is the
strictest service.
Below is the list of the notations used for formulating
the demand compositions under the non-hierarchical
and the hierarchical setups:
A:
total area to be served (a large geographical
area)
λ:
total demand in area A, i.e. the total number of
service calls per unit time
m:
total number of service types

f k:

service distance constraint for Type k service,
sk:
where k = 1 … m and sm is the shortest distance
constraint
n k:
number of facilities providing Type k service,
where k = 1 … m and nm is the total number of
facilities in the system
3.1 Non-hierarchical setup of service facilities
The non-hierarchical setup consists of only one
facility type. All service facilities provide the full
range of service types, i.e. all Type k services, where
k = 1 … m. All facility catchment areas are marked
considering the maximum distance that can be
covered from a service facility to provide the strictest
(Type m) service (Figure 2).

Figure 2: Non-hierarchical setup

s

m

sm

Service facility
Demand location
Service route for all service types

As sm is the maximum distance that can be covered
from a service facility to provide a Type m service, it
is also equal to the edge length of the hexagonal
service catchment areas of a facility (Figure 2). The
total number of facilities (nm) is determined as
A

3 3 ( sm ) 2 / 2 , where 3 3 (sm ) / 2 is the hexagonal
2

catchment area of a service facility with an edge
length of sm. As each facility provides the complete
set of service types, nk is the same for k = 1 … m.
Consequently, the total demand served by one facility
is λ/nm.
3.2. Hierarchical setup of service facilities
A nested hierarchy of facilities and service areas is
considered to present a system that avails itself of the
centres (facility points) of lower level hexagons 1) at
the middle of the edges of the higher level hexagons,
or 2) at the corner points of the higher level hexagons

(Figure 3). These two approaches result in different
ratios between the maximum distances (or service
time constraints) within the higher and lower level
hexagons.

Figure 5 depicts the hierarchical system considering
two service types; the strict service and the relaxed
service (the latter having the longer distance
constraint). Though the figure depicts a hierarchical
hexagonal pattern in which the centres of lower level
hexagons are located at the middle of the edges of

higher level hexagons, the formulation can also be
used to study the service time ratios resulting from
the other pattern. The ratio between the different
service time constraints that the pattern in Figure 5

The hierarchical setup providing two service time
options consists of two types of service facilities; the
higher-level facilities providing both the relaxed and
the strict services, and the lower-level facilities only
provide the strict service. A higher-level facility has
two service catchment areas; the first within the strict
service distance constraint and the second within the
relaxed service distance constraint. All customers
within the first catchment area of a higher-level
facility can get both types of service from the higherlevel facility, whereas the customers beyond the first
catchment area and within the second catchment area
can only get the relaxed service. Unlike higher-level
facilities, a lower-level facility has only one
catchment area, which is within the strict service

distance constraint. A lower-level facility can only
provide the strict service to the customers within its
catchment area. For the relaxed service, the
customers within a lower-level facility’s catchment
area are served by the closest higher-level facility.
From the notations, s1 and s2 are the maximum
distances that can be covered from a service facility to
provide the relaxed and strict services respectively.
Consequently, s1 and s2 are equal to the edge length of
a hexagonal catchment area for providing the relaxed
and the strict services respectively. In the hierarchical
setup presented in Figure 5, the maximum distance
distances, if the time constraint for the relaxed service
is 8 hours, the possible time constraints for the strict
service can be 4 hours, 2 hours, 1 hour and so on.
A generic formulation is now presented for a nested
hierarchical system providing two or more time-based
service types. The number of facilities providing Type
A
,
k service, i.e. nk, is determined as
3 3 (sk 2 ) / 2
2

where 3 3 ( s k ) / 2 is the hexagonal catchment area
of a service facility for Type k service provision. A
higher-level facility provides a more relaxed service
in addition to all the services provided by the lowerlevel facilities. Let Type 1 facilities be the highest
level facilities providing the complete set of services.

Let Type k facilities be lower-level facilities than all
Type k – i service facilities, where 2 ≤ k ≤ m and 1 ≤ i
< k, providing a Type k service and all the services
that are stricter than Type k service (Table 1). Hence a
Type m facility is the lowest level facility, only
providing Type m (the strictest) service, and m is the
total number of service facility types. For instance,
assuming a successively inclusive hierarchical system
providing three service types, a Type 1 service is the
least strict service, a Type 2 service is stricter than
Type 1 service, and a Type 3 service is the strictest
service. In terms of the facility hierarchy, Type 1,
Type 2, and Type 3 are the types of facilities in
descending order of their level – Type 1 being the
highest level facilities and Type 3 being the lowest.

Considering the classification of service facilities
presented above, the number of Type k facilities is
estimated as nk – nk-1, where k = 1 … m and n0 = 0.
For example, the number of Type 3 facilities (i.e. k =
3) equals n3 – n2, where n3 is the number of facilities

3.3 Cost formulations
The cost functions are formulated considering the
expressions for the demand composition presented
above (Sections 3.1 and 3.2), the EOQ policy, and the
average distance to reach customers in a hexagonal
area. The problem is studied considering the one-forone (S-1, S) inventory policy in Section 3.4. The
following additional notations are introduced:
λ:
total demand in area A, i.e. the total number
of service calls per unit time
r:
cost per inventory replenishment order
h:
holding cost per unit per unit time
t:
transportation cost per unit distance
TICNH: total inventory cost per unit time under the
non-hierarchical setup
TICH: total inventory cost per unit time under the
hierarchical setup
TTCNH: total transportation cost per unit time under
the non-hierarchical setup
TTCH: total transportation cost per unit time under
the hierarchical setup

Under the non-hierarchical setup, since λ/nm is the
demand served by one facility (Section 3.1),
λ is the inventory cost per unit time at one
2rh

nm

facility. With nm as the total number of facilities we
get the following inventory cost estimation function
for the non-hierarchical setup:
TICNH = nm 2rh λ = 2rhλnm

(2)

Under the hierarchical setup, considering the demand
served by one Type k facility (1), and the number of

Considering the two level hierarchical system,
providing a strict and a relaxed service, three extreme
cases, or benchmarks, of the inventory cost can be
identified. 1) When there is only one facility
providing the service (i.e. a completely centralized
system), the cyclic inventory cost, as mentioned
earlier, equals 2rhλ . 2) When there is no demand
for the strict service, i.e. f2 = 0 and f1 = 1, the
multiplication factor (4) equals 1, reducing the total
inventory cost function (3) to

2rhλn1 , i.e. the cost

n1 compared to the

increases by the factor of

completely centralized case. 3) When there is no
demand for the relaxed service, i.e. f1 = 0 and f2 = 1,
and hence the system becomes completely
decentralized, the multiplication factor (4) becomes
n2 n1 , reducing the inventory cost function to

2rhλn2 . In other words, the cost increases by the
factor

of

n2

compared

to

(3)

the

completely

centralized case.
When considering Euclidean travelling distances, a
uniform geographical distribution of customers, and

(4)

hexagonal service areas with facilities located at their
centres, the average distance to reach a customer is
(1/3 + ln3/4)s ≈ 0.60799(s), where s is the edge length
of the hexagonal service area (see [42] for details on
the average distance). Under the non-hierarchical
setup, since sm is the edge length of a service area, the
average distance to reach a customer is estimated as
0.60799(sm). Subsequently, the following function
estimates the transportation cost under the nonhierarchical setup:
TTCNH = 0.60799 s m λt

(5)

Under the hierarchical setup, considering 0.60799(sk)
as the average distance to serve a customer for a
Type k service, where sk is the edge length of a
hexagonal service area for Type k service, the
following function estimates transportation cost:

The transportation cost function and the

In the two level system, when there is no demand for
the strict service (f2 = 0) the multiplication factor for
the transportation cost (7) equals to 1 and the
transportation cost becomes independent of the ratio
between the strict and the relaxed service times. With
the presence of demand for the strict service (f2 > 0),
the smaller the distance constraint for the strict
service, resulting in smaller strict service areas, the

3.4 Considering the (S-1, S) inventory policy
Finally, let L be the replenishment lead time and S be
the base-stock level at a facility with the (S-1, S)
inventory policy. The value of S can be determined
through the steady state probability of the quantity of
units in resupply. Note that there is a well-known
relationship between stock-out probability and fillrate (fraction of demand met from stocks on hand)
under the (S-1, S) inventory policy [20, 43, 44].
Considering that all the demand is met by one
facility, the fill-rate under the (S-1, S) policy is equal

The analysis considers two service types, referred to
as the strict and the relaxed services. Type 1 and
Type 2 facilities in the hierarchical setup are referred
to as higher and lower-level facilities respectively.
The multiplication factors for inventory and
transportation costs under the hierarchical setup are
analysed first and then the non-hierarchical and the
hierarchical setups are investigated and compared
over different service distance constraints and demand
compositions.
Figure 6, based on the multiplication factor for the
inventory cost (4), and Figure 7, based on the
multiplication factor for the transportation cost (7),
illustrate how inventory and transportation costs react
to the changes in s2/s1 ratio (0.5, 0.25, … 0.002) and
the demand fractions for the relaxed and strict
services. A smaller s2/s1 represents a greater time
difference between both service types, requiring
comparatively more lower-level facilities and a higher
level of decentralization. Likewise, a higher value of
f2 (the proportion of demand for the strict service)
means that more demand has to be fulfilled from
lower-level facilities, which are more decentralized.
Note that the non-hierarchical setup does not provide
an opportunity to perform this type of analysis as
entire demand, whether for the strict service or the
relaxed service, is met in a similar way (from the
same facilities). This is discussed further in the
examples.

For the non-hierarchical setup, the base stock level at

inventory is maintained when s2/s1 is at its minimum
service distance constraint for the strict service. With
maximum f2 there is no demand for the relaxed
service. This requires stocks to be maintained with
the maximum decentralization as there is no
allowance to meet demand from longer distances. In
this scenario, a system under the hierarchical setup

operates similarly to when it is under the nonhierarchical setup. When f2 is at its minimum (i.e. f2
= 0), the inventory levels are constant and minimum
as the total demand, composed of only relaxed
service calls, is met within the larger service areas of
more centralized higher-level facilities.

In contrast to inventory levels, travelling reduces
when s2/s1 decreases (Figure 7). The minimum
transportation cost results when s2/s1 is at its
minimum and f2 is at its maximum (i.e. f2 = 1). As
stated earlier, a smaller s2/s1 ratio results in more
lower-level facilities and maximum f2 results in the
total demand being fulfilled by facilities in smaller
catchment areas, which in turn results in lower
average travelling to serve customers. Transportation
cost is at the maximum level when f2 = 0, irrespective
of the s2/s1 value, because regardless of the number of
lower-level facilities, the total demand is served by
higher-level facilities within larger service areas.
The results from the computations based on the
following hypothetical values are presented to further
illustrate and compare the hierarchical and nonhierarchical setups. Let demand (λ) = 10,000 per
year, area (A) = 200,000-unit length2 (the area of the
mainland UK being 229,543 km2), and the relaxed
service distance constraint (s1) = 100-unit length.
Two sets of cost parameters values are considered to
represent a case where inventory cost
dominates and a case where transportation cost
dominates. In Case 1, with dominating inventory
cost, r = 500, h = 50, and t = 0.01. In Case 2, r = 100,
h = 10, and t = 0.2. The values for the strict service
distance constraint (s2) and the demand fractions for
both service types (f2 and f1) are altered for the
analysis.

Figure 8 presents the total cost calculations
(equations (8) and (9)) for varying f2, while retaining
s1 = 100 and s2 = 50-unit lengths. Under the nonhierarchical setup, the inventory cost (2) and the
transportation cost (5) remain unaffected by the
changes in the proportions of demand for both
service types. Under the hierarchical setup, a lower
proportion of demand for the strict service results in a
lower inventory cost (3) while a higher transportation
cost (6). The hierarchical setup performs better when
the inventory costs dominate (Figure 8a) as opposed
to when the transportation cost dominates (Figure
8b). It can exploit the opportunity to respond to
relaxed service calls with a higher level of
centralization, as a longer distance can be covered for
a delivery. Under the non-hierarchical setup, on the
other hand, the system cannot exploit this opportunity
and supplies items to customers with a constant level
of decentralization, i.e. from the closest facility.
Higher fraction of demand for the relaxed service
results in more centralized demand fulfilment within
larger service areas under the hierarchical setup,
which reduces the inventory but increases the average
service distance. The costs under both setups
converge when the fraction of demand for the strict
service increases; both setups operating in the

b) Case – 2: Dominating transportation cost
There are two inventory and transportations cost
benchmarks under the hierarchical setup. The first is
at the point where there is no demand for the strict
service (f2 = 0), hence the service is only provided
from the higher-level facilities in their larger service
areas, resulting in the lowest inventory cost and the
highest transportation cost in the system. The second
is at the point where there is no demand for the
relaxed service and hence the system operates as a
non-hierarchical system, resulting in the highest

inventory cost and the lowest transportation cost.
Both costs vary between these two levels depending
on the value of f2.
Figs. 9 and 10 show the impact of service distance
constraint on the distribution system and the service
cost. The reduction in the service time constraints
when s2 is small sharply increases the number of

s2
When the distance constraint for the strict service
decreases (keeping constant the relaxed service
distance constraint s1 and the proportions of demand
for both service types, f1 and f2), the inventory cost
under both setups increases, and so does the
difference by which the hierarchical setup performs
better than the non-hierarchical setup in terms of the
inventory cost (Figure 10). In contrast to the
inventory cost, the amount by which the nonhierarchical setup performs better than the
hierarchical setup in terms of the transportation cost
increases as the strict service distance (s2) decreases.

With a reduction in the time window for the strict
service, the non-hierarchical setup meets both types
of demand with a higher decentralization level,
whereas under the hierarchical setup, the
decentralization level for the relaxed service does not
change, making the inventory and transportation
costs under the hierarchical setup less sensitive to the
changes in s2. Overall, the hierarchical setup
performs better in Case 1, in which inventory costs
dominate, and the non-hierarchical setup performs
better in Case 2, having a higher transportation cost.

more demand is fulfilled in the smaller strict service

in size (Figure 11). Both these factors increase the

level of decentralization, which adversely impacts the
inventory cost performance while reducing the
transportation cost.

The final set of results is based on overall inventory
level computations considering the (S-1, S) inventory
policy under the modelled non-hierarchical and
hierarchical setups. The computations consider the
demand rate of 5 parts per day, fixing the
replenishment lead-time (L) at 1 day, and considering
the overall area as 200,000-unit length2.
(Computations based on the demand rate of 1 part per
day provided similar insights.) Figure 12 shows the
effect of varying demand fractions for both services
on inventory levels with the distance constraints for
the relaxed and strict services as 100 and 50-unit
lengths respectively, and the minimum fill-rate level
as 0.98. The results suggest that inventory levels
under the hierarchical setup (11) can be higher than
under the non-hierarchical setup (10). Under the nonhierarchical setup, the demand over the lead time at a
facility is 0.16, requiring the base-stock level to be 2

to satisfy the minimum fill-rate level of 0.98. As total
number of facilities (n2) is 30.79, the total inventory
under the non-hierarchical setup is considered as
2×30.79 = 62. Under the hierarchical setup, when
f2 = 0.1, the demand at a lower-level facility is 0.02,
requiring the base-stock level to be 1, and the
demand at a higher-level facility is 0.6, requiring the
base-stock level to be 4. With n2 – n1 = 23.09 and n1
= 7.698, the total inventory is taken as (1×23.09) +
(4×7.698) = 54. When f2 = 0.2, lesser demand is
consolidated at the higher-level facilities (0.55 over
the lead time), requiring 3 units as the base-stock,
while more demand is shifted to the lower-level
facilities (0.03 per unit time), increasing the required
base-stock level to 2. This increases the overall
inventory to 70, which is higher than the total
inventory under the non-hierarchical setup.

With equal fractions of demand for both service types
and the minimum fill-rate level as 0.98, Figure 13
shows the impact of reducing service distance
constraints (such that s1 = 2s2) on inventory levels.
Both setups see an increase in their inventory levels
as the distance constraint for the strict service

reduces, resulting in a higher number of facilities and
more decentralization. Again there are instances
(when s2 = 20 & 50) where the hierarchical setup
results in more inventory compared to that under the
non-hierarchical
setup.

The computations considering (S-1, S) policy provide
an interesting observation. The results suggest that
even though the level of centralization is higher
under the hierarchical setup, the inventory levels
under the completely decentralized non-hierarchical
setup can be lower. The reason behind this
phenomenon is that a slight reduction in demand at a
facility does not always allow the facility’s base
stock level to be reduced. Although transforming a
system from the non-hierarchical setup to the
hierarchical setup reduces demand at the lower-level
facilities, the required base stock levels at these
facilities cannot necessarily be reduced while
maintaining the minimum fill-rate level. On the other
hand, the transformation increases demand at higherlevel facilities and can potentially increase the
required base stock levels at these facilities to
maintain the minimum fill-rate level. Hence, on the
whole, this can increase the stocks in the system. The
SPL systems of two major multinational IT
equipment manufacturers that the author has studied
operate in a non-hierarchical way. The above analysis
shows that a non-hierarchical setup, besides being
simpler, is not necessarily inferior to a hierarchical
setup.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSION

The presented model and analysis explore the effects
of different service time constraints on some of the
important components of distribution cost. The
results presented in the preceding sections show how
service time constraints and the proportions of
demand for different time-based service types can
impact on inventory and transportation costs.
Under the EOQ inventory policy, the results show
that distribution through a hierarchical organization
of facilities, where customers are not necessarily

served from the nearest stocking point (in order to
allow a higher level of centralization while adhering
to service time commitments), can lower the overall
inventory levels. However, this is at the expense of
increased transportation cost. Inventory cost
decreases while transportation cost increases with the
increase in the demand proportion for the relaxed
service. In contrast, a non-hierarchical organization
of service facilities, in which all customers are served
from the nearest stocking point, can result in a lower
average distance to reach customers at the expense of
higher inventory cost. Also, as a non-hierarchical
system treats all service calls in a similar fashion,
overall similar inventory and transportation costs are
incurred in serving customers with different service
time requirements. The analysis shows that it can be
beneficial to deploy stocks with high inventory
related costs in a hierarchical fashion, while
deploying stocks with low inventory related costs in a
non-hierarchical fashion.
The investigation based on the (S-1, S) inventory
policy gives some counterintuitive outcomes. Besides
being the costlier option in terms of transportation, a
hierarchical setup might not necessarily result in a
lower total base-stock level compared to a nonhierarchical setup. Under the hierarchical setup, due
to the discrete nature of the (S-1, S) inventory policy,
inventory levels change stepwise when the demand
proportions of the service types change; in several
cases exceeding the required inventory level under
the non-hierarchical setup. In such cases it can be
financially better to distribute under a more
decentralized (and hence more responsive) system as
both inventory and transportation levels in the system
can be lower.
It is important to emphasise the limitations of this
research approach. Many of the assumptions in this
a real world system. However, the model provides a
non-complex tool for analysing distribution cost
under constrained centralization levels. The analysis
generates important generic insights which may not
be generated through studying specific real life setups
or instances. The insights can be useful to understand
the likely impacts of different scenarios in timedifferentiated distribution and can aid decisionmaking. The research could be extended in several
ways, for example by considering inventory sharing
in overlapping service ranges, service of multiple
customers in one trip, and fill-rate based
differentiation.
