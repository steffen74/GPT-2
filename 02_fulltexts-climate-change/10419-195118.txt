Introduction



series of processes and supplies the product to the market with reasonable price [1, 2]. The
definition of remanufacturing is based on the “Act on the promotion of the conversion into
environmental friendly industrial structure” in Korea. Remanufacturing is to make renewable
resources into a state where they can keep their original performance after undergoing a series of
processes such as disassembly, cleansing, examination, repair, adjustment, recombination, etc.
[3]. On the other hand, remanufacturing is defined as an industrial process that restores end-of-life
goods to original working condition or better in U.S. International Trade Commission. A
company that provides services for restoring a product to its original condition after use is called
a producer of remanufactured products [4]. Remanufactured products are typically sold at 30–
60% lower price, compared to new products, and the energy and resources are saved by 70–80%,
compared to new manufacturing [5, 6]. At the same time, the remanufacturing is estimated to
have the job creation effect three times more than general manufacturing [7, 8]. Furthermore, it
can be considered as a responding measure to the global circumstances following the greenhouse
effect, energy and resources issues, environmental regulations and economic recession. The
remanufacturing is now spreading out to various industrial sectors in the U.S. and Europe, such
as vehicle, electrical and electronics, aerospace, heavy duty and off-road (HDOR) and machinery,
and it considerably contributes to greenhouse gas reduction, resource saving and profit-making
[9–12]. The remanufacturing thus needs to be actively nurtured as one of the industries that bring
about advantages of saving cost for manufacturing, reducing waste and greenhouse gas emission,
and decreasing consumers’ expenses.
In order to foster the remanufacturing industry, the current status of the industry should be
well understood. The U.S. is the country that has the biggest remanufacturing industry with the
longest history in the world and has a variety of items for remanufacturing. It is said that 121
product items of the U.S. Standard Industrial Classification are remanufactured, for instance,
aircraft, medical devices, and military equipment, other than automotive parts and printer
cartridge [13]. The United States International Trade Commission (USITC) categorizes the
remanufacturing industry into major 12 industries, i.e., aerospace, consumer goods, electronics, heavy equipment, IT products, train, machinery, medical devices, automotive parts, office
furniture, restaurant instrument and tires. The commission collects the data on the U.S.
remanufacturing industry and its export/import and provides the data to the concerned parties.
According to the USITC, the remanufacturing market size of the U.S. in 2011 stood at 43
billion USD, increased approximately 15% from 37.3 billion USD of 2009 [4]. In Europe, the
data on the remanufacturing market is presented by the European Remanufacturing Network
(ERN) and there are nine industries, such as aerospace, vehicle, electronics, furniture, heavy
equipment, machinery, ship, medical device, and railway, and the market size for 27 European
countries in 2014 was estimated to be 33 billion USD [14]. In Japan, the items for
remanufacturing include automotive parts, photocopier, toner cartridge and tire while the
market size seems to be about 1444 million USD. The items from other industries, such as
medical device, industrial machinery, ICT device, and liquid crystal panel for cellular phone,
and office furniture and stationery, are also remanufactured in Japan [15–20]. However, it
seems to be relatively small in terms of the market size. In Korea, the industries of automotive
parts and toner cartridges are active in remanufacturing according to data from 2010 and the
market is considered to be 600 million USD in size [9]. Unfortunately, however, Korea’s
statistics on the remanufacturing industry is focused only on specific industry and the data is

Research methods
The remanufacturing business in Korea is active in automotive parts, cartridges, catalyst-coated
products, and electrical and electronic equipment. In this study, the remanufacturing enterprises
in these four industries were investigated on their revenue and employees in order to analyze the
current status of remanufacturing industry of Korea. The data was gathered based on the year of
2015. In order to understand the current status of companies, the literature review, on-line
research, telephone call research and on site field study were simultaneously implemented. The
procedures and details of the remanufacturing industry survey are shown in Fig. 1.
A survey of the automotive sector was conducted for general remanufacturers and automobile maintenance companies engaged in remanufacturing business. This fact survey excluded indirect associates with the remanufacturing industry, such as distributors, because only
those companies that produce remanufactured products were designed to be investigated.
National remanufacturing quality certification system, one of Korea’s remanufacturing related
systems, recently notified external parts such as bumpers, doors and fenders as items to be
remanufactured. Some automotive maintenance companies are equipped with facilities for
manufacturing automobile exterior products and are in the process of remanufacturing these
items. Most OEMs producing automotive parts in Korea were found not to produce
remanufactured automotive parts. We selected companies that only produce remanufactured
automotive parts as survey population. There are very few OEMs doing remanufacturing
business in Korea and the data is not reflected in this survey. In the case of toner cartridge, just
cartridge remanufacturing enterprises were counted while the distributors and raw material
suppliers were excluded (the distributors and raw material suppliers linked with the
remanufacturing of toner cartridge were excluded in this sector).

Regarding the study on the remanufacturing enterprises for catalyst-coated products, the
businesses that had records of delivering the remanufactured catalyst-coated products to power
plants or petro-chemical facilities were included.
In Korea, rental business is increasing mainly in household electrical and electronic
products, and it is producing remanufactured electric and electronic products by using afteruse products that are generated here as cores. Major electrical and electronic products that can
be remanufactured include air purifiers, water softeners, bidets, etc. We surveyed a company
that produce these products in the electric and electronic products sector.

Results
The results from survey on Korea’s remanufacturing industry showed that 7332 employees are
working at 1177 enterprises, forming the market size of 695 million USD (Table 1). The automotive
parts enterprises turned out to take up the largest portion of Korea’s remanufacturing industry, with
85% in the number of enterprises, 81% of market size, and 71% of employees.
The surveyed 1177 enterprises were classified into five groups according to the number of
their employees, i.e., enterprises less than 6 employees, 6 to 10 employees, 11 to 50
employees, 51 to 100 employees, and more than 100 employees, so that the size of the
employment of these enterprises would be studied. The result of the grouping is illustrated in
Fig. 2. The enterprises with 6 to 10 employees in the automotive parts remanufacturing took up
the largest portion with 55%, followed by the enterprises with less than 6 employees (40%). In
the cartridge remanufacturing, the enterprises with less than 6 employees took up the largest
portion (43%), followed by the enterprises with 6 to 10 employees (33%). It turned out that
most of automotive parts and cartridge remanufacturing companies, which take up 99% of the
entire remanufacturing industry of Korea, are small businesses with less than 10 employees.
On the other hand, most remanufacturers for catalyst-coated products and electrical and
electronic equipment have 11 to 50, or 51 to 100 employees. However, there are not so many
enterprises in these sectors.
The revenue of the automotive parts and cartridge remanufacturing enterprises, which take
up the largest portion of Korea’s remanufacturing industry, was divided by the groups based on
the number of employees. In case of the automotive parts remanufacturing, most businesses
have less than 10 employees and less than 2 million USD in revenue, as shown in (a) of Fig. 3.
In the case of cartridge remanufacturing, most businesses have less than 10 employees and less
than 1 million USD in revenue, as shown in (b) of Fig. 3.
As shown in Table 2, the average revenue per company, the average number of employees,
and the revenue per employee were calculated by each remanufacturing sector. It turned out

that the average revenue per company was 590 thousand USD, the average number of
employee was 6, and the revenue per employee was approximately 95 thousand USD in
Korea’s remanufacturing industry. The electrical and electronic remanufacturing has the
highest revenue, followed by catalyst-coated products, toner cartridges, and automotive parts
remanufacturing sectors. The catalyst-coated products remanufacturing business tends to have
the largest number of employees while the automotive parts remanufacturing business has the
lowest number with 5. The electrical and electronic equipment remanufacturing business has
the highest revenue per employee, 332 thousand USD, followed by automotive parts, toner
cartridges, and catalyst-coated products remanufacturing businesses.
The reason for the relatively high average revenue in the electrical and electronic equipment
remanufacturing business is that, as compared with remanufacturers in other fields, the
company we surveyed is a large-sized manufacturer that is originally an OEM and operates
a separate remanufacturing division. Average revenues in the electrical and electronic equipment sector include only revenues from the company’s remanufacturing business.

2010. The number of employees also decreased by 33% from 11,000 to 7332. However, the
market size increased by 16%, from 597 million USD (2010) to 695 million USD (2015). Over
the past 5 years, the size of the remanufacturing market has grown by 16.4%, but the number
of companies and the number of workers have declined somewhat.
The spread trend of the number of employees in the remanufacturing enterprises shows that
the number of companies with less than 6 employees and with 11 to 50 employees decreased
as seen in Fig. 4. It seems that the number decreased because the remanufacturing SMEs with
less than 6 employees were relatively less competitive and the restructuring and streamlining
of the SMEs due to the worsening of profitability. There were fewer than 10 companies with
more than 51 employees and only a few companies in every remanufacturing sector. Although
remanufacturers can show similar numbers of employees for each company, differences in the

level of production facilities, technological competence, and market competitiveness of each
company can result in differences in sales.
What needs to be highlighted in Korea’s remanufacturing market is that it had been only
focused on the fields of automotive parts and toner cartridges until recently. This means that it
has been operated in relatively quite narrow scope of industry fields compared to advanced
remanufacturing countries. Fortunately the remanufacturing market in Korea is lately being
stretched to other sectors such as catalyst-coated products, electrical and electronic equipment
and construction machineries.

Comparative study on Korea and other countries’ remanufacturing industries
In order to define the current status of Korea’s remanufacturing industry, the comparative study
on Korea and other countries’ remanufacturing industries was conducted. The result of this
comparative study is summarized in Table 4. The US remanufacturing industry trends were
compared by referring to the reports published by the USITC and other references [4, 12, 13].
The remanufacturing industry trends in Europe were explained with reference to the results of
our joint research on remanufacturing in Europe with the CRR (Center for Remanufacturing &
Reuse) and the “Remanufacturing Market Study” published by ERN [14, 21, 22]. We also
compared the results of our joint research with AIST on the status of remanufacturing industry
in Japan and various data such as JAPRA [15–19].The U.S., which has the longest history of
remanufacturing industry, has the largest market of 43 billion USD in size and Europe

including Germany and U.K. has the 34 billion USD market. In case of Japan, its
remanufacturing market scale is estimated to be 1.4 billion USD, based on the public data.
On the other hand, it was found that Korea has relatively small remanufacturing market with
695 million USD.
In the US, the aerospace sector accounts for 30% of the total remanufacturing market,
followed by HDOR products (7.7 billion USD, 18.07%), auto parts (6.2 billion USD, 18.07%)
and machinery (5.8 billion USD, 13.48%), respectively.
The size and field of European remanufacturing industry is close to that of the United
States, the world’s largest remanufacturing level. As a result of reviewing the market size of the
remanufacturing industry, the aviation sector accounted for the largest (12 billion USD,
30.52%), followed by automobile parts (8.8 billion USD, 22.57%), HDOR products (4.9
billion USD, 12.57% (11.28%), respectively.
The total market size of the Japanese remanufacturing industry was difficult to estimate
clearly due to the lack of official statistical data or estimates. The major remanufacturing
industries are automobile parts, copiers, cartridges, and tires, among which automobile parts
account for the largest portion at 9.25 million USD.
Compared with the US and Europe, which are leading the global remanufacturing industry,
many countries interested in remanufacturing, including Korea and Japan, are continuing
efforts to expand their remanufacturing fields and markets.
Since Japan has never conducted nationwide remanufacturing market research, the entire

89

Comparative study between countries with different population scales was conducted to
understand the remanufacturing market size per person and employment rate of
remanufacturing industry. This was conducted for economically active population aged over
15 [22–25]. The total population of 27 European countries, including the U.K., France, and
Italy, was applied to study European case. As a result, as Table 5 shows, the U.S. which has the
largest remanufacturing market, turned out to have the biggest market size per capita, 135
USD, followed by Germany (122 USD), France (74 USD), and U.K. (73 USD), and Italy (62
USD); the entire European market size per capita was 67 USD. The market size per capita of
Korea was 14 USD. In addition, the rate of population engaged in the remanufacturing
industry was 0.070% for the U.S. which is remarkably higher than other countries. When
the population was taken into account, the market size of Korea seemed to be the smallest.
This may be due to the lack of statistical data on the remanufacturing industry in Korea.
Meanwhile, the remanufacturing engagement rates are the ratio of persons engaged in
remanufacturing business among the economically active population aged 15 or older. The
Japanese remanufacturing industry situation presented in Table 4 shows only motor vehicle
parts and retreaded tires. As other remanufacturing sectors have not been identified due to the
lack of publicly available data, Japan’s data are not reflected in the comparison of the national
remanufacturing market sizes in Table 5.

Challenges and opportunities of remanufacturing industry
The South Korean government has been implementing the detail policies to promote the
remanufacturing industry since it prepared the basis for fostering remanufacturing industry
through the revision of Act on the promotion of the conversion into environment-friendly
industrial structure in 2005. The main support systems are to certify the quality of
remanufacturing parts (components) by national remanufacturing quality certification system
and to support the research and development (R&D). Those led to expansion of market and
increase of sales on remanufacturing industry than 2005. The initial remanufacturing industry
was centered on automotive parts and toner cartridges however it recently expanded to include
household appliances, chemical catalyst products, and machineries etc..
In order to revitalize the remanufacturing market, joint efforts between the public and the
private sector are needed. In the public sector, it is necessary to promote the use of
remanufactured products, support the national remanufacturing quality certification system,
promote public relations (PR), and support R&D for the development of remanufacturing

technologies. In the private sector, it is important to secure quality competitiveness and to
establish a reasonable distribution network for products that customers can trust. As a result,
each stakeholder will continue to play a role in each field and consumers will be able to create
new markets by trusting the quality of remanufactured products and increasing their use.

Conclusion
Current status of the remanufacturing industries of Korea were intensively investigated.
Furthermore, the comparative studies with leading countries in the field of remanufacturing
were also implemented. Based on this study, it turned out that Korea has the market of 695
million USD in scale, only in the sectors of automotive parts, toner cartridges, electrical and
electronic equipment, and catalyst-coated products. On the other hand, in the U.S. and Europe,
not only automotive parts, but a variety of industries, such as aerospace, electrical and
electronics, HDOR, machinery and medical devices, are active in remanufacturing. Compared
to other advanced countries such as the U.S. (43 billion USD market size of the
remanufacturing industry) and Europe (34 billion USD), Korea’s remanufacturing industry is
relatively small in size. Likewise, it was analyzed that the U.S. has the largest remanufacturing
market size per capita (135 USD) while Korea’s market size per capita stood at 14 USD,
approximately one-tenth of the U.S. Once the remanufacturing market had been limited only to
a few items such as automotive parts and toner cartridges, however, it has recently been
expanded to catalyst-coated products and electrical and electronic equipment. The
remanufacturing market size has also been increased by 16% for recent 5 years from 2010
to 2015. The data on the current status of Korea’s remanufacturing industry would be utilized
for further business planning by all involved parties in the remanufacturing market.
