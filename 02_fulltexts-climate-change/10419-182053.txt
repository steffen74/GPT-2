INTRODUCTION

The most challenging strategic issues that face
business organizations today are in the area of Supply

Chain (SC). SC is a network of suppliers, factories,
warehouses, and distribution centers through which
raw materials are procured, transformed, and
delivered to customers. The success of a SC depends
on the most basic decision of SC management, which
influences all other decision levels. The topic of
designing a SC is called supply chain network design
(SCND). According to Chopra and Meindl [10],
SCND problem comprises the decisions regarding the
number and location of production facilities, the
capacity of each facility, the assignment of each
market region to one or more
locations, and supplier selection for sub-assemblies,
components and materials. Extensive reviews
surveying various issues in this area are available, for
example, in [19]. Indeed, building a sustainable
supply chain nowadays has become the ultimate
objective of intelligent organizations, where the goal
is not only to minimize common costs, but also to
integrate multi-criteria in the SCND and to reduce
vulnerability due to uncertainty, by reducing possible
sources of losses [19, 30, 35].
In this paper, we deal with the design of a multicriteria SCN under uncertain environment in order to
satisfy customers and to respect environmental,
social, and economical requirements. We consider a
multi-criteria, multi-level, single product, uncertain
SC parameters and single period SCND problem. The
network has three levels: suppliers, production plants
and customers. We propose a new approach based on
evidence theory (ET), analytic hierarchy process
(AHP) and two-stage stochastic programming (TSSP)
to design a SCN under uncertainty. In this work, our
most significant contributions are the following:(i)
we integrate experts decisions uncertainty,
environmental, social and economical aspects in the
SCND problem using the BF-AHP method, (ii) we
apply the ET, which is a strong formalism in
modelling uncertainties, to define the most relevant
scenarios that can be used in the TSSP model. The set
of scenarios are mined from an expert opinion
database with evidential data mining, (iii) we conduct
a comprehensive set of numerical studies.
Consequently, we reach some useful managerial
insights.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In
section 2, we detail the literature review. In section 3,
the basics of ET are highlighted from the transferable
an analysis of the computational results. Finally,
conclusions are drawn and perspectives are discussed
in section 6.

LITERATURE REVIEW

The business environment under which a SCN
operates is unknown and critical parameters such as
customer demands, costs, quantities, and capacities
are uncertain. The importance of uncertainty in
SCND has encouraged researchers to handle
stochastic parameters in SC problems [9, 20, 49].
Various modelling approaches have been developed
to deal with this complex problems, such as
probability theory, fuzzy sets theory [51], possibility
theory [7, 50], and the evidence theory [37].
In the area of stochastic SCND problems, scenariobased approaches such as TSSP result in more
models [2, 4, 35, 42, 45, 46]. Generally, in these
studies, the first stage decisions belong to the
strategic decision level, and second stage decisions
are tactical and operational decisions are made. For
instance, Mir Hassani et al. [24] presented a TSSP
model to design a SCN with uncertain demand
scenarios. The first stage decisions concern the
location of plants and distribution centers and the
setting of their capacity levels. The second stage
decisions concern the optimization of production and
distribution quantities. Santoso et al. [35] proposed a
TSSP for a multi-product SCND problem including
suppliers, processing facilities, and warehouses. They
also proposed an algorithm for solving the problem
and they used it for two realistic SCD problems.
Azaron et al. [4] developed a multi-objective
stochastic programming approach for SCD under
uncertainty. They considered numerous uncertain
parameters such as: demands, supplies, processing,
transportation, and capacity modification costs. The
common points of these proposed approaches are: (i)
minimizing cost or maximizing profit as a single
objective is often the optimization focus. Literature
surveys conducted by Seuring et al. [36] and
Benjaafar et al. [5] have identified a growing need for
developing quantitative models, methods and
approaches in sustainable SCND, (ii) in most multiobjective SCND approaches, only demand is
considered as the uncertainty source [16], (iii) in
most SCND problems under uncertainty only a few
scenarios can be considered in the optimization
process due to the complexity of the problem.
Although in most practical situations, the number of
possible scenarios is large. According to [19] an
importance based sampling approach must be
developed to ensure that all important plausible facets
are covered in the small sample of scenarios selected.

In literature, existing analytic hierarchy process
approaches are applied to facilitate location
problems, where logistic actors are not considered in
the selection criteria [3, 44]. Tuzkaya et al. [43]
included qualitative and quantitative criteria
(benefits, opportunities, costs and risks), to assess
and to select undesirable facility locations. Kinra and
Kotzab [18] suggested a simple AHP model to
include constraints such as government regulations,
policy, infrastructural and political conditions, to find
the best location of an industrial park. Few papers
integrated ET in SC problems one of them is Wu and
Barnes [48], which used the ET for formulating
criteria to use in partner selection decisionmaking in
agile supply chains. Wu [48] proposed a supplier
selection in a fuzzy group setting involving decisions
balancing a number of conflicting criteria and
opinions from different experts. In addition, only a
few works got interested in integrating data mining
tools in the SC problems [8, 26] despite their various
applications [22]. Data mining techniques can be
used to improve strategic and operational planning
activities [25]. However, SC literature lacks works
that integrate imperfect data mining, which is an
appropriate tool in case of treating uncertain and
imprecise data. More especially, no evidential data
mining approach has been applied to SCND
problems.

THE EVIDENCE THEORY
1

The ET (also called Belief Function Theory (BFT))
was initiated by the work of Dempster [11] on
upper and lower probabilities. The development of
the theory formalism is owed to Shafer [37]. Shafer
has shown the benefits of ET to model uncertain
knowledge. In addition, it allows knowledge
combination obtained through various sources and
it offers more flexibility than the probabilistic
framework does. Shafer’s book [37] has been
followed by a large literature on interpretation,
application, and computation [15, 41]. For example,
Smets [39, 41] introduced a non probabilistic
interpretation of ET called Transferable Belief
Model (TBM). In the remainder, we build our
contribution based on the Transferable Belief Model
(TBM).
The Basic Belief Assignment (BBA) m is a function
defined on each subspace of the set of disjunctions
of 2Θ and taking values in [0, 1]. Θ is the of all
possible exclusive and exhaustive answers
(hypothesis) for the treated question and is called
frame of discernment. It does not only represent all the
confidence granted to each possible response for the
1

In this paper we conjugate the use of the two designations of the
theory. The belief function theory designation is associated to the
certitude. A BBA m is modelled as follows:
𝑚𝑚( 𝐴𝐴) = 1
(1)
�∑ 𝐴𝐴 ⊆ 𝛩𝛩
𝑚𝑚(∅) ≥ 0

Each hypothesis A having a belief value greater than

0 is called a focal element. m(∅) is called the
conflictual mass. A BBA is called normal whenever
the emptyset is not a focal element and this
corresponds to a closed world assumption [38],
otherwise it is said subnormal and it corresponds to
an open world assumption [41]. The closed world
assumption is the assumption that what is not
known to be true must be false. The Open World
Assumption is the opposite. For more details, an

3

example of BBA modelling is shown in Annex A
(Example 3).
When several information, modelled by BBAs, are
induced from different experts, a fusion process is
required. The ET proposes several operators of
combination. One of the most used is the
conjunctive rule of combination. This combination
operator is used when sources (i.e. experts) are
distinct and reliable. For two sources S1 and S2 having
respectively m1 and m2 as BBAs, the conjunctive rule
of combination is written as follows:

(2)
For an event

can be written as follows:

(3)

where
corresponds to the conflict mass and
highlights the degree of contradiction between the
combined sources (for further details the reader can
refer to Annex A, Example 4).
Decision functions allow the determination of the most
suitable hypothesis from a BBA for the treated
problem. In the TBM model, the pignistic level (i.e.,

decision level) allows to make decision from classical
probabilities. The pignistic probability [40], denoted
BetP , was introduced by Smets [40] within its TBM
model. Not only does it makes probability
transformation but it also takes into consideration the
composite nature of focal elements. Formally, BetP is
defined
as
follows:

(4)

An example of pignistic probability use is provided in
Example 5 in Annex A.
In the following, we introduce the TSSP
formulation to design a SCN answering a real-world
problem.

SOLUTION APPROACH

This section presents a real-world SCND problem.
The potential design of a supply chain being
considered by a textile company in France (Fig. 1) is
composed of suppliers, production centres, and
customers. Several criteria should be integrated into
the model, such as the total SC cost, jobless level, the
quality of the location and the environmental
aspect. These criteria may affect the selection of the
facility locations, which is important for making an
optimal decision. The company is only interested in
the SCND problem from the strategic point of view
and model it as a multi-level, single-product and

single-period problem. Accordingly, the modelling
assumptions are as follows:
1. production costs [35], transportation costs [4],
demands [29] and supplied quantities [35] are
uncertain parameters.
2. products are aggregated into a single product
shipped through the SC network in a unique longterm period
In the following, we detail the steps of our approach.
This approach, as illustrated in Fig. 2, has four steps.
The first step consists in storing the experts’
preferences over a set of criteria in order to process
them with BF-AHP. In fact, the second step is related
to the best locations selection i.e., where facilities can
be set-up respecting all criteria: environmental,
social, and economical criteria. The BF-AHP method
[14], classical AHP method is often criticized for its
use of an unbalanced scale of estimations and its

inability to adequately handle uncertainty and
imprecision associated with the mapping of the
decision maker’s perception to a crisp number. In

Figure 1: Supply Chain Network

addition, BF-AHP tolerates that an expert may be
uncertain about his level of preference due to
incomplete information or knowledge, inherent
complexity and uncertainty within the decision
environment. Therefore, BF-AHP is an interesting
approach to tackle uncertainty and imprecision within
the pair-wise comparison process, in particular, when
the decision maker’s judgements are represented as a
qualitative assessment. Once the best facilities are
located, in the third step, experts are questioned over
the optimal SCN configuration (called also scenarios)
to meet customer demand minimizing the sum of
costs. To select a subset of scenarios from a large set
given by experts, for solving the TSSP model, the
evidential data mining tools are used. Evidential data
mining is very suited to handle large uncertain data
and to associate a support value (degree of frequency
of an item within the database) to each selected
scenario. So, the last step combines ET and the TSSP
model. These steps will be detailed in the following
subsections.

Belief Function AHP
The introduction of the BFT to the AHP method has
brought flexibility in data treatment. Indeed,
imprecision and uncertainty are handled in the
decisionmaking problem. The first step of this method
consists in the identification of the set of criteria Ω
and alternatives Θ. The expert can not only express
his preferences on the selected criteria but he can also
do it on a set of them. Once the sets of criteria and
alternatives are defined, the expert tries to specify his
preferences in order to obtain the criterion weights and
the alternative scores in terms of each criterion.
Interested readers may refer to [13, 14] for more detail
of pair-wise comparisons and to preference elicitation.
At the alternative level, unlike the criterion level, the
expert tries to express his preferences over the sets
of alternatives regarding each criterion. Accordingly,
and to better imitate the expert reasoning, we
indicate that to define the influences of the criteria
on the evaluation of alternatives; we might use
conditional

that could be written as follows:
mΘ [cj ](Ak ) = ωk ,

∀Ak ⊂ 2Θ and cj ∈ Ω

where Ak represents a subset of 2Θ , ωk is the eigen
value of the kth sets of alternatives regarding the
criterion cj . mΘ [cj ](Ak ) means that we know the
belief about Ak regarding cj . The BF-AHP aims
through this step to combine the obtained
conditional belief with the importance of their
respective criteria to measure their contribution.
Since the group of criteria and alternative that
respectively belong to the frame of discernment Ω
and Θ are different, the extension for constructed
BBA is needed. At criterion level, the BBA mΩ

is extended to Θ× Ω with the use of Equation (21) 2.
On the other hand, at alternative level, the
ballooning extension [28] is applied with the use of
Equation (23) 3. The ballooning extension consists
at expressing a BBA, initially defined in the frame
of discernment Θ, in a higher set Θ × Ω. Finally, we
might combine the obtained BBA with the
importance of their respective criteria to measure
their contribution. To that purpose, we will apply the
conjunctive rule of combination so that:

is solved with the smaller set of scenarios in order to
obtain a representative solution in reasonable time. In
this subsection, we recall some basics of evidential
data mining.
An evidential database is a database in which expert
opinions are expressed with basic belief assignment
functions. Let us consider the set of n experts E =
{E1, · · · , En}. Each expert Ej gives his opinion with
regards to a parameter (e.g the cost) i ∈ I that takes its
value from the set Θi. The set
is all
I
possible choices (k ∈ [1, 2|Θi|]) that any expert i
and a parameter i, a BBA may pick for the parameter
BBA
i. For an expert Ej and a parameter i, a
is modelled as follows:

(7)
The constructed evidential database that summarizes
expert opinions is denoted EDB. A focal element is
commonly called an item. An itemset is a set of focal
elements belonging to different parameters. In this
work, an itemset having a size I (itemset containing
items from each parameter) represents a feasible
scenario.
Example 1 Table 1 shows an example of two experts
having their opinions captured in an evidential
database. The cost parameter takes its values
withinthe frame of discernment Θ1 = {High1, Low1}
whereas the quantity parameter are within
Θ2={High 2, Low2}. 𝑚𝑚 𝑖𝑖𝛩𝛩 ({𝑤𝑤𝑖𝑖𝑘𝑘 }) highlights how
k
confident expert j is that the parameter should be ωi .

Table 1: Supply chain parameter’s evidential database EDB

The first row of the database means the expert E1
thinks that the cost should have a high value but he
remains confused (m1Θ1 (Θ1) > 0). Expert E2 is sure
that the quantity should remain high (i.e, m2Θ2
({High2}) = 1). High 1 is an item whereas High1 ×
Low2 is a scenario.
Once the supply chain parameter’s evidential
database is constructed, the main task is to mine
interesting scenarios. As it is the case for the other
variant
of
data
mining,
the
aim

is to retrieve items and itemsets that have a degree
of presence (aka support) within the database
greater than or equal to a fixed threshold. In our
problem, it means that we are aiming at retrieving
valuable information supported by the majority of
experts. In this part, we introduce a new measure
that we denote as the precise measure. This measure
computes the pertinence of all scenarios. For an item
k
ω i , the precise measure is computed as follows:

(8)


As illustrated above, the Pr(.) is a measure that
computes the probability of presence of an item in a
single BBA. The Pr is also assimilated to the
k
pignistic probability in case of ω i ∈ Θi. For an
itemset
and satisfying the constraint

Finally, the support of X in the entire database is
deduced as follows:

Example 2 Let us consider the Table 1. The precise
measure of the scenarios X1={High c, Lowq } and X2 =
{High c, Highq } is computed as follows:

single expert Ej is computed with the precise measure
as follows:

The precise measure aims at estimating the
support of each itemset. In our problem, an
itemset is assimilated to a scenario. The more the
support grows for a scenario, the more priority it
1
gains. supported by the majority of experts. The
0
scenarios having the highest precise value (i.e.,
support) gather somehow the consensus of studied
experts. Therefore, the approach of extracting
pertinent scenarios with the precise measure is
denoted as Expert Decision Consensus Approach
(EDeCA). In addition, the precise support
provides very precise estimation of the support
comparatively to
the
other state-of-the-art
alternative which is the belief support [17]. As
demonstrated recently in [31, 34], the belief support
provides a pessimistic estimation of the support
and therefore do not outperform the precise
support.
In pattern mining the definition of support is related
to a threshold called minsup [1]. Let us assume a
threshold minsup and a scenario X, X is considered
as frequent as long as Pr EDB (X) ≥ minsup. The
threshold limits the number of retained scenarios.
Only scenarios with a support greater or equal to
minsup are retained in the set of frequent scenarios
FS. The threshold is generally fixed by the expert.
However, it still can be automatically computed to
select only pertinent scenarios [27]. In Example 2, for
a minsup fixed to 0.4, X2 is considered as a frequent
scenario.
Proposition 1 Let us consider the database EDB of n
experts expressing their opinions over I parameters.
Let us consider two scenarios X1 and X2. X1 has more

(11)

priority than X2 if and only if PrEDB (X1) > PrEDB
(X2).
Despite, the frequency threshold constraint, the
number of frequent scenarios could still be to great to
be evaluated. Therefore, several approaches for
selecting only the top-k best scenarios were provided
[47]. A top-k mining approach consists in retaining
only the k frequent scenarios with the highest utility.
In this work, we fix k parameter proportionally to the
𝑛𝑛∗500
� (five percent
size of the database such as 𝑘𝑘 = �
100
of the database). Therefore, the number of retrieved
pertinent scenario do never exceed 5% of the
database size. For the utility function, it is derived
from Proposition 1 where only those frequent
scenarios maximizing the support are retained.
Using the set of facility locations obtained solving the
belief AHP and the reduced set of scenarios along
with their precise measures obtained by solving
EDeCA approach, we design the supply chain
network of the problem solving the TSSP presented
in Equations (12) to (19).
We consider a network G=(NO, AC) (Fig. 1), where
NO is the set of nodes and AC is the set of arcs. The
SCN consists of the set of suppliers S, the set of
processing facilities Θ and the set of customers C. R
is the set of scenarios. The SC configuration
decisions consist in deciding which of the
manufacturing facilities to open and the quantity of
products transported through the SCN. We associate
a binary variable yi to the location decisions, yi=1, if
a manufacturing facility i is built, and 0 otherwise.
We let xij denote the flow of product from a node i to
denote the set of feasible solution of first-stage
decisions yi by Y . The uncertain parameter in this
formulation is: production costs, transportation costs,
opening costs, demands and supplies. The first stage
consists in determining the configuration decisions y,
and the second stage consists of the quantities of
goods to transport throughout the supply chain
network in an optimal way. Note that ξ represents the
random vector corresponding to the uncertain
parameters. The design objective is to minimize the
sum of investment costs and expected future variable
costs. The strategic SCN that we intend to establish,
should answer the following questions under
uncertain environment: (i) how many manufacturing
plants should be installed (ii) where the new sites
should be located

(iii) how much goods the production plant should
handle (iv) what products quantities to transport
throughout the supply chain network. The
minimization of the sum of investment can be written
as follows:
(12)

subject to:

𝑦𝑦 ∈ 𝑌𝑌 ⊆ {0, 1 𝑛𝑛 }

(13)

with Q(y, ξs) being the solution of the following
second stage problem:

(14)

subject to:
(15)

(16)

(17)

(18)

(19)

(20)

where oci denotes the opening cost for building
facility i, and ρs is the proba bility of each scenario.
The first-stage consists of configuration decisions y,
the objective is to minimize investment costs and
future operating costs (Equation 12). The secondstage consists of optimal production and
transportation of products through the SC based on
the configuration and the realized uncertain scenario
(Equation 14). fjs is the unit production cost of each
product at facility j and µs presents unit
transportation cost of each product and βij is the
distance between i and j on arc (ij). Constraint (15)
requires that the total flow of products from a
supplier j, should be less than the supply Aj at that
node. Constraint (16) enforces the flow conservation
of products across each processing node j. Constraint
(17) represents the capacity constraint who requires

that the total processing requirement of all products
flowing into a processing node j should be smaller
than the capacity Fjmax of facility j if it is built (yj=1).
If facility j is not built (yj=0) the constraint will force
all flow variables xij=0 for all i ∈ N . Constraint (18)
requires that the total flow of products sent to a
customer j should exceed the demand dk of customer
k. Finally, constraints (19) and (20) enforce the nonnegativity of the flow variables.

COMPUTATIONAL EXPERIMENTS

In this section, we present the results of the
analysis. In order to evaluate the model, we present
an example of SC. The SCN consists of 4 possible
company serves. We propose an ET-TSSP model in
which we involve 100 experts’ scenarios and 4
criteria: investment costs, environmental risks,
location, social aspect. The uncertain parameters
are: the experts decisions in the selection of the best
facility location set, customer demand, transportation
costs, production costs and supplied quantities. One
hundred scenarios are proposed by several experts
for TSSP and all these scenarios are reduced to 5
best scenarios using the evidential data mining tool.
The TSSP problem was solved using ILOG CPLEX
12.0 solver. All the experiments are conducted on a
PC with Intel Core 2 Duo 2.19 GHz and 2 GB RAM.

weights are then converted into a BBA mΩ.

A comparison between the deterministic approach
and the stochastic solution is performed next.
5.1 Belief AHP results
Before running the TSSP model, the first step is to
obtain a set of potential facility locations. As
mentioned in section 4, the potential set of facilities
needs to be computed using BF-AHP. To select the
best facility locations, we relied on four important
criteria: Ω={investment costs (C1), environmental
risks (C2), location (Accessibility, closeness to
suppliers and customers) (C3), social aspect (C4)}.
We have to select the best locations from four
location alternatives: Θ={L1, L2, L3, L4} as shown in

The results of the EDeCA approach are
illustrated in Table 9 and 10. EDeCA retrieved over
900 frequent scenarios from which we distinguish
two categories. The first category regroups over
500 imprecise scenarios which we denote as the
vague ones. Indeed, to each single parameter, the

(disjunction of hypothesis). These kinds of scenario
are important since it gives the decision maker an
idea about the values that he must avoid and those

are shown in Table 9 where k is fixed to 5. So, these
scenarios are then ranked by their pertinence. The
second category regroups the precise frequent
scenarios i.e., those constituted by simple focal
elements (singleton hypothesis). The precise

scenarios point out which parameter’s value the
decider has to choose. The top-5 precise scenarios
are shown in Table 10.

By comparing the pertinence in Table 9 and 10, we
notice that the vague scenarios present a better
pertinence than the precise ones. This result was to
be expected due to the nature of the pertinence
formula (Equation (11)) and its pignistic probability
basics. The more the considered scenario is vague, the
more pertinence it gathers. On the other hand, our
EDeCA approach gives a classification of both
scenario categories. Even if the pertinence of the
precise scenarios is low, EDeCA shows a ranked list
of the best scenarios to rely on.
5.3 Two-stage stochastic model results
In this step, we study the configuration of the supply
chain network. By using the set of facility locations
and the reduced set of scenarios obtained in the
preview step we solve the mathematical model (12)(19). The values for the SC uncertain parameters are
the same as in Table 10. In order to generate a
balanced network configuration between these various
scenarios, we applied stochastic programming with
equal probabilities. Table 11 summarizes the results of
the TSSP model, deterministic (DET), and normal
distribution model (NDM). TSSP solution is
obtained solving the TSSP model considering the 5
scenarios of EDeCA results and the best two facility
locations L1 and L3.
TSSP4 solution is obtained solving the TSSP model
considering the 5 scenarios of EDeCA results and the
four location alternatives: Θ = {L1, L2, L3, L4}.
A deterministic model is used to solve each scenario
individually (S1,..,S5). Scenarios (S6,..,S10) are
generated assuming that the uncertain parameters fit
to normal distribution.

Table 11 reveals that, for this case, the TSSP model
contains 148 variables and 235 constraints. As we can
see, for 5 scenarios the CPU Time is equal to 195
seconds, and it can easily go up with the growing of
scenario numbers and the size of the supply chain.
The SC configuration proposed is to open two
production plants L1 and L3. The affectation of
customers to each production facility is depicted in
Fig. 8. To satisfy customers demand the production
plant L1 should deliver products to 3 customers (C7,
C8, C9) and L3 should supply products to customers
(C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, C6, C10). The solution of TSSP4
is to open two production facilities L3 and L4. The
production plant L3 delivers the products to four
customers (C1, C2, C3, C5) and L4 supplies the
other customers. The best facilities selected in this
case are different than the facilities obtained solving
the BF-AHP, because only the economic aspect was
considered in the TSSP model. The solutions obtained
using the TSSP model are feasible only because of
the high capacity of the suppliers and the
nonconsideration of the capacity constraints.
Comparing the TSSP solution to the deterministic
ones the structure of the SCN is the same in the all
scenarios. This can be explained by the low
uncertainty of the SC parameters and the small size
of the case study. The NDM model exhibits two
different SCNs, for scenarios (S6,S7,S8,S9) the
optimal solution is to open two facilities L1 and L3
and for scenario S10, the SC configuration proposed

CONCLUSIONS

In this paper, we introduce a multi-criteria SCND
under uncertainty model based on the evidence
theory. The main contribution of the model is the
integration of multi-criteria aspect and uncertainty of
SC parameters in the design of SCN using the belief
AHP and TSSP.
The approach contains two steps, the aim of the first
step is to select the best locations where plants can be
opened. We used the belief AHP method to integrate
uncertain information given by experts and to
consider
many criteria
in the selection:
environmental, social, and economical. In the second
step, we consider that all SC parameters of the

model
are
uncertain:
transportation
costs,
production costs, customers demand and supplied
quantities. So, we used the evidential data mining to
select a subset of scenarios from a large set given by
experts and TSSP to model the problem.
Several possible future research avenues can be
defined in this context. For instance, addressing
uncertainty in the suppliers capacity, the production
capacity and the location of customers may be
attractive direction for future research. Also, testing
the approach on large scale SCN is not addressed in
this paper. Therefore the evaluation of the model on
large SCN and comparing its efficiency to other
methods can be an interesting development in this
area
