Background
Remanufacturing is an important component of a resource efficient manufacturing industry.
Remanufacture involves dismantling a product, restoration and replacement of components
and testing of the individual parts and the whole product to ensure that it is within its original
design specifications. The performance after remanufacture is expected to be the same as the
original performance specification and the remanufactured product generally offers a warranty.
By keeping components and their embodied material in use longer, significant environmental benefits can be realised. Less energy and material resources are used and less waste is
being created when the products and components are used again instead of only recycling the
materials. Remanufacturing also provides opportunities for the creation of highly skilled jobs
and economic growth. Despite these indeed positive features, remanufacturing is an
undervalued part of the industrial landscape and an under-recognised industry.
According to a recent study conducted by the European Remanufacturing Network– project
[1], remanufacturing in Europe is currently assessed to reach about 30 billion euros. As a
comparison, according to a USITC report [2] from 2012, USA is reported as the largest
remanufacturer in the world with the value about 43 billion dollars and a growing trend. In order
to accelerate the growth in European remanufacturing activities, the European Commission has
funded a project to form, coordinate and support a European Remanufacturing Network (ERN).
This Horizon 2020 project took place over a period of two years, with the ambition to:

&
&
&
&

Encourage new businesses to take up remanufacturing
Help existing remanufacturers improve their operations
Improve competitiveness of remanufacturers domestically and internationally
Create greater awareness of remanufacturing to increase demand and address barriers

Objectives
One key objective of the ERN project was to provide targeted recommendations to key actors,
such as policy makers, product designers and remanufacturing industries, to promote
remanufacturing. Specific tasks within this activity involved:

&

&

Consolidation of relevant information from the previous research on barriers for
remanufacturing and market knowledge. Translate the identified barriers and identified
knowledge gaps as well as development needed into targeted recommendations and future
European action planning.

161

This article describes the main recommendations and the process applied in the ERN
project to define them. The main content of the work described consists of analysing the
remanufacturing barriers and identifying measures to overcome them.

Research approach
The methodology for the definition of the recommendations and the action plan is described in
Fig. 1. In the used methodology the “The Voice of Industry” is emphasised. The industrial
voice comes from more than 600 people through several channels and activities performed in
the ERN project, including;

&
&
&

A Market Study based on an industrial questionnaire with more than 200 industrial
responders
Case Studies. More than 50 industrial companies where interviewed and visited.
Eight Industrial Workshops in different countries attracted more than 400 participants.

In the used methodology results from previous work in the ERN project were used. The basis
for the recommendations identification process is the objective and vision for remanufacturing
in Europe which has been set up in the market study performed by the ERN project. The ERN
results also included the analysis of remanufacturing business models, processes and design for
remanufacturing, using business cases from industry. Additionally literature regarding

remanufacturing and circular economy was studied. The main information sources are listed in
the next sections. The main approach in the identification of recommendations was to study
what are the current barriers and challenges of remanufacturing and to define the actions based
on them: How the barriers could be overcome, what development actions are needed.
It is also important to understand that in addition to companies active in remanufacturing,
other organizations and actors can contribute to the success of remanufacturing. Thus the
different stakeholders and key actors were identified.
The consolidation of barriers and recommendations from different sources resulted in two “long
lists“, one for the identified barriers and another for the identified recommendations. To make the
information more usable both of the long lists were analysed to structure them into three categories,
dividing the barriers and recommendations accordingly to the key topics of ERN project (business
models, design, and processes). Also the overlapping barriers and recommendations in each
category were aggregated together to a smaller number; thus making it more easy to assess them.
In each phase the intermediate results were given to the project consortium partners for
review, comments, corrections and additions. The final industrial assessment was performed as
part of an industrial workshop in Glasgow, September 2016. In the workshop the actions and
recommendations were also mapped to the barriers and the timeline and importance of the
actions were assessed by the workshop participants. Finally, for each recommendation the
targeted stakeholder was identified. In this phase it was found clearer to categorize the
recommendations for each stakeholder, instead of the original categorization according to
ERN topics. The reorganization also supports dissemination of the recommendations to the
target groups. Figure 1 illustrates the methodology for recommendations definition.
The used methodology contains the following steps:

&

Setting European industrial objectives for recommendations

The objectives were derived from the ERN project market study. The most ambitious
“Transformation” scenario was selected as the basis.

&

Identifying remanufacturing barriers, gaps, challenges and development needed.

The step involved the collection of information from literature and from previous ERN
results in the field of business models, processes and design. Industrial viewpoints were
included from case studies. The resulted “long list” of barriers was analysed, structured and
aggregated to the main barriers.

&

Identification of Key Actors and Stakeholders

The stakeholders which could contribute to the adoption of remanufacturing were identified
and the key actors were chosen. The recommendations are targeted to these key stakeholders.

&

Mapping and Industrial Assessment:

The recommendations were mapped to barriers. As a result the recommendations having the
highest impact and the barriers having insufficient recommendations were recognized. An
industrial workshop was arranged for additional barriers and recommendations. Remanufacturing
experts listed recommendations which they considered most important.
The prioritization coming from different assessment methods and sources was consolidated
to identify the most important recommendations. Additional recommendations for barriers
with missing recommendations were brought in by remanufacturing experts.

Results
Objectives and timeline
In the ERN Remanufacturing Future Market Report (ERN market report) the following
scenarios for remanufacturing in Europe in 2030 were defined:
Base case: assumes approximate current growth rates up to 2030 for the remanufacturing
intensive industry sectors. An increased understanding of remanufacturing value both
from manufacturers and from consumers supports continuing growth resisting some of
the downward pressure put on the wider manufacturing industry in Europe. This does not
incorporate any step-change in the remanufacturing industry, rather just positive organic
growth for the industry. Base Case scenario would yield a production value of €46 billion,
employing some 300,000 people and averting 11 million tonnes of carbon dioxide
equivalent. This is a little over a 50% increase in remanufacturing from today’s levels.
Stretch case: a scenario where the value of remanufacturing from the perspectives of
creating highly skill jobs and environmental benefits is well understood by policy makers,
industry and consumers alike. Remanufacturing is thus incorporated as an important
strategy within a wider circular economy. Appropriate policies and promotional activities
to foster growth in the remanufacturing industry are adopted resulting in a higher intensity
of remanufacturing as a proportion of manufacturing. The Stretch scenario yields more
than double today’s levels with a value of €73 billion, employing 450,000 and averting 16
million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent.
Transformation case: a scenario where remanufacturing becomes a key strategic pillar
for the EU, taking much of the investment and effort away from lower level waste
hierarchy activities (Recycle, Recovery and Disposal) and focus on remanufacturing and


increased intensity of remanufacturing as a proportion of manufacturing by 2030. In the
Transformation scenario by 2030, the value of European remanufacturing would be close
to €100 billion employing over half a million people and averting some 21 million tonnes
of carbon dioxide equivalent.
It is assessed that the Base scenario follows the current development, without any additional
actions. Thus the recommendations defined in the exercise described aim to exceed the base
scenario, up to the Stretch scenario or even the Transformation scenario. The period under
review extends to 2030.

Identifying remanufacturing barriers
Information sources
The identification of barriers for Remanufacturing started with the analysis of ERN Project
documentation [1], including market analysis and case studies. In the main ERN viewpoints
(business models, processes and design) the barriers from each of them were identified.
Remanufacturing challenges, obstacles and barriers were also collected from the presentations
and discussions in the industrial workshops conducted. In remanufacturing and circular
economy literature, there is an abundant supply of different types of remanufacturing challenges, obstacles and difficulties available. However, when collecting this type of information
from literature you soon realise that many of the identified barriers are of the same type, thus
overlapping to some degree. The sources [1, 3–6] have been used.

Industrial voice
The ERN Market Study was carried out as a questionnaire to industrial recipients, representing
companies with some link to remanufacturing. The answers were received from more than 200
industrial partners. The survey included the question: “How important are the following barriers for
remanufacturing to your company? (1=Not important, 4=Very important)”. Figure 2 shows the

165

seen that the core volume, availability and quality were found very or quite important for most of the
respondents. Also the customer recognition was seen as of high importance.

Identified unstructured remanufacturing barriers
Analysing the information sources from previous research and from ERN results generated an
unstructured list of almost 300 barriers which were partly overlapping and at different levels of
detail. The large number and different levels of expression made the list difficult to manage.
Thus the information had to be structured and reduced to a more manageable list. For the
purpose a categorization according to viewpoints used in ERN was applied, namely Business
Models, Design for Remanufacturing and Remanufacturing Process. The three categories
where further structured into subcategories. Table 1 shows the structuring scheme that was used.

Organizing barriers to structures
For the practical structuration, a MS Excel-tool ® was used to manage all the original
barriers, to keep up their sources and to perform the organizing into selected structures.
Mainly it was quite straightforward to place the barriers into the structure but in some
cases a barrier was set in two different groups. Details of the distribution of barriers can be
seen in Fig. 3 below. It should be noted that the numbers do not directly express the
importance of each barrier. Partly this is because the originally listed barriers were at
different levels of scope and detail. Also, for example the lower number of barriers for
Design for Remanufacturing (DfRem in the figure) is coming mainly from the novelty of
this subject. A reason why more product types are not remanufactured is that their design
does not facilitate remanufacturing [7]. In addition, the design problems are likely to be more severe for

independent remanufacturers that do not have the full product knowledge and needs to perform much
reverse engineering in order to understand how to perform a proper remanufacturing of the product.

Aggregation of barriers
After the barriers were put into their categories the number was reduced, by removing overlaps,
merging and reformulating barriers with nearly similar content. Some generalization was also made.
By doing this the reference to the original source was lost. After the aggregation process the nearly
300 barriers were transformed into a list of 74 structured remanufacturing barriers.

Identification of key actors and stakeholders
Remanufacturing requires many different competences and capabilities. Thus, collaboration between
different companies along the supply chain is typically needed to perform remanufacturing processes.
There are different collaboration forms, depending on the remanufacturing “network manager”
(OEM, contracted, independent), product type, location etc. To progress in remanufacturing, however,
not only the companies already active in manufacturing and remanufacturing are needed. The whole
product lifecycle should be involved, thus taking remanufacturing option into account in product
design, sales and lifecycle services (including end of life). By doing so, information about the product
being remanufactured can be shared instead of getting lost along the way and reverse engineered at
the remanufacturing stage, see [8]. The role of government regulation is often mentioned in Circular
economy literature, but also different types of support organizations (like industry associations,
research & education), even different communities can influence the future development.
In many business fields the role and activity of customers is increasing and companies need to be
more aware of customer needs and preferences. The customers may be either enterprises or
consumers. Perhaps remanufacturing could be increased through better customer awareness and

participation. The customers are strongly influenced by the general opinion at each point of time. This
should also be taken into account.
Four categories of Key Actors in remanufacturing were selected and agreed on in the ERN project.
The grouping presented in Table 2 was used. The main categories of Key Actors have been further
structured into more detailed subcategories.

Identified recommendations
For the first identification of unstructured recommendations for remanufacturing, an analogous
process as in the identification of barriers was used: first the “long list” of recommendations was
identified using different sources, then their categories were identified and finally they were aggregated into the categories according to ERN topics (business models, process, design).

Information sources
The ERN Project documentation has been used as the first sources of information. There is also a
wealth of literature on different recommendations for Remanufacturing and circular economy in
general. The sources [7–20] listed in the References section have been used.

Identified unstructured remanufacturing recommendations
Analysing information sources resulted in an unstructured list of 120 recommendations. As for
barriers, the information had to be structured and reduced to a more manageable list.

Structuration and aggregation
In the first phase the same structure scheme as for barriers was used, namely the categories; Business
Models, Design for remanufacturing and Process. In addition to the ERN three main structures, a
fourth category “Other” was added for recommendations that are more general or do not otherwise fit
within the ERN categories. Also the same methodology and tools as for barriers were used to
structure the recommendations. In some cases the text describing and motivating the recommendation
was quite long. A laborious task was undertaken to remove overlapping recommendations and to
aggregate and merge them into a more manageable list. During the aggregation process also each
recommendation was mapped to one or several actors. The list of key actors was used. After the
aggregation process a more manageable structured list of 67 recommendations for remanufacturing
was reached. Figure 4 shows the distribution of recommendations per Actor.

Organizing aggregated recommendation to structures
The MS Excel-tool ® as mentioned in “Identifying remanufacturing barriers” section was used to
analyse how the aggregated recommendations fall into the used structure (business model, processes
and design). Details of the distribution of recommendations can be seen in Fig. 5 below. Even if the
numbers indicate which areas have been highlighted in the source material, they do not directly tell
the importance of each aggregated recommendation. One reason is again the different level of scope
and detail of different recommendations.

Analysing aggregated recommendation and actors
A further analysis was conducted to check if a specific group of Actors can be seen as responsible for

169

category (Business Model, DfRem and Process). From the graph it can be seen that the actor group
Business Enterprises and Industries are seen as responsible for developing remanufacturing processes,
while Policy Makers are seen as responsible for developing the business opportunities for
remanufacturing. However the distinction is not very clear.

Mapping and industrial assessment of recommendations
Three different methods for selecting the most important recommendations were used.
1. Desktop analysis. Combining and cross checking recommendations and barriers.
2. Industrial assessment done in workshops
3. A collection of ERN expert opinions and ratings of the most important recommendations.
The ERN experts also contributed with their knowledge for additional recommendations
for barriers with missing recommendations.
As a final step the three approaches were combined to identify the main targeted
recommendations.

Desktop analysis
The result from Fig. 3 (number of barriers per ERN grouping category) and Fig. 6 (number of
recommendations per ERN grouping category) were compared. A fairy good correlation between the
two data sets could be noticed. The areas perceived as problematic, with many barriers, also received
attention in the form of a large number of recommendations. The conclusion is that the structure of
categories was well chosen.
A further analysis was done by mapping recommendations to barriers, which barrier is removed
with which recommendation or action. The analysis may give two kinds of useful information: 1)

which recommendations decrease or remove many different barriers? These actions may have high
impacts. 2) which barriers miss any recommendation/ action? What additional actions are needed and
could help?
Even after the structuring and aggregation the number of barriers (74) and recommendations (67)
was quite high to compare each individual recommendation to each barrier. Thus the first approach
was to perform the mapping inside the categories: business model, design and processes. This means
that the recommendations related to business models were compared with the barriers related to
business models, etc. Soon after starting the analysis it was found that this kind of analysis alone does
not give the correct view on the impact of the actions on the barriers. Clearly some recommendations
could affect different types of barriers. Thus it was decided not to restrict the desktop mapping inside
the categories but to cross check also between the other categories. In the analysis all the structured
recommendations were reviewed to identify the barriers they affect. As a whole, about 100 links were
identified of which about one fourth were across the three categories: for example, some recommendations relating to barriers related to business models also influence on barriers related to processes.
The graph in Fig. 7 shows the “top” recommendations based on number of linked barriers. This
means that each of these recommendations helps to overcome several barriers. The listed recommendations remove or decrease at least 3 different barriers.
Another objective was to identify barriers for which there were not sufficient recommendations.

remanufacturing. To tackle these barriers, ERN experts contributed with their knowledge for
additional recommendations for these barriers with missing recommendations. Thus, to remove
tensions and to improve collaboration between OEMs and third party remanufacturers, Business
Enterprises and Industries are recommended to collaborate in design, manufacturing and
remanufacturing to create sustainable solutions. To improve resources for remanufacturing, Educators
and Researchers should improve cross-disciplinary teaching and education for remanufacturing and
help business to incorporate remanufacturing. In addition, Business Enterprises and Industries should
stimulate investment in remanufacturing industry by promotion to third party investors. Unfortunately
no recommendations were found to ensure safety and security in remanufacturing, so this barrier
would need to be considered further in some other projects.

Industrial recommendations assessment workshop
An industrial workshop was arranged for the assessment purpose. It was attended by about 25
representatives from industry and research community. The participants were asked to review the
identified barriers and recommendations in groups of 4–5 persons. As a result the workshop
formulated, in all, ten new recommendations. In addition, each working group indicated the five
most important recommendations from the aggregated list of recommendations. The new recommendations were compared with the list of structured recommendations. A correspondence was
found for most of the given recommendations.

Expert opinions and ratings of the most important recommendations
The ERN experts were asked to select at most ten key recommendations to mitigate barriers for
remanufacturing in Europe. The partners were also asked to place the recommendation with the
highest priority at the top. The answers were collected from all partners. The following graph, Fig. 8,
shows the recommendations receiving the most attention (at least 3 persons have selected the
recommendation in their list of ten key representations). Additionally the graph shows the cumulative priority presented as the sum of the priorities given by partners. From the graph it can be
concluded that there is a fairly good correspondence between the number of supporting persons and
cumulative priority. The most important recommendation was found to be the removal of the

regulatory barriers to remanufacturing and in the next the focus was on teaching and education for
remanufacturing. Also international collaborative research for remanufacturing was seen important.
The ERN experts mainly come from research which influenced the high popularity of education and
research. On the other hand, in this prioritization, the recommendations targeted against industry
were not that visible.

Combining three approaches
The three approaches (desktop analysis of identifying and structuring the barriers and recommendations; industrial assessment done in the workshops; and the collection of ERN partners’ opinions)
were combined to finally select the most important recommendations. In order to combine the three
views the recommendations were put into a common table, Table 3. The table contains the
recommendations influencing at least three barriers, recommendations selected by the industrial
workshop and recommendations selected by at least three experts.
It can be seen that 5 recommendations were supported by all the 3 approaches: increasing
investment, promoting remanufacturing advantages, benefitting from integrated service offerings, improving cross-disciplinary education, and promoting products suitable for
remanufacturing. 8 recommendations were supported by 2 approaches: creating a certification
mark, mobilising supply chain communications, raising the policy profile of remanufacturing,
boosting international research and education, promoting leasing as an enabler, developing
extended producer responsibility, and directly assisting businesses to incorporate
remanufacturing.
It should be noted, though, that this list represents a mixture of issues, actions and potential
desired outcomes. The challenge is to unpick these into underlying issues which can then be
attributed with specific actions and – importantly – sponsors who will take up these actions,
believing them to be both practical and valuable. That is the subject of the next section.

Targeted recommendations
The previous sections have described the process of discovering and clustering the main
issues, concerns, desired outcomes and potential actions. In the definition of targeted
stakeholders for each recommendation it was identified that the previously used categorization (recommendations related to business models, processes, design) was not essential
from the stakeholder point of view. Thus to achieve a compact and understandable
presentation of recommendations the categorization was transformed to the targeted
stakeholder types (regulation, academy & research, industry, general public). Most of
the recommendations could be clearly targeted to a specific stakeholder group but some (like
increasing the awareness about remanufacturing) were related to several stakeholder types.
The analysis has tried to include the views of different practitioners in different sectors.
It is important to recognise that – because of the availability of representatives – not all
such views have necessarily been accommodated; and, even if they have been, there will
be notable differences in preference between independent remanufacturers and OEMs and
so on. In addition, the eventual end markets for remanufactured goods - be they business,

practicality, impact and potential attribution to specific actors who will own and execute them.
In the following sections, Tables 4, 5, 6, and 7, the targeted recommendations are listed briefly.
It is out of the scope of this paper to go into details regarding the recommendations, their
implementation timeframe and priorities. More details can be found in [1].

Recommendations for policymakers
The recommendations for policy makers (Table 4) aim to identify how policy could
support the enhancement of remanufacturing in Europe. In the background there are for
example the trade barriers which limit the potential for remanufacturing being able to
globally move goods when supply and demand are not in the same country. To progress in
this area, identification of the relevant regulation and how it could be modified, is needed.
Different means to support remanufacturing, like financial incentives and public procurement
can be used. The general shortage of awareness is proposed to be decreased by the clarification
of the definitions of waste and remanufacturing.

Recommendations for educators and researchers
Cross-disciplinary education about remanufacturing is needed (Table 5): not only technical
issues, but also design, process management (including reverse logistics) and business models
and management. Especially for the design new approaches and design tools are needed. Thus
collaborative, cross-disciplinary research is needed. The recommendation could be elicited
further to define a scheme for remanufacturing education and a roadmap for multi-disciplinary
remanufacturing research activities.

Action

Boost cross-disciplinary teaching and education in
remanufacturing.

Develop learning materials and tools to assist
current, growing remanufacturers and those
wishing to diversify into remanufacturing.

Increase research and international collaboration
to promote remanufacturing.
Develop an integrated set of design tools and
evaluation techniques that can support business
model, product and process design.

Recommendations for multi-stakeholders
One of the objectives of ERN project was to establish European network of actors in the
remanufacturing field to promote and collaborate in remanufacturing (Table 6).

Actions for business and industry
The business and industry constitute a group of different kinds of companies which can operate
in different roles in the remanufacturing network or companies that are not yet active in
remanufacturing. The group involves different types of remanufacturers: Original Equipment
Remanufacturers (OER), Contracted remanufacturers (CR) and Independent remanufacturers
(IR). Additionally companies are needed for remanufacturing specific service; cleaners,
disassemblers, testers, logistics providers; transport and storage, core dealers, brokers, collectors and sorters and maintenance partners and spare part providers, disassemblers and scrap
collectors. Also recycling companies and Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM) not yet
performing remanufacturing can be the target for industrial recommendations. The companies
may operate in different industrial fields and they may be of different sizes.
Thus, because of the high diversity, it is impossible to recommend very detailed and
specific actions for the industry, but they need to be given at a proportionally high level.
The suitability of each recommendation for a specific company depends largely on the
business situation, for example, if it is beneficial and potential to move from product offering
to service offering, thus allowing easier return of cores. On the other hand the recommendation

Action

Remanufacturers should consider integrated
product-service based offerings as an
alternative to make/sell models.
Design and promote products suitable for
remanufacturing.
Collaborate along the supply chain to create
sustainable product solutions.
Encourage measures which increase the
transparency and value of options
available to consumers, users etc. at end
of life to improve circularity.

relating to collaboration in the supply chain could be relevant to any company, even if the
collaboration could be different in different cases. Thus, as a conclusion, the recommendations
for industry (Table 7) can be seen as a generic advice. To build more specific guidelines the
generic recommendations should be analysed and turned to the situation of the specific
company. Performing this in a number of cases would further validate also the generic
recommendations.

Conclusions
In order to promote remanufacturing activities in Europe, the European Commission funded the
European Remanufacturing Network project. The project performed a market study in which the
proportion of manufactured output that achieves an extended life through remanufacturing
(remanufacturing intensity) was identified as a mere 2%. Also future scenarios by 2030 were
defined. The most ambitious transformation scenario foresees the potential to triple the volume of
remanufacturing in Europe until 2030 up to about 100 billion euros.
This paper aims to support the transformation scenario by defining recommendations
to overcome the remanufacturing barriers. The barriers for remanufacturing processes,
business models and design for remanufacturing were identified based on literature and
inclusion of industrial opinions. The recommendations to different stakeholders, including policy making, research & education and industry and general public, were correspondingly studied. The described analysis tried to be as inclusive as possible of the
views of different practitioners in different sectors. The analysis resulted in about 300
partly overlapping both for barriers and about 120 recommendations. Thus to report


makers, four for research & education, one multi-stakeholder recommendation and seven
main recommendations for business and industry.
As a result of the aggregation, some of the recommendations are still quite generic. Thus, to
implement them in the future they should be further analyzed and concretized. For example,
the regulations currently impeding remanufacturing should be further studied and the regulatory changes needed should be detailed. For remanufacturing education and research the
needed knowledge and curricula as well as a research roadmap should be further defined.
The suitability of the recommendations to industry should be analyzed and validated in
different sectors, company sizes and business environments and turned into more concrete
guidelines for specific types of companies or specific companies.
