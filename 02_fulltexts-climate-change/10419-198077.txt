1. THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU)5: A GLOBAL PLAYER IN PROMOTING
SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT6
‖While it faces considerable problems in making an effective response to its own
environmental deterioration, the EU has nevertheless developed an important leadership role in
global environmental politics and is an active participant in numerous international environmental
regulatory regimes‖ (Baker, 2000, p. 304). This is partly due to the fact that the EU environmental
policy has gained treaty recognition in 1986 with the adaptation of Single European Act (SEA).
Also, the capacity of EU to act internationally in global environmental politics is given by the

European Community (EC) is the legally correct term in reference to the EU‘s participation in international
environmental treaties. We prefer to use the term European Union (EU) throughout this article.

Sustainable development is a pattern of resource use that aims to meet human needs while preserving the environment
so that these needs can be met not only in the present, but also for future generations. The term was used by the
Brundtland Commission which coined what has become the most often-quoted definition of sustainable development as
development that "meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their
own needs." Retrieved Monday, May 3rd 2010 from: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_development . See also:

level to deal with regional or world-wide environmental problems‖(art. 130r (1) TEU). David
Pearce8 states that ―this extension of the sphere of influence reflected growing evidence that some
environmental problems could be tackled only at global level‖ (Pearce, 2001, p. 216).
With regard to sustainable development, it has long been one of the overarching objectives
of EU policy. Without defining the term, the Amsterdam Treaty of 1997 introduced the notion of
the achievement of sustainable development as one of tasks of the EU set out in Article 2. This
meant that the EU engaged itself with the idea of sustainable development. Furthermore, EU leaders
launched the first EU sustainable development strategy (EU SDS) in 2001 and updated it in 2006 to
tackle shortcomings and take account of new challenges. A set of sustainable development
indicators (SDIs) have been developed in order to establish whether the EU efficiently addresses
these challenges or not. The list of SDIs is available on the official page of Eurostat, which is also
responsible with publishing a progress report on the EU SDS every two years. The World Summit
on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg in 2002 marked ―another milestone in the
development of the EU role within the environmental sphere‖ (Lightfoot and Burchell, 2004, p.
337). The Review of the EU Sustainable Development Strategy (in 2009) underlines that in recent
years the EU has mainstreamed sustainable development into a broad range of its policies
(European Commission, 2009). It also stresses that one of the key challenges for sustainable
development, defined as ―economic and social development that is sustained through time‖ (Pearce,
2001, p. 231), in the EU is climate change.
As far as climate change is concerned, the 1992 Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit 9 resulted in
two major international environmental agreements10 to which the EU is signatory. One of them was
the United Nations Framework Convention11 on Climate Change (UN FCCC) which addressed
solving the issue of increased Earth surface temperature due to emission of greenhouse gases. This
document has been a controversial one, especially in the EU and the United States (US). ―The
source of controversy has not been science but the implications for environmental policy: it is
difficult to see how greenhouse gas emission reduction can be secured without raising the price of
energy significantly‖ (Pearce, 2001, p. 231). However, the EU, with a special status at UNCED, is

Change, which was the document that followed the UN FCCC. In the context of the Kyoto
Protocol, the EU has committed itself to jointly reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 8% (the
largest cut, greater than the 7% national reduction target of the US, which did not ratify the
Protocol) from 1990 levels by 2008-2012. That was possible because the EU had worked out a
common negotiation position with its Member States. Moreover, the EU is signatory to the UN
Montreal Protocol on Ozone Depletion.
All the above-mentioned documents are international multilateral agreements between
sovereign states. The EU is not a state. Nevertheless, being signatory to such agreements proves that
the EU ―has stepped up efforts to gain formal recognition as an international actor in environmental
policy‖ (Lenschow, 2005, p. 323) and that it has taken the lead in the fight against climate change
and the promotion of a low-carbon economy. Given this, the EU should be considered a global
player in promoting sustainable development.
This might explain why, behaving like a ―leading protagonist for a stringent international
regime, frequently holding out in negotiations against the US for higher targets for emission cuts‖
(Baker, 2000, p. 328), the EU is currently working for a global agreement. Such a global agreement
would help reduce global emissions of greenhouse gas beyond 2012, which is when the first
commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol ends. Moreover, this sort of agreement will facilitate the
introduction of a new financial architecture. For that matter, it should be legally binding.

2. THE 2009 UN CLIMATE CHANGE CONFERENCE AND THE COPENHAGEN
ACCORD

According to the Bali Road Map, a framework for climate change mitigation beyond 2012
was to be agreed at the 2009 UN Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen. The conference
included the 15th Conference of the Parties (COP 15) to the UN FCCC and the 5th Meeting of the
Parties (COP/MOP 5) to the Kyoto Protocol. It was described on the official website of the UN
FCCC as ―an exceptional event that attracted unprecedented participation and resulted in attendance
by 120 Heads of State and Government and raising climate discussions to a new level‖ 12.
It is important to notice that these Heads of State and Government (of developing and
developed countries) came with different expectations at the Copenhagen Summit. ―For the EU the
Copenhagen Summit was originally about the final sharing-out of the remaining carbon budget of

12

See: http://unfccc.int/meetings/cop_15/items/5257.php

until 2050. For many other countries, including industrialized ones, the Copenhagen Summit has
been more about architecture than about cuts in carbon emissions as such‖(Egenhofer and Georgiev,
2009).
When it comes to perspectives, those of developing countries differ from those of developed
countries. ―Developed countries are more concerned about global problems such as climate change,
while developing countries attach greater priority to rural issues such as desertification and soil
erosion and urban environmental issues such as water pollution and air quality in cities‖(Newell,
2005, pp. 222-223). Also, ―many developing countries have been critical of the way in which
certain issues (debt, terms of trade, regulation of multinational companies) have been actively kept
off the agenda of summits‖ (Newell, 2005, pp. 224-225). For the developing countries climate
change mitigation is ―a short-term ‗constraint on economic growth‘, mainly but not only because it
puts a constraint on the use of coal‖ (Egenhofer and Georgiev, 2009). For the industrialized
countries (including the EU) ―climate change mitigation is framed in the context of green growth
and jobs and future competitiveness‖ (Egenhofer and Georgiev, 2009). Moreover, developing
countries view developed countries as main, sometimes sole, producers of greenhouse gas and
expect the latter to make cuts in GHG emissions first. In the context of adaptation to climate
change, ―developing countries, especially least-developed countries, are more vulnerable as their
adaptive capacity tends to be lower than that of richer countries‖ (Egenhofer and Georgiev, 2009).
Apart from technologies for adaptation to climate change, ―for developing countries, one of the key
concerns has been the growth in environmental standards that many fear will be used as barriers to
trade and discussed forms of protectionism to protect Northern producers from competitive exports
from the South‖ (Newell, 2005, p.225). These expectations and perspectives might help explain
what happened at the Copenhagen Summit.
Shortly after the summit began, a draft document, the so-called ―Danish text‖, leaked.
According to John Vidal, in the Guardian, this draft agreement would have forced developing
countries to agree to specific emission cuts and measures that were not part of the original UN
agreement, further divide the category of developing countries by introducing the category of socalled ―most vulnerable‖ countries, weaken the UN role in handling climate finance by handing
effective control of climate change finance to the World Bank and not allow poor countries to emit
more than 1.44 tonnes of carbon per person by 2050, while allowing rich countries to emit 2.67
tonnes (Vidal, 2009). The ―Danish text‖ caused developing countries to react furiously. Their
protests lead to prolonged negotiations.

and the BASIC countries: China (as the world's biggest producer of carbon dioxide, the chief
greenhouse gas), India, South Africa and Brazil. This was done without democratically involving
other important parties to the UN FCCC (the EU) in the drafting process and in the final round of
negotiations. The result was a legally non-binding document, namely the Copenhagen Accord.
This document meant that developed countries, including the US, recognized the scientific
case for keeping the rise in global temperature to 2°C. Also, developed countries committed to
jointly mobilizing $100 billion annually by 2020 from both public and private sources and to
providing financial resources that would help developing countries (especially the least-developed
ones) to mitigate and adapt their technology to climate change. Moreover, the importance of carbon
markets, which are important for the EU environmental policy, has also been recognized.
Reactions to this document were diverse. ―Judging from the high rhetoric heard before the
Copenhagen meeting, urging parties to complete negotiations on a new international agreement on
climate change to follow the Kyoto Protocol, the results (the Copenhagen Accord) must be seen as a
failure‖(Egenhofer and Georgiev, 2009, p.3) or a ―disaster‖, according to the EU Swedish
Environment Minister Andreas Carlgren. Moderates described the outcome as ―neither earthshattering nor a failure‖ (Levi and Rubenstein, 2009) or as a foundation for global action, although
―there is much further to go‖ (US President-elect Barack Obama).
For us, the Copenhagen Accord is a curious case and proof that the EU is no longer the
leader of the fight against climate change. The EU has played a marginal role at the Copenhagen
Summit and so did the US. The Copenhagen Accord, which is yet to be adopted by UN FCCC
parties, is also a perfect example of a deadlock. China (a developing country) refused to agree with
the US nonnegotiable proviso: ―all other major nations would first be required to commit their
emissions reduction to a binding agreement and submit these reductions to ‗transparent verification‘
in greenhouse gas emissions data (Lee, 2009). The Chinese officials argued that such a degree of
transparency would be a violation of Chinese sovereignty and national interests, when in fact ―Wen
(Jiabao) would not want foreign experts reporting to political masters in America and Europe that
Beijing's capacity to compel local officials and locally managed, state-controlled enterprises-some
120,000 companies and countless other subsidiaries - to implement climate-change initiatives is
extremely poor‖ (Lee, 2009). Therefore, negotiations at the Copenhagen Summit focused on the US
and China trying to reach a legally binding agreement for fighting climate change. In order to seal a
deal that would have also helped passing new climate change legislation in the US, Barack Obama
accepted China‘s conditions. That may be why the Copenhagen Accord has also been described as
―probably the weakest compromise in the world‖ (Deutsche Bank, 2009).

the US played marginal roles during the Copenhagen Summit. This time developing countries
(Non-Annex I Parties13) were the ones to make their voices heard in UN climate change
negotiations. The only problem was that they did not speak with one voice: while the G4 group of
developing countries sided with the US in drafting the Copenhagen Accord, the G77 group of leastdeveloped countries protested vehemently against the former. As a result, on the 19 th of December,
COP only ―took note‖ of the Copenhagen Accord.

3. THE US RESPONSE TO CLIMATE CHANGE

In order to better understand why a legally binding agreement was not reached in
Copenhagen, we also need to explain the way in which sustainable development is perceived and
how the climate change issue is dealt with within the US.
With regard to sustainable development, ―like any other policy commitment, it ultimately
requires the support of (the US) Congress and strong, effective legislation. However, for the
Republican leaders in Congress, sustainable development is simply a problem for other countries to
worry about, particularly developing countries‖ (Bryner, 2000, p. 277).
As far as climate change is concerned, ―the US Congress joined the debate in July 1997
when the Senate unanimously passed a resolution (Senate Resolution 98 14) aimed at ensuring that
the US and other developed countries would not sign a climate change agreement that did not
impose on developing countries at least some (if not similar) commitments to reduce greenhouse
gas emissions‖ (Bryner, 2000, pp.291-292). This ―reply‖ to the Berlin Mandate15 specified that any
climate change treaty should include commitments for greenhouse gas reduction for developing
countries and should not result in serious harm to the US economy. ―Without binding commitments
from the developing countries industry representatives (in the US) charge that this will unfairly
advantage developing countries industries in global markets‖ (Bryner, 2000, p. 293). Also, during
the 90s, environmental ―agreements have either advantaged or imposed fewer burdens on European
producers compared to their American competitors. Hence the US has generally opposed these

The Berlin Mandate exempted non-Annex I countries (developing countries) from additional binding obligations, in
keeping with the principle of "common but differentiated responsibilities" established in the UNFCCC even though,

the EU, not the US, became a leader of the fight against climate change during the 90s.
At present, passing new climate change legislation16 that would show commitment of the US
to the idea of fighting climate change is a difficult process, given the lack of involvement from the
US Congress. Although the House of Representatives passed the climate change bill, climate
change legislation must also get through the Senate (Reuters, 2009). Otherwise, the result might
very well be another deadlock at the COP 16/COP 6 Conference in Mexico later this year.

4. THE COPENHAGEN ACCORD, A GLOBAL GREEN ECONOMY AND
GLOBAL GOVERNANCE

The Copenhagen Summit may have also been a first attempt to introduce a new economic
model, a global green economy17. As proof, in February 2010 Fox News revealed to the public a
leaked UNEP18 discussion paper 19 on the green economy which states that ―shifting towards a green
economy will also help to address challenges posed by climate change‖ 20. On the UNEP official
website of GEI21 we find that: ―UNEP has also been working with a large number of UN agencies
and other intergovernmental partners to harmonise green economy policy messages. For example,
in June 2009, UNEP, together with more than 20 UN agencies, the IMF 22 and the World Bank,
issued a joint statement 23, which noted that the current financial and economic crisis requires a
collective response from the global community that lays a solid foundation for shared growth and
sustainable development‖24. This statement concluded: ―The solidarity of the international
community is being tested. The most representative test case is when governments meet to seal the
deal on climate change in Copenhagen in December 2009. Let Copenhagen be the turning point for
ushering in a global green economy‖ 25. Could the possibility of UNEP introducing a new economic

―taking note‖ of a politically binding agreement?
What is even more curious is that a UN FCCC negotiating text26, a document which was
published before the Copenhagen Summit, stated that: ―The scheme for the new institutional
arrangement under the Convention will be based on three basic pillars: government; facilitative
mechanism; and financial mechanism, and the basic organization of which will include the
following: (a) The government will be ruled by the COP with the support of a new subsidiary body
on adaptation, and of an Executive Board responsible for the management of the new funds and the
related facilitative processes and bodies. The current Convention secretariat will operate as such, as
appropriate‖27. Was it the fear of countries signatories to the UN FCCC for losing their sovereignty
to an international COP-led government that prevented ―sealing of the deal‖?
There is also another explanation. Although developed countries have committed themselves
to providing financial resources to developing countries by means of a Copenhagen Green Climate
Fund, where such funding will come from is not specified in the Copenhagen Accord. The draft text
only mentions that ―this funding will come from a wide variety of sources, public and private,
bilateral and multilateral, including alternative sources of finance‖ 28. This vague statement might
give the opportunity to international financial institutions to undermine the UN FCCC. Both the
IMF and the World Bank have outlined and implemented climate change financing ideas. The IMF
proposed a ―Green Fund‖29, while the World Bank portfolio of climate investment funds consists of
the CTF30 and the SCF31. For the World Bank, financing will take the form of credit enhancement
and risk management tools, such as loans, grants, equity stakes, guarantees and other support
mobilised through donor contributions to the respective trust funds and implemented in
collaboration with the regional development banks (Tan, 2008).
At this point, we ask ourselves: ―what would happen if developing countries do not return
the loans awarded by the World Bank?‖ The term neocolonialism32 comes to mind. ―Africa today
pays more money every year in debt service payments to the IMF and World Bank than it receives
in loans from them, thereby often depriving the inhabitants of those countries from actual

Neocolonialism is a term used by post-colonial critics of developed countries' involvement in the developing world.

Plans upon these nations. Adjustments that largely consist of privatization programs which result in
deteriorating health, education, an inability to develop infrastructure, and in general, lower living
standards‖33. That may offer an explanation for the G77‘s protests.
Let us not forget about the ―curse‖ of the developing countries: natural resources, which are
described as ―gifts of nature‖ on the official page of the World Bank Group. It is important to notice
that international financial institutions may adopt ―a competing perspective that has long been
present in the study and practice of world politics which views natural resources as an instrument of
control and leverage over other states‖ (Hastedt and Knickrehm, 2003, p. 284). By ―natural
resources‖ we mean oil (the most important natural resource of the 70s, 80s and 90s), natural gas
and fresh water (the most important natural resources in the last decade), even forests and clean air
(probably the most important natural resources in decades to come). Bearing this in mind, the
reaction of the G77 group was justified.
Last, but not least, ―international financial institutions have directly promoted and financed
fossil fuel-intensive projects throughout the developing world; the immediate beneficiaries of the
World Bank‘s projects are G7-based corporations‖(Sobhani and Retallack, 2001, p.224). Also, ―by
building fossil fuel-based infrastructures so mindlessly throughout the world to meet the ever
growing energy-intensive needs of economic globalization and the development model it promotes,
the World Bank and the other multilateral development agencies are playing a leading role in
fuelling climate change‖ (Sobhani and Retallack, 2001, p.224).
All the above explanations may shed some light on the curious case of the Copenhagen
Accord.

5. CONCLUSIONS

The expectations for the 2009 UN FCCC Conference were not reached. The Copenhagen
Summit has been an attempt of introducing a legal framework for a new economic model, the green
economy, and a new institutional arrangement. Negotiations for a legally binding agreement for
climate change mitigation have been deadlocked. Not being involved in the drafting process of the
Copenhagen Accord and thus not being able make its voice heard, the EU has currently lost its
leader status in the fight against climate change. The result of the Copenhagen Summit, the

1. THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU)5: A GLOBAL PLAYER IN PROMOTING
SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT6
‖While it faces considerable problems in making an effective response to its own
environmental deterioration, the EU has nevertheless developed an important leadership role in
global environmental politics and is an active participant in numerous international environmental
regulatory regimes‖ (Baker, 2000, p. 304). This is partly due to the fact that the EU environmental
policy has gained treaty recognition in 1986 with the adaptation of Single European Act (SEA).
Also, the capacity of EU to act internationally in global environmental politics is given by the

European Community (EC) is the legally correct term in reference to the EU‘s participation in international
environmental treaties. We prefer to use the term European Union (EU) throughout this article.

Sustainable development is a pattern of resource use that aims to meet human needs while preserving the environment
so that these needs can be met not only in the present, but also for future generations. The term was used by the
Brundtland Commission which coined what has become the most often-quoted definition of sustainable development as
development that "meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their
own needs." Retrieved Monday, May 3rd 2010 from: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_development . See also:

level to deal with regional or world-wide environmental problems‖(art. 130r (1) TEU). David
Pearce8 states that ―this extension of the sphere of influence reflected growing evidence that some
environmental problems could be tackled only at global level‖ (Pearce, 2001, p. 216).
With regard to sustainable development, it has long been one of the overarching objectives
of EU policy. Without defining the term, the Amsterdam Treaty of 1997 introduced the notion of
the achievement of sustainable development as one of tasks of the EU set out in Article 2. This
meant that the EU engaged itself with the idea of sustainable development. Furthermore, EU leaders
launched the first EU sustainable development strategy (EU SDS) in 2001 and updated it in 2006 to
tackle shortcomings and take account of new challenges. A set of sustainable development
indicators (SDIs) have been developed in order to establish whether the EU efficiently addresses
these challenges or not. The list of SDIs is available on the official page of Eurostat, which is also
responsible with publishing a progress report on the EU SDS every two years. The World Summit
on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg in 2002 marked ―another milestone in the
development of the EU role within the environmental sphere‖ (Lightfoot and Burchell, 2004, p.
337). The Review of the EU Sustainable Development Strategy (in 2009) underlines that in recent
years the EU has mainstreamed sustainable development into a broad range of its policies
(European Commission, 2009). It also stresses that one of the key challenges for sustainable
development, defined as ―economic and social development that is sustained through time‖ (Pearce,
2001, p. 231), in the EU is climate change.
As far as climate change is concerned, the 1992 Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit 9 resulted in
two major international environmental agreements10 to which the EU is signatory. One of them was
the United Nations Framework Convention11 on Climate Change (UN FCCC) which addressed
solving the issue of increased Earth surface temperature due to emission of greenhouse gases. This
document has been a controversial one, especially in the EU and the United States (US). ―The
source of controversy has not been science but the implications for environmental policy: it is
difficult to see how greenhouse gas emission reduction can be secured without raising the price of
energy significantly‖ (Pearce, 2001, p. 231). However, the EU, with a special status at UNCED, is

Change, which was the document that followed the UN FCCC. In the context of the Kyoto
Protocol, the EU has committed itself to jointly reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 8% (the
largest cut, greater than the 7% national reduction target of the US, which did not ratify the
Protocol) from 1990 levels by 2008-2012. That was possible because the EU had worked out a
common negotiation position with its Member States. Moreover, the EU is signatory to the UN
Montreal Protocol on Ozone Depletion.
All the above-mentioned documents are international multilateral agreements between
sovereign states. The EU is not a state. Nevertheless, being signatory to such agreements proves that
the EU ―has stepped up efforts to gain formal recognition as an international actor in environmental
policy‖ (Lenschow, 2005, p. 323) and that it has taken the lead in the fight against climate change
and the promotion of a low-carbon economy. Given this, the EU should be considered a global
player in promoting sustainable development.
This might explain why, behaving like a ―leading protagonist for a stringent international
regime, frequently holding out in negotiations against the US for higher targets for emission cuts‖
(Baker, 2000, p. 328), the EU is currently working for a global agreement. Such a global agreement
would help reduce global emissions of greenhouse gas beyond 2012, which is when the first
commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol ends. Moreover, this sort of agreement will facilitate the
introduction of a new financial architecture. For that matter, it should be legally binding.

2. THE 2009 UN CLIMATE CHANGE CONFERENCE AND THE COPENHAGEN
ACCORD

According to the Bali Road Map, a framework for climate change mitigation beyond 2012
was to be agreed at the 2009 UN Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen. The conference
included the 15th Conference of the Parties (COP 15) to the UN FCCC and the 5th Meeting of the
Parties (COP/MOP 5) to the Kyoto Protocol. It was described on the official website of the UN
FCCC as ―an exceptional event that attracted unprecedented participation and resulted in attendance
by 120 Heads of State and Government and raising climate discussions to a new level‖ 12.
It is important to notice that these Heads of State and Government (of developing and
developed countries) came with different expectations at the Copenhagen Summit. ―For the EU the
Copenhagen Summit was originally about the final sharing-out of the remaining carbon budget of

12

See: http://unfccc.int/meetings/cop_15/items/5257.php

until 2050. For many other countries, including industrialized ones, the Copenhagen Summit has
been more about architecture than about cuts in carbon emissions as such‖(Egenhofer and Georgiev,
2009).
When it comes to perspectives, those of developing countries differ from those of developed
countries. ―Developed countries are more concerned about global problems such as climate change,
while developing countries attach greater priority to rural issues such as desertification and soil
erosion and urban environmental issues such as water pollution and air quality in cities‖(Newell,
2005, pp. 222-223). Also, ―many developing countries have been critical of the way in which
certain issues (debt, terms of trade, regulation of multinational companies) have been actively kept
off the agenda of summits‖ (Newell, 2005, pp. 224-225). For the developing countries climate
change mitigation is ―a short-term ‗constraint on economic growth‘, mainly but not only because it
puts a constraint on the use of coal‖ (Egenhofer and Georgiev, 2009). For the industrialized
countries (including the EU) ―climate change mitigation is framed in the context of green growth
and jobs and future competitiveness‖ (Egenhofer and Georgiev, 2009). Moreover, developing
countries view developed countries as main, sometimes sole, producers of greenhouse gas and
expect the latter to make cuts in GHG emissions first. In the context of adaptation to climate
change, ―developing countries, especially least-developed countries, are more vulnerable as their
adaptive capacity tends to be lower than that of richer countries‖ (Egenhofer and Georgiev, 2009).
Apart from technologies for adaptation to climate change, ―for developing countries, one of the key
concerns has been the growth in environmental standards that many fear will be used as barriers to
trade and discussed forms of protectionism to protect Northern producers from competitive exports
from the South‖ (Newell, 2005, p.225). These expectations and perspectives might help explain
what happened at the Copenhagen Summit.
Shortly after the summit began, a draft document, the so-called ―Danish text‖, leaked.
According to John Vidal, in the Guardian, this draft agreement would have forced developing
countries to agree to specific emission cuts and measures that were not part of the original UN
agreement, further divide the category of developing countries by introducing the category of socalled ―most vulnerable‖ countries, weaken the UN role in handling climate finance by handing
effective control of climate change finance to the World Bank and not allow poor countries to emit
more than 1.44 tonnes of carbon per person by 2050, while allowing rich countries to emit 2.67
tonnes (Vidal, 2009). The ―Danish text‖ caused developing countries to react furiously. Their
protests lead to prolonged negotiations.

and the BASIC countries: China (as the world's biggest producer of carbon dioxide, the chief
greenhouse gas), India, South Africa and Brazil. This was done without democratically involving
other important parties to the UN FCCC (the EU) in the drafting process and in the final round of
negotiations. The result was a legally non-binding document, namely the Copenhagen Accord.
This document meant that developed countries, including the US, recognized the scientific
case for keeping the rise in global temperature to 2°C. Also, developed countries committed to
jointly mobilizing $100 billion annually by 2020 from both public and private sources and to
providing financial resources that would help developing countries (especially the least-developed
ones) to mitigate and adapt their technology to climate change. Moreover, the importance of carbon
markets, which are important for the EU environmental policy, has also been recognized.
Reactions to this document were diverse. ―Judging from the high rhetoric heard before the
Copenhagen meeting, urging parties to complete negotiations on a new international agreement on
climate change to follow the Kyoto Protocol, the results (the Copenhagen Accord) must be seen as a
failure‖(Egenhofer and Georgiev, 2009, p.3) or a ―disaster‖, according to the EU Swedish
Environment Minister Andreas Carlgren. Moderates described the outcome as ―neither earthshattering nor a failure‖ (Levi and Rubenstein, 2009) or as a foundation for global action, although
―there is much further to go‖ (US President-elect Barack Obama).
For us, the Copenhagen Accord is a curious case and proof that the EU is no longer the
leader of the fight against climate change. The EU has played a marginal role at the Copenhagen
Summit and so did the US. The Copenhagen Accord, which is yet to be adopted by UN FCCC
parties, is also a perfect example of a deadlock. China (a developing country) refused to agree with
the US nonnegotiable proviso: ―all other major nations would first be required to commit their
emissions reduction to a binding agreement and submit these reductions to ‗transparent verification‘
in greenhouse gas emissions data (Lee, 2009). The Chinese officials argued that such a degree of
transparency would be a violation of Chinese sovereignty and national interests, when in fact ―Wen
(Jiabao) would not want foreign experts reporting to political masters in America and Europe that
Beijing's capacity to compel local officials and locally managed, state-controlled enterprises-some
120,000 companies and countless other subsidiaries - to implement climate-change initiatives is
extremely poor‖ (Lee, 2009). Therefore, negotiations at the Copenhagen Summit focused on the US
and China trying to reach a legally binding agreement for fighting climate change. In order to seal a
deal that would have also helped passing new climate change legislation in the US, Barack Obama
accepted China‘s conditions. That may be why the Copenhagen Accord has also been described as
―probably the weakest compromise in the world‖ (Deutsche Bank, 2009).

the US played marginal roles during the Copenhagen Summit. This time developing countries
(Non-Annex I Parties13) were the ones to make their voices heard in UN climate change
negotiations. The only problem was that they did not speak with one voice: while the G4 group of
developing countries sided with the US in drafting the Copenhagen Accord, the G77 group of leastdeveloped countries protested vehemently against the former. As a result, on the 19 th of December,
COP only ―took note‖ of the Copenhagen Accord.

3. THE US RESPONSE TO CLIMATE CHANGE

In order to better understand why a legally binding agreement was not reached in
Copenhagen, we also need to explain the way in which sustainable development is perceived and
how the climate change issue is dealt with within the US.
With regard to sustainable development, ―like any other policy commitment, it ultimately
requires the support of (the US) Congress and strong, effective legislation. However, for the
Republican leaders in Congress, sustainable development is simply a problem for other countries to
worry about, particularly developing countries‖ (Bryner, 2000, p. 277).
As far as climate change is concerned, ―the US Congress joined the debate in July 1997
when the Senate unanimously passed a resolution (Senate Resolution 98 14) aimed at ensuring that
the US and other developed countries would not sign a climate change agreement that did not
impose on developing countries at least some (if not similar) commitments to reduce greenhouse
gas emissions‖ (Bryner, 2000, pp.291-292). This ―reply‖ to the Berlin Mandate15 specified that any
climate change treaty should include commitments for greenhouse gas reduction for developing
countries and should not result in serious harm to the US economy. ―Without binding commitments
from the developing countries industry representatives (in the US) charge that this will unfairly
advantage developing countries industries in global markets‖ (Bryner, 2000, p. 293). Also, during
the 90s, environmental ―agreements have either advantaged or imposed fewer burdens on European
producers compared to their American competitors. Hence the US has generally opposed these

The Berlin Mandate exempted non-Annex I countries (developing countries) from additional binding obligations, in
keeping with the principle of "common but differentiated responsibilities" established in the UNFCCC even though,

the EU, not the US, became a leader of the fight against climate change during the 90s.
At present, passing new climate change legislation16 that would show commitment of the US
to the idea of fighting climate change is a difficult process, given the lack of involvement from the
US Congress. Although the House of Representatives passed the climate change bill, climate
change legislation must also get through the Senate (Reuters, 2009). Otherwise, the result might
very well be another deadlock at the COP 16/COP 6 Conference in Mexico later this year.

4. THE COPENHAGEN ACCORD, A GLOBAL GREEN ECONOMY AND
GLOBAL GOVERNANCE

The Copenhagen Summit may have also been a first attempt to introduce a new economic
model, a global green economy17. As proof, in February 2010 Fox News revealed to the public a
leaked UNEP18 discussion paper 19 on the green economy which states that ―shifting towards a green
economy will also help to address challenges posed by climate change‖ 20. On the UNEP official
website of GEI21 we find that: ―UNEP has also been working with a large number of UN agencies
and other intergovernmental partners to harmonise green economy policy messages. For example,
in June 2009, UNEP, together with more than 20 UN agencies, the IMF 22 and the World Bank,
issued a joint statement 23, which noted that the current financial and economic crisis requires a
collective response from the global community that lays a solid foundation for shared growth and
sustainable development‖24. This statement concluded: ―The solidarity of the international
community is being tested. The most representative test case is when governments meet to seal the
deal on climate change in Copenhagen in December 2009. Let Copenhagen be the turning point for
ushering in a global green economy‖ 25. Could the possibility of UNEP introducing a new economic

―taking note‖ of a politically binding agreement?
What is even more curious is that a UN FCCC negotiating text26, a document which was
published before the Copenhagen Summit, stated that: ―The scheme for the new institutional
arrangement under the Convention will be based on three basic pillars: government; facilitative
mechanism; and financial mechanism, and the basic organization of which will include the
following: (a) The government will be ruled by the COP with the support of a new subsidiary body
on adaptation, and of an Executive Board responsible for the management of the new funds and the
related facilitative processes and bodies. The current Convention secretariat will operate as such, as
appropriate‖27. Was it the fear of countries signatories to the UN FCCC for losing their sovereignty
to an international COP-led government that prevented ―sealing of the deal‖?
There is also another explanation. Although developed countries have committed themselves
to providing financial resources to developing countries by means of a Copenhagen Green Climate
Fund, where such funding will come from is not specified in the Copenhagen Accord. The draft text
only mentions that ―this funding will come from a wide variety of sources, public and private,
bilateral and multilateral, including alternative sources of finance‖ 28. This vague statement might
give the opportunity to international financial institutions to undermine the UN FCCC. Both the
IMF and the World Bank have outlined and implemented climate change financing ideas. The IMF
proposed a ―Green Fund‖29, while the World Bank portfolio of climate investment funds consists of
the CTF30 and the SCF31. For the World Bank, financing will take the form of credit enhancement
and risk management tools, such as loans, grants, equity stakes, guarantees and other support
mobilised through donor contributions to the respective trust funds and implemented in
collaboration with the regional development banks (Tan, 2008).
At this point, we ask ourselves: ―what would happen if developing countries do not return
the loans awarded by the World Bank?‖ The term neocolonialism32 comes to mind. ―Africa today
pays more money every year in debt service payments to the IMF and World Bank than it receives
in loans from them, thereby often depriving the inhabitants of those countries from actual

Neocolonialism is a term used by post-colonial critics of developed countries' involvement in the developing world.

Plans upon these nations. Adjustments that largely consist of privatization programs which result in
deteriorating health, education, an inability to develop infrastructure, and in general, lower living
standards‖33. That may offer an explanation for the G77‘s protests.
Let us not forget about the ―curse‖ of the developing countries: natural resources, which are
described as ―gifts of nature‖ on the official page of the World Bank Group. It is important to notice
that international financial institutions may adopt ―a competing perspective that has long been
present in the study and practice of world politics which views natural resources as an instrument of
control and leverage over other states‖ (Hastedt and Knickrehm, 2003, p. 284). By ―natural
resources‖ we mean oil (the most important natural resource of the 70s, 80s and 90s), natural gas
and fresh water (the most important natural resources in the last decade), even forests and clean air
(probably the most important natural resources in decades to come). Bearing this in mind, the
reaction of the G77 group was justified.
Last, but not least, ―international financial institutions have directly promoted and financed
fossil fuel-intensive projects throughout the developing world; the immediate beneficiaries of the
World Bank‘s projects are G7-based corporations‖(Sobhani and Retallack, 2001, p.224). Also, ―by
building fossil fuel-based infrastructures so mindlessly throughout the world to meet the ever
growing energy-intensive needs of economic globalization and the development model it promotes,
the World Bank and the other multilateral development agencies are playing a leading role in
fuelling climate change‖ (Sobhani and Retallack, 2001, p.224).
All the above explanations may shed some light on the curious case of the Copenhagen
Accord.

5. CONCLUSIONS

The expectations for the 2009 UN FCCC Conference were not reached. The Copenhagen
Summit has been an attempt of introducing a legal framework for a new economic model, the green
economy, and a new institutional arrangement. Negotiations for a legally binding agreement for
climate change mitigation have been deadlocked. Not being involved in the drafting process of the
Copenhagen Accord and thus not being able make its voice heard, the EU has currently lost its
leader status in the fight against climate change. The result of the Copenhagen Summit, the

1. THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU)5: A GLOBAL PLAYER IN PROMOTING
SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT6
‖While it faces considerable problems in making an effective response to its own
environmental deterioration, the EU has nevertheless developed an important leadership role in
global environmental politics and is an active participant in numerous international environmental
regulatory regimes‖ (Baker, 2000, p. 304). This is partly due to the fact that the EU environmental
policy has gained treaty recognition in 1986 with the adaptation of Single European Act (SEA).
Also, the capacity of EU to act internationally in global environmental politics is given by the

European Community (EC) is the legally correct term in reference to the EU‘s participation in international
environmental treaties. We prefer to use the term European Union (EU) throughout this article.

Sustainable development is a pattern of resource use that aims to meet human needs while preserving the environment
so that these needs can be met not only in the present, but also for future generations. The term was used by the
Brundtland Commission which coined what has become the most often-quoted definition of sustainable development as
development that "meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their
own needs." Retrieved Monday, May 3rd 2010 from: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sustainable_development . See also:

level to deal with regional or world-wide environmental problems‖(art. 130r (1) TEU). David
Pearce8 states that ―this extension of the sphere of influence reflected growing evidence that some
environmental problems could be tackled only at global level‖ (Pearce, 2001, p. 216).
With regard to sustainable development, it has long been one of the overarching objectives
of EU policy. Without defining the term, the Amsterdam Treaty of 1997 introduced the notion of
the achievement of sustainable development as one of tasks of the EU set out in Article 2. This
meant that the EU engaged itself with the idea of sustainable development. Furthermore, EU leaders
launched the first EU sustainable development strategy (EU SDS) in 2001 and updated it in 2006 to
tackle shortcomings and take account of new challenges. A set of sustainable development
indicators (SDIs) have been developed in order to establish whether the EU efficiently addresses
these challenges or not. The list of SDIs is available on the official page of Eurostat, which is also
responsible with publishing a progress report on the EU SDS every two years. The World Summit
on Sustainable Development in Johannesburg in 2002 marked ―another milestone in the
development of the EU role within the environmental sphere‖ (Lightfoot and Burchell, 2004, p.
337). The Review of the EU Sustainable Development Strategy (in 2009) underlines that in recent
years the EU has mainstreamed sustainable development into a broad range of its policies
(European Commission, 2009). It also stresses that one of the key challenges for sustainable
development, defined as ―economic and social development that is sustained through time‖ (Pearce,
2001, p. 231), in the EU is climate change.
As far as climate change is concerned, the 1992 Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit 9 resulted in
two major international environmental agreements10 to which the EU is signatory. One of them was
the United Nations Framework Convention11 on Climate Change (UN FCCC) which addressed
solving the issue of increased Earth surface temperature due to emission of greenhouse gases. This
document has been a controversial one, especially in the EU and the United States (US). ―The
source of controversy has not been science but the implications for environmental policy: it is
difficult to see how greenhouse gas emission reduction can be secured without raising the price of
energy significantly‖ (Pearce, 2001, p. 231). However, the EU, with a special status at UNCED, is

Change, which was the document that followed the UN FCCC. In the context of the Kyoto
Protocol, the EU has committed itself to jointly reducing its greenhouse gas emissions by 8% (the
largest cut, greater than the 7% national reduction target of the US, which did not ratify the
Protocol) from 1990 levels by 2008-2012. That was possible because the EU had worked out a
common negotiation position with its Member States. Moreover, the EU is signatory to the UN
Montreal Protocol on Ozone Depletion.
All the above-mentioned documents are international multilateral agreements between
sovereign states. The EU is not a state. Nevertheless, being signatory to such agreements proves that
the EU ―has stepped up efforts to gain formal recognition as an international actor in environmental
policy‖ (Lenschow, 2005, p. 323) and that it has taken the lead in the fight against climate change
and the promotion of a low-carbon economy. Given this, the EU should be considered a global
player in promoting sustainable development.
This might explain why, behaving like a ―leading protagonist for a stringent international
regime, frequently holding out in negotiations against the US for higher targets for emission cuts‖
(Baker, 2000, p. 328), the EU is currently working for a global agreement. Such a global agreement
would help reduce global emissions of greenhouse gas beyond 2012, which is when the first
commitment period of the Kyoto Protocol ends. Moreover, this sort of agreement will facilitate the
introduction of a new financial architecture. For that matter, it should be legally binding.

2. THE 2009 UN CLIMATE CHANGE CONFERENCE AND THE COPENHAGEN
ACCORD

According to the Bali Road Map, a framework for climate change mitigation beyond 2012
was to be agreed at the 2009 UN Climate Change Conference in Copenhagen. The conference
included the 15th Conference of the Parties (COP 15) to the UN FCCC and the 5th Meeting of the
Parties (COP/MOP 5) to the Kyoto Protocol. It was described on the official website of the UN
FCCC as ―an exceptional event that attracted unprecedented participation and resulted in attendance
by 120 Heads of State and Government and raising climate discussions to a new level‖ 12.
It is important to notice that these Heads of State and Government (of developing and
developed countries) came with different expectations at the Copenhagen Summit. ―For the EU the
Copenhagen Summit was originally about the final sharing-out of the remaining carbon budget of

12

See: http://unfccc.int/meetings/cop_15/items/5257.php

until 2050. For many other countries, including industrialized ones, the Copenhagen Summit has
been more about architecture than about cuts in carbon emissions as such‖(Egenhofer and Georgiev,
2009).
When it comes to perspectives, those of developing countries differ from those of developed
countries. ―Developed countries are more concerned about global problems such as climate change,
while developing countries attach greater priority to rural issues such as desertification and soil
erosion and urban environmental issues such as water pollution and air quality in cities‖(Newell,
2005, pp. 222-223). Also, ―many developing countries have been critical of the way in which
certain issues (debt, terms of trade, regulation of multinational companies) have been actively kept
off the agenda of summits‖ (Newell, 2005, pp. 224-225). For the developing countries climate
change mitigation is ―a short-term ‗constraint on economic growth‘, mainly but not only because it
puts a constraint on the use of coal‖ (Egenhofer and Georgiev, 2009). For the industrialized
countries (including the EU) ―climate change mitigation is framed in the context of green growth
and jobs and future competitiveness‖ (Egenhofer and Georgiev, 2009). Moreover, developing
countries view developed countries as main, sometimes sole, producers of greenhouse gas and
expect the latter to make cuts in GHG emissions first. In the context of adaptation to climate
change, ―developing countries, especially least-developed countries, are more vulnerable as their
adaptive capacity tends to be lower than that of richer countries‖ (Egenhofer and Georgiev, 2009).
Apart from technologies for adaptation to climate change, ―for developing countries, one of the key
concerns has been the growth in environmental standards that many fear will be used as barriers to
trade and discussed forms of protectionism to protect Northern producers from competitive exports
from the South‖ (Newell, 2005, p.225). These expectations and perspectives might help explain
what happened at the Copenhagen Summit.
Shortly after the summit began, a draft document, the so-called ―Danish text‖, leaked.
According to John Vidal, in the Guardian, this draft agreement would have forced developing
countries to agree to specific emission cuts and measures that were not part of the original UN
agreement, further divide the category of developing countries by introducing the category of socalled ―most vulnerable‖ countries, weaken the UN role in handling climate finance by handing
effective control of climate change finance to the World Bank and not allow poor countries to emit
more than 1.44 tonnes of carbon per person by 2050, while allowing rich countries to emit 2.67
tonnes (Vidal, 2009). The ―Danish text‖ caused developing countries to react furiously. Their
protests lead to prolonged negotiations.

and the BASIC countries: China (as the world's biggest producer of carbon dioxide, the chief
greenhouse gas), India, South Africa and Brazil. This was done without democratically involving
other important parties to the UN FCCC (the EU) in the drafting process and in the final round of
negotiations. The result was a legally non-binding document, namely the Copenhagen Accord.
This document meant that developed countries, including the US, recognized the scientific
case for keeping the rise in global temperature to 2°C. Also, developed countries committed to
jointly mobilizing $100 billion annually by 2020 from both public and private sources and to
providing financial resources that would help developing countries (especially the least-developed
ones) to mitigate and adapt their technology to climate change. Moreover, the importance of carbon
markets, which are important for the EU environmental policy, has also been recognized.
Reactions to this document were diverse. ―Judging from the high rhetoric heard before the
Copenhagen meeting, urging parties to complete negotiations on a new international agreement on
climate change to follow the Kyoto Protocol, the results (the Copenhagen Accord) must be seen as a
failure‖(Egenhofer and Georgiev, 2009, p.3) or a ―disaster‖, according to the EU Swedish
Environment Minister Andreas Carlgren. Moderates described the outcome as ―neither earthshattering nor a failure‖ (Levi and Rubenstein, 2009) or as a foundation for global action, although
―there is much further to go‖ (US President-elect Barack Obama).
For us, the Copenhagen Accord is a curious case and proof that the EU is no longer the
leader of the fight against climate change. The EU has played a marginal role at the Copenhagen
Summit and so did the US. The Copenhagen Accord, which is yet to be adopted by UN FCCC
parties, is also a perfect example of a deadlock. China (a developing country) refused to agree with
the US nonnegotiable proviso: ―all other major nations would first be required to commit their
emissions reduction to a binding agreement and submit these reductions to ‗transparent verification‘
in greenhouse gas emissions data (Lee, 2009). The Chinese officials argued that such a degree of
transparency would be a violation of Chinese sovereignty and national interests, when in fact ―Wen
(Jiabao) would not want foreign experts reporting to political masters in America and Europe that
Beijing's capacity to compel local officials and locally managed, state-controlled enterprises-some
120,000 companies and countless other subsidiaries - to implement climate-change initiatives is
extremely poor‖ (Lee, 2009). Therefore, negotiations at the Copenhagen Summit focused on the US
and China trying to reach a legally binding agreement for fighting climate change. In order to seal a
deal that would have also helped passing new climate change legislation in the US, Barack Obama
accepted China‘s conditions. That may be why the Copenhagen Accord has also been described as
―probably the weakest compromise in the world‖ (Deutsche Bank, 2009).

the US played marginal roles during the Copenhagen Summit. This time developing countries
(Non-Annex I Parties13) were the ones to make their voices heard in UN climate change
negotiations. The only problem was that they did not speak with one voice: while the G4 group of
developing countries sided with the US in drafting the Copenhagen Accord, the G77 group of leastdeveloped countries protested vehemently against the former. As a result, on the 19 th of December,
COP only ―took note‖ of the Copenhagen Accord.

3. THE US RESPONSE TO CLIMATE CHANGE

In order to better understand why a legally binding agreement was not reached in
Copenhagen, we also need to explain the way in which sustainable development is perceived and
how the climate change issue is dealt with within the US.
With regard to sustainable development, ―like any other policy commitment, it ultimately
requires the support of (the US) Congress and strong, effective legislation. However, for the
Republican leaders in Congress, sustainable development is simply a problem for other countries to
worry about, particularly developing countries‖ (Bryner, 2000, p. 277).
As far as climate change is concerned, ―the US Congress joined the debate in July 1997
when the Senate unanimously passed a resolution (Senate Resolution 98 14) aimed at ensuring that
the US and other developed countries would not sign a climate change agreement that did not
impose on developing countries at least some (if not similar) commitments to reduce greenhouse
gas emissions‖ (Bryner, 2000, pp.291-292). This ―reply‖ to the Berlin Mandate15 specified that any
climate change treaty should include commitments for greenhouse gas reduction for developing
countries and should not result in serious harm to the US economy. ―Without binding commitments
from the developing countries industry representatives (in the US) charge that this will unfairly
advantage developing countries industries in global markets‖ (Bryner, 2000, p. 293). Also, during
the 90s, environmental ―agreements have either advantaged or imposed fewer burdens on European
producers compared to their American competitors. Hence the US has generally opposed these

The Berlin Mandate exempted non-Annex I countries (developing countries) from additional binding obligations, in
keeping with the principle of "common but differentiated responsibilities" established in the UNFCCC even though,

the EU, not the US, became a leader of the fight against climate change during the 90s.
At present, passing new climate change legislation16 that would show commitment of the US
to the idea of fighting climate change is a difficult process, given the lack of involvement from the
US Congress. Although the House of Representatives passed the climate change bill, climate
change legislation must also get through the Senate (Reuters, 2009). Otherwise, the result might
very well be another deadlock at the COP 16/COP 6 Conference in Mexico later this year.

4. THE COPENHAGEN ACCORD, A GLOBAL GREEN ECONOMY AND
GLOBAL GOVERNANCE

The Copenhagen Summit may have also been a first attempt to introduce a new economic
model, a global green economy17. As proof, in February 2010 Fox News revealed to the public a
leaked UNEP18 discussion paper 19 on the green economy which states that ―shifting towards a green
economy will also help to address challenges posed by climate change‖ 20. On the UNEP official
website of GEI21 we find that: ―UNEP has also been working with a large number of UN agencies
and other intergovernmental partners to harmonise green economy policy messages. For example,
in June 2009, UNEP, together with more than 20 UN agencies, the IMF 22 and the World Bank,
issued a joint statement 23, which noted that the current financial and economic crisis requires a
collective response from the global community that lays a solid foundation for shared growth and
sustainable development‖24. This statement concluded: ―The solidarity of the international
community is being tested. The most representative test case is when governments meet to seal the
deal on climate change in Copenhagen in December 2009. Let Copenhagen be the turning point for
ushering in a global green economy‖ 25. Could the possibility of UNEP introducing a new economic

―taking note‖ of a politically binding agreement?
What is even more curious is that a UN FCCC negotiating text26, a document which was
published before the Copenhagen Summit, stated that: ―The scheme for the new institutional
arrangement under the Convention will be based on three basic pillars: government; facilitative
mechanism; and financial mechanism, and the basic organization of which will include the
following: (a) The government will be ruled by the COP with the support of a new subsidiary body
on adaptation, and of an Executive Board responsible for the management of the new funds and the
related facilitative processes and bodies. The current Convention secretariat will operate as such, as
appropriate‖27. Was it the fear of countries signatories to the UN FCCC for losing their sovereignty
to an international COP-led government that prevented ―sealing of the deal‖?
There is also another explanation. Although developed countries have committed themselves
to providing financial resources to developing countries by means of a Copenhagen Green Climate
Fund, where such funding will come from is not specified in the Copenhagen Accord. The draft text
only mentions that ―this funding will come from a wide variety of sources, public and private,
bilateral and multilateral, including alternative sources of finance‖ 28. This vague statement might
give the opportunity to international financial institutions to undermine the UN FCCC. Both the
IMF and the World Bank have outlined and implemented climate change financing ideas. The IMF
proposed a ―Green Fund‖29, while the World Bank portfolio of climate investment funds consists of
the CTF30 and the SCF31. For the World Bank, financing will take the form of credit enhancement
and risk management tools, such as loans, grants, equity stakes, guarantees and other support
mobilised through donor contributions to the respective trust funds and implemented in
collaboration with the regional development banks (Tan, 2008).
At this point, we ask ourselves: ―what would happen if developing countries do not return
the loans awarded by the World Bank?‖ The term neocolonialism32 comes to mind. ―Africa today
pays more money every year in debt service payments to the IMF and World Bank than it receives
in loans from them, thereby often depriving the inhabitants of those countries from actual

Neocolonialism is a term used by post-colonial critics of developed countries' involvement in the developing world.

Plans upon these nations. Adjustments that largely consist of privatization programs which result in
deteriorating health, education, an inability to develop infrastructure, and in general, lower living
standards‖33. That may offer an explanation for the G77‘s protests.
Let us not forget about the ―curse‖ of the developing countries: natural resources, which are
described as ―gifts of nature‖ on the official page of the World Bank Group. It is important to notice
that international financial institutions may adopt ―a competing perspective that has long been
present in the study and practice of world politics which views natural resources as an instrument of
control and leverage over other states‖ (Hastedt and Knickrehm, 2003, p. 284). By ―natural
resources‖ we mean oil (the most important natural resource of the 70s, 80s and 90s), natural gas
and fresh water (the most important natural resources in the last decade), even forests and clean air
(probably the most important natural resources in decades to come). Bearing this in mind, the
reaction of the G77 group was justified.
Last, but not least, ―international financial institutions have directly promoted and financed
fossil fuel-intensive projects throughout the developing world; the immediate beneficiaries of the
World Bank‘s projects are G7-based corporations‖(Sobhani and Retallack, 2001, p.224). Also, ―by
building fossil fuel-based infrastructures so mindlessly throughout the world to meet the ever
growing energy-intensive needs of economic globalization and the development model it promotes,
the World Bank and the other multilateral development agencies are playing a leading role in
fuelling climate change‖ (Sobhani and Retallack, 2001, p.224).
All the above explanations may shed some light on the curious case of the Copenhagen
Accord.

5. CONCLUSIONS

The expectations for the 2009 UN FCCC Conference were not reached. The Copenhagen
Summit has been an attempt of introducing a legal framework for a new economic model, the green
economy, and a new institutional arrangement. Negotiations for a legally binding agreement for
climate change mitigation have been deadlocked. Not being involved in the drafting process of the
Copenhagen Accord and thus not being able make its voice heard, the EU has currently lost its
leader status in the fight against climate change. The result of the Copenhagen Summit, the
