1 Necessity of the multibody simulation
The dynamic stability plays a crucial role in the operation of a forklift. It is determined by the geometrical dimensions, the tire characteristics and the position of the
overall center of gravity. The tire performance determines whether a vehicle tilts or slides into a sharp turn.
To improve the dynamic stability and prevent forklifts
from tilting active systems such as Toyota’s “SAS” and
Jungheinrich’s “Curve Control” are used. In order to
ensure that a forklift truck is suﬃciently safe to operate, it is very important to have exact knowledge of the
dynamic properties of the tire.
Many attempts have been carried out to describe
the dynamic stability quantitatively (see [4], [15] and
[16]). The standard DIN ISO 22915-2 describes simple
tests for measuring the static and dynamic stabilities
on a tilting platform. The data on the behavior of a
vehicle in a bend can be deduced from the lateral tilt
angle. The standard DIN EN 16203 has been developed
to reach a deﬁnite conclusion regarding forklift dynamic
stability and to assess the inﬂuence of the active stability systems. The standard describes a course in which
an L-shaped sharp turn is made at full speed. The necessary width of the exit corridor for this maneuver is
used as the benchmark.
The conduct of an L-test poses many diﬃculties.
A particular challenge is posed by the technical eﬀort
needed to achieve reproducible results. To reduce the
experimental eﬀort required for new forklift prototypes,
multibody simulations in which dynamic stability is assessed are carried out. A tire model is needed for a
multibody simulation to be meaningful. Many numerical tire models represent the behavior of pneumatic
tires, for example, UA Tire Model [11] and Pacejka’s

available in simulation software. All the models can be
subdivided into mathematical, semi-physical and physical models, according to the approach taken. Mathematical models use a phenomenological approach and
determine the tire behavior by mathematical approximation equations. Such models for agricultural machinery are described in [23] and [17]. Mathematical
models are easy to use, quick or real time capable and
oﬀer a high degree of precision. Eﬀects like vibration
and interaction with obstacles, however, cannot be described and more intensive measurements are needed
to determine all the model parameters. Semi-physical
or physical models are used to make better predictions
for ground-tire-interaction. It is often not easy to make
strict distinctions. Some models use a mathematical approach for the tire combined with a physical approach
in the contact area as in MF-Swift tire model [1]. Semiphysical models like [18] and [24] are built of strings
or brushes and can predict pressure distribution in the
ground. A further improvement can be achieved by using one or more interacting rigid or ﬂexible belt elements to describe the carcass of the tire. Such models
can be used to describe comfort and vibration transmission in the tire (see CTire [12], FTire [13] and CDTire
[10]). The approach that is most time consuming, but
at the same time provides the most insight involves the
use of the 3-dimensional FEM (ﬁnite element method)
analysis as in [2] and [3].
Super elastic tires (SE-tires) have their origin in
pneumatic tires that are ﬁlled with soft rubber [21].
Fig. 1 shows a schematic representation of a tire-rim
combination. The tire can be made of several asymmetrical layers of rubber. Every rubber layer is specially designed to ensure low abrasion; low vibration
transfer or uniform heat distribution. Standard models, however, are primarily designed for tires ﬁlled with
air used in automotive applications. They are only partially applicable to super elastic forklift tires. This can
be explained by diﬀerent operational conditions such

as low speed combined with increased maneuverability
(high slip angles) and construction diﬀerences.
To obtain more understanding about forklift behavior tires were measured under various operating conditions. From the measurement data, an empirical tire
model for static and dynamic behavior was developed.
Model parameters for 5 diﬀerent tire types were estimated to be used in further multibody simulations.

A measurement program that allows a wide variety
of operating conditions to be measured was developed.
The variation of the slip angle and the wheel load is
particularly interesting for determining the lateral behavior of a tire. The slip angle α is the angle between
the intersection line of wheel plane and road plane and
the vertical projection of the tire trajectory velocity
vector on the road plane [9]; the slip rate α is thus the
˙
time derivative of the slip angle. The wheel load was
increased up to the nominal load in 3 steps during the
tire measurement. In each step, the slip angle was adjusted within a range of −45◦ to +45◦ while the speed
and slip rate were also gradually increased. Due to a
short measurement time, the temperature increase in
a tire is low. The thesis by Busch [5] showed a small
inﬂuence of temperature on the lateral force. In order
to keep the inﬂuence of the momentum of the test apparatus as low as possible and emphasize the dynamic
eﬀects in the tire, all the measurements were carried
out at slip rates of between 15 ◦ /s and 30 ◦ /s and a
speed of between 0.5 km/h and 25 km/h.
The measured data includes noise in a relatively

eral causes. The tread pattern yields a ﬂuctuating load
force proﬁle in the medium-frequency range. The tire
testing drum has a 2-component polyurethane coating with quartz sand embedded (grain diameter 0,40,7 mm) to reproduce the tarmac friction characteristic. This coating leads to high-frequency noise. Small
deviations in the centering of the tire that arise during
assembly and the irregularity of the tire material cause
severe low, tire-rotation-periodic oscillations. These are
especially noticeable at low speeds. These parasitic side
eﬀects can be almost eliminated by suitably ﬁltering the
measured data. For visualization purposes a 2nd order

The thesis by Busch [5] provides a comprehensive insight into the lateral dynamic behavior of super elastic
tires. In this study, a model using artiﬁcial neural networks has been built. This model provides physically
correct values, but has disadvantages typical of neural
networks.
The creation of training data is in itself a complicated task and inopportunely selected data can lead to
an over-adaptation of the network. It is compounded by
the fact that the use of artiﬁcial neural networks allows
only limited insight to be gained into the actual physics
of the tire. In addition, several weighting matrices describe the network, which is cumbersome in practice.
And ﬁnally, the insuﬃcient extrapolating ability of the
neural network can lead to wrong predictions outside
of the boundaries of training data set. This can cause
problems when sharp cornering is modeled because the
for the Super Elastic Tire Model (SUPREM). The
SUPREM allows a high approximation quality to be
achieved with a minimum of tests. At the same time,
the model allows a deeper insight to be gained into
the behavior of the tire. Unlike a theoretical model
(for example involving the use of an FEM calculation)
the amount of computational work required should stay
low.
The following objectives were pursued during the
creation of the model:
– The model must be valid for diﬀerent types of SEtires without the model structure being changed.
– The model should be easy to implement.
– The number of input variables and parameters should
be kept low.
– The model should be applicable to other types of
tires.
– The eﬀort required to parametrize the model using
the measured data should be low.

havior can be described as stationary and be approximated by a hyperbolic tangent function. It is originsymmetrical and runs for rising angles to +1 or −1.
The argument of the hyperbolic tangent function describes the slope of the curve at the graph origin and
hence the ”speed” at which the function reaches its ﬁnal
value.
The function argument is aﬀected by the slip angle
and the wheel load. Larger slip angles lead to a higher
lateral force that converges for high slip angle values. A
higher wheel load causes higher maximum lateral forces,
but reduces the inﬂuence of the slip angle on the overall
lateral force. When the load on the wheels is higher, the
stiﬀness of the materials used in such wheels increases,
resulting in higher rotational stiﬀness. Increasing rotational stiﬀness leads to a deterioration in lateral force
transmission at small slip angles. These observations
lead to the following approach for describing the lateral force:
FY,stat = FZ · µ · tanh

α
kα + kF 2 · FZ

3.2 Static behavior of tires
Fig. 5 shows the typical lateral force behavior of an
SE-tire. The main factors are the slip angle α and the
wheel load FZ which both have an impact on the lateral
force. The lateral force increases with higher wheel load,
while with higher slip angle the lateral force converges
towards a constant value.

FZ is the wheel load, µ is the coeﬃcient of lateral friction and kα and kF 2 are parameters available for the
approximation of the model to the measured data. Parameters kα and kF 2 deﬁne load-independent and loaddependent parts of the normalization term and adjust
the inﬂuence of the slip angle on the lateral force.
Fig. 4 shows the quasi-static lateral friction coeﬃcient that was determined by measurement. The slip
angle α is set at 45◦ . At this setup the maximum lateral force can be achieved. The wheel load was adjusted
in 300 N steps up to 10 kN. Higher wheel loads could
not be measured due to high heat development in the
tire. When the loads are low, lateral friction coeﬃcient
shows a nearly linear dependence. When the loads are
higher, especially when they are above the rated load
of the tire (rated wheel load of 18x7-8 tire is 16180 N),
the linear approximation leads to incorrect results being
obtained because the modeled friction tends to zero and
can also become negative. This happens under forklift
truck safety test conditions where the wheel load can
exceed twice the rated wheel load.
In further examinations, it was also determined that
the lateral friction has a wheel load under proportional
behavior. An approximation of the measured data by an
exponential function with an estimated parameter kF 1
leads to more accurate results being obtained. These
observations lead to the following approach for describing the quasi-static friction coeﬃcient:

4 Dynamic tire model
Damping eﬀects arise during a dynamic force change
in a wheel. They appear in the measured data as a
hysteresis, which is approximately symmetrical to the
graph origin and is aﬀected by the speed of the wheel
and the temporary change of the lateral force. Such behavior can be explained theoretically using the string
model (String-Type Tire Model) [19]. The tire contact
patch is described as an interconnection of several prestressed strings connected to tread elements and having a certain stiﬀness. The deformation that takes place
due to the load deﬁnes the transmission of lateral force.
During a dynamic force change the transmission characteristics of the string model can be approximated by
a PT1 transfer behavior. In [22], examinations were car-

ried out on tractor tires and the results were found to
be consistent with PT1 transfer function behavior.
The entire tire model can be represented as a series
connection of a static non-linearity and a linear transmission function. Models like these are called Hammerstein models and are a simpliﬁcation of the Volterra series [14]. The general equation for the dynamic model
can thus be formulated as follows:
˙
FY,dyn + T · FY,dyn = FY,stat ,

(4)

where T is the time constant.
Several measurements at diﬀerent slip rates (α =
˙
5 . . . 90 ◦ /s) and speeds (v = 0.5 . . . 25 km/h) were carried out to verify the assumptions and determine the
time constant. As a benchmark, the value of the hysteresis was selected when α = 0◦ , because at this point
the change of the lateral force is at its maximum and the
slip rate is constant. This leads to the maximal value of
the hysteresis. Test results can be seen in Figs. 6 and 7.
When the slip rate rises, the width of the hysteresis increases. Increasing velocity at constant slip rate
results in a narrower hysteresis. The linear relationship
with the slip rate conﬁrmed a proportional transmission
characteristic with a delay of the ﬁrst order. The time
constant T , however, is only constant for a given vehicle

could result in instability during a numerical calculation. Especially the need for diﬀerentiation may cause
a simulation to fail due to the occurrence of singularities. This can be prevented in many cases by adjusting the iteration step width. The static model provides
good stability and accuracy but only by small temporary changes in the lateral force.
An L-test with a complete MBS model was carried out to estimate the magnitude of the slip rate.
Rapid counter steering results in slip rates of more than
50 ◦ /s. As shown by a PT1 transfer behavior, the shear
force comes only with a delay, which makes extended
steering phases necessary. It can therefore be concluded
that only the dynamic tire model should be used to realistically assess the dynamic stability.

that the time constant can be described by the following equation:
T = kd · (v · 1 h/km)

−kv

.

(5)

The parameters kd and kv are estimated from measured data. The parameter kv expresses the velocity dependence of the time constant. For just one measured
velocity this parameter is set to 0, and only the constant
part kd is taken into account. A borderline case of this
function occurs at a very slow speed (v → 0). In that
case, the equation 5 leads to a singularity. In the measurement at low velocities very high values of T could
be calculated. This case is a limitation of the model. In
the multibody simulation of the forklift, the tire model
is only switched on after a short straight acceleration
phase up to a velocity above 0,05 m/s.
The dynamic tire model leads to a more complex
calculation process in the multibody simulation and

When lateral stress develops, a deformation arises and
leads to a displacement of the contact patch (see Fig. 8).
This displacement of the outer wheels increases the tendency of a counterbalanced truck to tilt laterally. This
eﬀect can be described in the multibody simulation either by a displacement of the contact patch or by a
tilting torque. The torque method was used to simplify the implementation. The torque is a product of
the wheel load and the displacement in the y-direction
(see Fig. 8). The torque is heavily dependent on the
lateral force and is approximated linearly in the model:
MX = FZ · ∆y ≈

.
kM

(6)

The parameter kM is estimated from measured data
and describes this correlation. The torque is set at zero
for the inner wheels. Although the contact patch is
moved, the tilt edge of the vehicle as a whole is not
aﬀected.

6 Inﬂuences of rim geometry
The model described has symmetrical lateral force properties. According to measurements, that is not always
the case. The diﬀerences in the deformation of the tire,
which are dependent on the direction of the slip, could
be clearly observed during the measurements. The inner
ﬂange of the rim supports the tire when lateral stress
develops and reduces the deformation. As can be deduced from Fig. 8, signiﬁcant deformation of the tire
can reduce the contact patch and reduce transmittable

This factor diﬀers greatly from 1 only in some types
of tires and is a product of distinct asymmetry of the

is extended by an additional nonlinearity of the linear
transfer function. The following function describes the
lateral force in an SE-tire:

An optimization algorithm determines all six parameters of the model simultaneously from raw data. For
every time step in the measurement ﬁle the tire model
is evaluated. Deviations between model and measurement of every time step are used to calculate the Mean
Square Error (MSE) which is used as an optimization
function. The optimization is achieved with the Generalized Reduced Gradient (GRG), wherein the starting solution must be guessed. The solver minimizes this
function to achieve its minimum. At the end of the optimization the model parameters are obtained at once.
Numeric optimization does not always lead to a global
minimum of the function and can stuck in one of local
minima. A good guess of the starting solution (model
parameters) can reduce calculation time needed. Although prior smoothing or ﬁltering reduces the value of
the optimization function, the impact on the estimated
parameters is negligible. A comparison of the measurement and simulation results can be seen in Fig. 9.
The extrapolation ability of the model was also examined. The model was not conﬁgured with the complete data set, but only up to a wheel load corresponding to half the rated load. The subsequent extrapolation showed a deviation of less than 10 % in the lateral
force. This ensures that even when short extreme loads
are applied in dynamic simulations, extrapolation accuracy is suﬃcient. In order to assess the quality of the
tire model, it was necessary to deﬁne a quality measure
that corresponded to the coeﬃcient of determination
and was above 99 % for the model described so that
the model has a high accuracy. The model therefore is

8 Tire parameters
The lateral behavior of ﬁve tire types was measured.
Three tires (200/50-10, 150/75-8 and 18x7-8) were examined according to their dynamic properties at diﬀerent speeds. The dynamic time constant of some tires
that were measured earlier and recycled could only be
estimated for a velocity of v = 12 km/h. Parameters of
the static model could be estimated in all cases.
Variations in the inner structure of the tires of different manufacturers, tire designs as well as ﬂuctuations
in the temperature and rubber mixture during the production can lead to ﬂuctuations of the estimated parameters. One tire came from a diﬀerent manufacturer
and resulted in a very diﬀerent lateral behavior (see tire
18x7-8 Manufacturer 2 in Table 2). Apparently, this tire
was made out of a ﬂexible rubber mixture. Curve ﬁtting algorithms can also lead to ﬂuctuations of calculated parameters. Model parameters presented in this
paper may have their validity for a speciﬁc tire model
of a speciﬁc manufacturer and give a rough correlation
between geometrical dimensions and estimated parameters. A speciﬁc tire type of a given manufacturer used in
a multibody simulation should be measured. A greater
sample size is needed to account for diﬀerent tire models of the same type and make a rough prediction of the
tire behavior possible.

A wide range of tires was selected for the measurement in order to take account of diﬀerent outer diameters, rims, load capacities and widths. Tire types 5.008, 18x7-8 and 200/50-10 have nearly the same outer
diameter, but diﬀerent widths. This helps to estimate
the inﬂuence of the tire geometry on the lateral behavior. Dimensions of measured tires are summarized in
Table 1 and estimated parameters in Table 2.
The rubber layer of the tire transfers forces from the
vehicle to the road. The deformation capability of this
layer inﬂuences the tire behavior. To compare diﬀerent
tires a cross-section-coeﬃcient was deﬁned as:
Dout − Din
CSC =
.
(12)
2·W
It takes the width W and the height of the rubber
bondage into account (half of the diﬀerence between
the tire diameter Dout and rim diameter Din ).
The parameter kF 1 describes the amount of lateral
force that can be transferred when a tire has a given
load. Thin and high tires with higher cross-section-coefﬁcients permit greater deformation and can transfer
merely lighter forces to the road. According to the measurement, a thin 5.00-8 tire can transfer nearly 50 % of
the force compared to a wider 200/50-10 tire when they
have a given load. As shown in Fig. 11a, tires with comparable cross-section-coeﬃcients tend to have a similar

Table 1: Dimensions and load capacity of industrial tires (DIN 7811-1 [6], DIN 7811-2 [7], DIN 7852 [8])

The two parameters kα and kF 2 are used to normalize the slip angle inside the hyperbolic tangent function.
kα normalizes the value of the slip angle by a speciﬁc
angle. kF 2 takes the stiﬀening eﬀects of the tire load
into account. The maximal load capacity was chosen as
the reference load for estimating the normalization contribution of this term. Measurements show a correlation
between the normalization terms (see Fig. 10).
Direction-dependent parameter kr has a value of approximately 1 for wide tires and is slightly higher for
tires with high cross-section-coeﬃcient (see Fig. 12a).
The displacement of the contact area and therefore
torque along the x-axis is described by the linearized
parameter kM . This parameter has a strong correlation
with the cross-section-coeﬃcient (see Fig. 12b). A ﬂat
and wide tire is less ﬂexible and therefore better for
dynamic vehicle stability.
kv and kd were able to be estimated for dynamic
model parameters. The time constant T at a speed of
v = 12 km/h was estimated for all the tires. As the
cross-section-coeﬃcient lowers, the value of the time
constant diminishes until it reaches a value near 0.11 s.
Measurements for more diﬀerent tires are needed
to make rough predictions about an unknown tire. No
measurements and therefore no assumptions were able

◦

to be made for tires with load capacity above 3,5 t due
to limitations in the measurement apparatus.

Contribution of wheel load in

The reaction of a tire to a slip angle is described by
the parameter kα . A tire type with higher cross-sectioncoeﬃcients can be deformed more easily along the zaxis and therefore transfer less lateral force at a given
slip angle. Higher values of the parameter kα lead to
a smaller argument of the hyperbolic tangent function
and therefore lower lateral force at the given slip angle.
Weaker inﬂuence of the slip angle (higher values for kα )
in tires with high cross-section-coeﬃcient can be seen
in Fig. 11b. The value of this parameter for wide tires
is between 8◦ and 10◦ .

In this paper, a SUPREM model has been set up for
simulating SE-tires. It describes the transverse dynamic
behavior with high accuracy. The original model, based
on artiﬁcial neural networks, can be replaced by the
SUPREM model without any loss of quality in approximation, but with signiﬁcantly less complexity and with
a potential for further adaptation. SUPREM model
showed a better approximation quality especially for
very high and very low lateral forces due to neural
networks limitations. In the SUPREM model, a tire

clear structure, the model can be easily integrated into
many kinds of multibody simulation software without
the need for costly additional modules.
When several comparable studies were conducted
with the ﬁltered and unﬁltered data, it was found that
the noise had a low impact on the estimated parameters.
Further studies have shown that the dynamic behavior is aﬀected by high slip rates and must be taken
into account during stability simulations. Multiple individual measurements must be carried out at diﬀerent
speeds to parametrize the hysteresis. The correlation of
the slip rate with the width of the hysteresis requires
only one parameter, so that only one measurement is
necessary. Only one measurement is necessary if a vehicle is examined in a simulation in which approximately
constant speeds are used.
Further studies must be conducted to ascertain
whether the model is applicable to other types of tires
such as portal stacker tires or polymer rollers. The inﬂuence of rubber and inner layer design used by diﬀer-

ent manufacturers should be quantiﬁed. To validate the
multibody simulation with this tire model additional
