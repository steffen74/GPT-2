Introduction
In the contemporary reality, when the manufacturing activities are diminishing their
attractiveness at the level of the developed economies (because of the low labor cost from
the Asian economies), the European economy is steering towards sectors where the
required knowledge and education level are significantly higher and the ratio of added
value per used natural resources is also significantly higher. In this context, the
development of the knowledge intensive business services (KIBS) - those listed under the
following Romanian NACE codes: 62, 63, 69, 71-74; these activities are listed with similar
titles under other NACE codes in other European countries - at the level of the European
economies needs to be regarded as one of the best options. Thus, another clear advantage of
the KIBS sector that is increasing its attractiveness is represented by its low level of
required natural resources which is bringing this sector closer to the directions promoted by
the sustainable development concept which is included in the Europe 2020 Strategy.
The Romanian economy, part of the economy of the European Union (EU) is following the
general trend becoming more KIBS oriented, with a clear focus on the IT sector. Therefore,
it becomes obvious that pursuing a balanced evolution of the KIBS sector at the level of the
national economy can be regarded by the Romanian policy makers as a very powerful tool
for increasing the convergence speed towards the EU level.
The paper is structured in three main sections accompanied by introduction, conclusions,
where the economic implications of the main findings are presented and by annexes, where the
main steps of the econometric modeling are clearly described. A brief literature review and a
clear assessment of the theoretical background is provided in the first section. The second
section presents in a clear manner the main goal of the research, the methodological approach
and closes with a thorough presentation of the used data. Finally, the third section focuses on
the empirical results of the analysis providing some of their main economic implications.
1. Theoretical background
Starting with 2000, the European Council draws the attention towards the business modules
and entrepreneurship where there were identified five skills required for a knowledge
oriented economy: information and communications technology, technological culture,
entrepreneurship, social skills (European Commission, 2013).
The literature does not provide a clear conceptual definition of the phenomenon of business
associations that ensure KIBS. However, a series of common elements highly promoted by
various definitions may refer to: innovation, sustainability, creative entities that can take the
form of new organizations, or existing ones (profit or nonprofit) (Rubalcaba and Kox,
2007; Shaw and Carter, 2007).
In general, a strong support of entrepreneurship intensifies the business generation
phenomenon. In addition, by analyzing the performance of countries with a strong
entrepreneurial phenomenon -with a financial, fiscal, and educational frameworks
dedicated, or especially designed and developed for supporting the entrepreneurs- the idea
according to which more businesses with strong KIBS components are created within these
countries, is highlighted.
Different authors have shown that entrepreneurship and innovation represent key drivers of
regional economic growth and prosperity, stressing in the same time a relationship between
innovation and KIBS (Phillipson et al., 2004; Knudson et al., 2004).
An important aspect outlined in one of the most important attempts of describing the
conceptual framework specific to the activity of these knowledge intensive service
providers (Miles et al. 1995) shows the importance of the professional knowledge in the
development of the entrepreneurial phenomenon.
KIBS make a significant contribution to business productivity in certain sectors (Oulton,
2001; Baker, 2007).
First, they operate as an innovative practice which will bring later, at least to a certain
degree, an increase in other economic areas. Second, it directly supports innovation in other
sectors of the economy. Third, it plays a key role, acting as a bridge of innovative ideas and
development, in various parts of the economy (Bessant and Rush, 1995; Hargadon and
Sutton, 1997; Hargadon, 1998; Howells, 2006) and enables the application of basic
scientific ideas and knowledge, helping companies to exploit them in the best way possible
(Tether and Tajar, 2008).
2. Methodology related aspects
Along this section of the paper three important aspects are clearly described. The first sub
section deals with the goal of this entire research paper and provides a detailed description
in this regard. The second part of this section is dedicated to the methodology employed
during the presented research. In this part of the paper there will be presented a clear
description of all quantitative instruments that were used. Finally, in the last part of the
section, the data used are described and their source is presented so that any researcher can
conduct further research using this paper as a starting point.
The main goal of the current research paper is to analyze the evolution of the knowledge
intensive business services sector from Romania, for the period 2008–2014, from a
territorial point of view and to assess its impact in the general economic development.
More clearly, the paper provides a comprehensive analysis of the sector at county level,
emphasizing four dimensions of the sector: number of companies, number of employees in
the field, turnover of the companies from the field and number of new established
companies. The evolution of these dimensions both longitudinally and across counties will
be connected with the entire evolution of the Romanian business sector. The evolution of
the KIBS sector will also be presented in the broader evolution of the Romanian economy,
at county level, for the above mentioned companies. In the following sections of the paper,
the main implications of the findings reported in this paper will be extensively discussed.
The analysis presented in this paper is conducted at county level. The evolution of the four
dimensions (mentioned in the previous sub-section) of the KIBS sector are analyzed for the
period 2008-2014 both as indicators presented in absolute values and relative indicators
computed as shares from the national total. This approach enables us to also conduct an
analysis for assessing the spatial disparities (Strat, 2014) between Romanian counties. This
task is taken further by the use of a time series of Gini Coefficients which allows a
longitudinal analysis of the evolution of the disparities. Finally, the relationship between
the evolution of the KIBS sector and the entire economy of a county (the GDP at county
level is used as a proxy for the dimension of a county’s economy) is assessed through
several panel regressions.

Where i = 1, 2… N represents the Romanian counties, t = 1, 2… T represents the time
(period 2008-2012), βi are the parameters; the real GDP of the counties is determined using
GDP deflator (2010=100) expressed in mil. lei; no_firms_KIBS represents the number of
KIBS firms, turnover_KIBS represents the real turnover of KIBS firms determined using
GDP deflator expressed in mil. lei; no_empl_KIBS represents the number of employees of
the KIBS companies; cap_city_pop represents the number of inhabitants of each county’s
capital city expressed in persons; urban represents the urbanization level of the county
determined as ratio of urban population in total population. The three variables: number of
firms, turnover and number of employees of the KIBS companies were used as proxy
variables in order to assess the importance of KIBS activities at the level of the entire
economy.
Even though Romania is a member of the European Union since 1st of January 2007 it does
not have a fully functional regional administrative division. Since 1998 Romania is divided
into 8 development regions which since they were created have not received an official role
(these 8 regions serve as NUTS II units). At NUTS III level, Romania is administratively
organized into 41 counties and a capital city, which is also divided into six sectors (which
are individual administrative units). Also noteworthy is the fact that even though the
administrative system of Romania is not fully aligned to the European practices it has done
some serious steps towards a decentralized administration, during the last 25 years - during
the communist era, Romania was, like all other communist countries, a highly centralized
administration. (Figure no. 1)

The analysis presented in this paper is conducted using time series for the period 20082014. The sources of these data are the Tempo Database, available on the web page of the
National Institute of Statistics, from Romania, the Eurostat database and the database of the
National Office of Trade Register. All the data employed in this research are presented at
county level. The data regarding the number of KIBS firms, the total turnover of KIBS
companies, the number of employees of the KIBS companies, the number of newly
established KIBS companies were obtained from the National Office of Trade Register and
they are not publicly available. From the same source come: the total number of firms, the
total turnover of companies, the total number of employees of the companies’ sector and
the total number of newly established companies, at the level of each county. Therefore,
important to mention is the fact that these data are official data and are those recorded at the
level of the Ministry of Public Finances.
The data regarding: the GDP of each county, the number of inhabitants of each county and
the number of inhabitants of each county’s capital city were downloaded from the Tempo
Database. Also using data from the Tempo Database, the urbanization level was computed
by the authors, for each county, for the entire analyzed period.
3. Results and discussions
The evolution of the knowledge intensive business services sector at the level of the
Romanian counties and at the level of the entire Romanian economy can be regarded as an
accurate indicator of the economic development level, due to the fact that all the included
services require highly educated and specialized employees.
When discussing the KIBS sector in Romania it is important to state first its coordinates at
national level, for the analyzed period. In 2008 there were 55332 companies working in the
field, at national level, and after an oscillating evolution their number reached 56784 in
2014. In the same time the total turnover increased from 25771 million lei to 34310 million
lei and the number of employees decreased from 208163 to 197225. (figure no. 2)

Figure no. 2: The evolution of the turnover/employee
in the KIBS sector - nominal values
What is also important to mention is the fact that the productivity in the KIBS sector
recorded an increase during the period 2008–2014. The same trend, with an increase rate of
over 40% is recorded by the productivity (when expressed in turnover/employee) of the
entire companies’ sector at national level.
Noteworthy is also the fact that during the analyzed period most of the first eleven counties
have increased their number of employees reported to the total number of employees from
their economies. This trend is also visible when looking at the evolution of the percentage
of KIBS employees (in the national number of employees) represented by the first ten (the
presented eleven, except Bucharest) counties, during the analyzed period. (table no. 1)

During the same period, the percentage represented by the 10 counties with the smallest
number of KIBS employees has decreased to a value of 2.32% (after a value of 2.7% in
2008). Therefore, it is obvious that the KIBS activity is increasing in concentration in
Romania. This trend is recording a constant increase starting from 2010 (the year when the
effects of the global crisis had the greatest impact in Romania). Cluj County, Bucharest,
Iasi County, Brasov County and Prahova County are emerging as growth poles in this
sector and as mentioned before their importance grows year by year. (figure no. 3)
When discussing the evolution of the KIBS turnover, the previously mentioned
phenomenon is even more obvious and the increase is much more visible. In the same time,
the decrease recorded by the weakest 10 counties is also very clear. More exactly, the
weakest 10 counties are only responsible for 1.22% (of the KIBS turnover) from the
national turnover in 2014. In the same time Bucharest is diminishing its importance,
reaching a value of 58.51% while it started at 66.43%. Therefore, it is clear that there can
be discussed over a king and viceroys effect when analyzing the KIBS domain. Moreover,
during the analyzed period, the importance of the king decreases while the importance of
the viceroys increases. (figure no. 4)

number) represented by the first 10 counties (except Bucharest) – percentages

Figure no. 4: Percentage represented by the KIBS turnover in the total turnover
(first 10 counties without Bucharest) - percentages
The evolution of the average turnover/KIBS company is bringing supplementary evidence
that the domain is increasing its productivity, becoming more important at national level.
Over the period 2008-2014 the increase of the average turnover per KIBS firm was of over
29.73% while the average increase per national economy was of only 22.53%. (figure no. 5)
Another notable fact is that the average number of employees/KIBS company has
decreased with around 8% while the average number of employees/company (at the level of
the entire economy), at national level has increased with around 4%. Taking in
consideration this decrease in the number of employees together with the increase in
average turnover/KIBS company it is clear that the domain has increased its productivity
with a higher rate than the entire economy. (figure no. 6)
The increase of the disparities between Romanian counties, in what the KIBS sector is
regarded, during the analyzed period, is obvious when using the time series of Gini
coefficients which show a clear positive trend. (figure no. 7)

In order to further validate the main objective of the study, the empirical analysis contains
three regression models based on panel data.
In the three econometric models, the hypothesis of random individual and/ or time effects is
rejected (Haussmann test, appendix 1). The analyzed process presented individual fixed
effects for all the three models. Also, the Redundant Fixed Effects Test-LR- rejected the
null hypothesis (fixed effect are redundant), both for individual effects and for time effects
and also for the combination individual and time fixed effects (appendix 2), in all models.
The results of the estimation process - highlighted in table no. 2 ‒ strongly support the
hypothesis that the knowledge intensive business services sector from Romania, for the
period 2008-2014 manifests in terms of territorial distribution a significantly positive
impact on the whole economic development.

Note:* represents statistical significance at 1% level, ** at 5% level and *** at 10% level.
Thus, the regression analysis provides further evidences supporting the findings of the
previously presented analysis, namely that the main features of the KIBS domain: number of
firms, turnover, and number of employees can be regarded as main engines of the economic
growth at the level of the Romanian counties (the coefficients of these variables are positive
and statistically significant at several significance levels in the estimated models).

All estimated models are valid: Prob (F-stat.) is less than 0.05, Adjusted R2= 0.99, DurbinWatson Stat. = 1.81. The estimators are statistically significant at several levels of
significance (see the table) and it is clear that all the three KIBS variables can be used in
different econometric models destined for estimating the size of the economy at county’s
level, (all estimators are positively correlated with the endogenous variable).
The impact and the importance of the control variables, in estimating the size of the
economy (at county level), namely: the degree of urbanization of the county and the
population of the capital city of the county, is very clearly supported by the positive and
statistically significant coefficients from the models.
The county features (individual effects), given by the specificity of each county are
ˆ
captured by the coefficients αi (appendix 3 – Fixed Effects Coefficients). The differences

ˆ
in the values of αi may also have as causes different characteristics of the county, among
which the increase of KIBS firms, of employees or turnover.
In order to test the hypothesis according to which the fixed effects specific to each county
can be explained by the evolution of KIBS variables, the effect of these variables on the
ˆ
αi coefficients were evaluated using the following three models:

ˆ
αi = a0 + a1*nr_firme_KIBSi + ei
ˆ
αi = a0 + a1*CA_KIBSi + ei

(5)

ˆ
αi = a0 + a1*nr_angajati_KIBSi + ei

(6)

(4)

ˆ
In the first model, the number of KIBS firms explains 44% of variation of αi , while in the
second model, the turnover explains only 10% of the variance of the fixed effects, and at
the level of the third model, the number of employees explains at most 28% of the variance
of the fixed effects. (table no. 3)

In the second phase, the residuals of these models were analyzed (the part of the variation
which could not be explained by the previous presented models). These residuals could be
explained by better performance comparative with the national average in terms of
knowledge-based services and, of course, the influence of other factors with national
particularities (residual model).
The residual analysis, for the first model, which includes the influence of the number of
KIBS firms, reveals some counties with a low performance level, namely: Botosani
County, Salaj County, Harghita County, Dambovita County and Teleorman County and
some with a higher performance level (over the national average): Braila County, Galati
County, Dolj County and Constanta County. (figure no. 8)

Figure no. 8: The distribution of residuals
for model I which investigates the county level disparities
For the second model which includes the influence of the turnover, there are also some
counties which perform below the national average, like: Salaj County Harghita County,
Dambovita County Teleorman County and Giurgiu County and some counties which
perform above the national average, like: Braila County, Cluj County, Galati County, Dolj
County, Constanta County , Brasov County and Iasi County. (figure no. 9)

Figure no. 9: The distribution of residuals
for model II which investigates the county level disparities
In our third model, which presents the influence of the number of employees, the situation
is similar, with counties performing consistently below the national average, such as:
Tulcea County, Gorj County, Harghita County, Dambovita County Teleorman County and
Giurgiu County and counties performing above the national average, like: Braila County,
Galati County, Dolj County, Constanta County and Iasi County. (figure no. 10)

Figure no. 10: The distribution of residuals
for model III which investigates the county level disparities
Concluding we can state that, counties that record performances below the national
average, due to the influence of the KIBS sector, are counties such as: Salaj County, Tulcea
County, Harghita County, Dambovita County, Teleorman County and Giurgiu County
(counties with positive values for the Fixed Effects), while a superior (above the national
average) performance is recorded by counties like: Cluj County, Braila County, Galati
County, Dolj County, Constanta County and Iasi County (counties with negative values for
the Fixed Effects).

Conclusions
This paper can be easily framed in the literature that analyzes the evolution of regional
disparities. Within this study, the focus is on the development of the sector of the firms that
offer a high level of knowledge (companies active in KIBS) and hence on the importance of
this area in the economy, the analysis being done at the county level.
Before proceeding to a description of the main results obtained in the current research and
their main socio-economic implications, it is important to mention one more time the main
limitation of the approach proposed in this paper. This refers to the quality of data and in
particular to the degree of inclusion of the KIBS indicators, which are based on official
reports of MFP (unfortunately not all companies comply).
Over the analyzed period, the national level KIBS area showed an upward trend in terms of
number of firms, while the number of firms in the economy has fallen, this being
interpreted as a structural shift of the economy towards a knowledge intensive domain (the
share of KIBS firms increased by over 1% on the total number of companies). In terms of
number of employees, the domain lost nearly 6% of employees over the analyzed period,
however, this number of employees represents a higher percentage with 0.7% in the total
number of employees at national level, at the end of the period. Also, in the case of the
average turnover/firm, the KIBS area recorded an increase with over 10% higher than the
evolution recorded by the average turnover/firm in the entire business sector.
All these aspects highlighted the fact that the structural reorientation of the economy
towards the KIBS area can be explained by higher qualitative characteristics of this field (a
higher growth of the productivity).
Another important trend recorded for this area (with strong entrepreneurial character) is the
concentration of activity, i.e. development of growth poles. Over the analyzed period these
growth poles, including Bucharest, Cluj County, Timis County, Iasi County and Brasov
County are becoming more attractive for this type of businesses. The results of the
estimated econometric models, displaying positive and statistically significant coefficients,
support the hypothesis identified during the literature review process, namely the one
stating that entrepreneurship and innovation (KIBS activities) are key drivers of success. At
the same time the importance of the least attractive 10 counties decreased from 1.61% as it
was the turnover of KIBS companies in the KIBS turnover of the national level in 2008 to
1.22% in 2014. It is important to mention the fact that in this field we can discuss about the
king and viceroy effect, Bucharest being responsible in 2008 for 65.21% of the national
KIBS turnover and of approximately 58.51% in 2014. Thus, it becomes clear that for the
implementation of sustainable development policies it is mandatory to promote measures to
reduce the concentration of KIBS activity in the above mentioned poles (Bucharest and the
first ten counties are responsible for 88.77% of the KIBS national activity in 2014). The
existence of some high county level disparities is further confirmed by the estimated
models. Starting from the estimated values of the fixed effects we can identify counties
with a high performance, namely: Cluj County, Braila County, Galati County, Dolj County,
Constanta County and Iasi County and counties with a low performance, such as: Salaj
County, Tulcea County, Harghita County, Dambovita County, Teleorman County and
Giurrgiu County.
Concluding, it becomes obvious that the work done by companies from the KIBS area must
be regarded as focusing on support services for other productive activities and hence it
should rather be interpreted more as an indicator of the development level of a region
(econometric models clearly indicated that variables KIBS proposed can be used as
indicators of economic activity in a territorial unit) and not as a direct catalyst for the
economic activity of the region.
Thus, it is clear that economic activity in Romania has seen a concentration (it is obvious
when analyzing the time series of Gini coefficients) over the period 2008-2014 which,
besides the immediate effects of optimizing economic flows can have a negative long-term
effect, leading to lower economic robustness to external shocks. It is clear that the legacy of
the global crisis is represented by two Romania: the "effervescent" Romania of growth
poles that continues on the convergence path towards the EU's economic level and the
Romania of the poles of "quiet" that seems to have derailed from the convergence path.
Future research directions should include other key areas of the national economy in order
to allow the construction of a complete picture which can be used as a basis for decision
making by those responsible for the construction of macroeconomic policies.
