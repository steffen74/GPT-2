topics including product design, inventory management, carbon footprint measurement, refunds control, reverse logistics systems management, and coordination between the members
of channels [1–8]. In this paper, we take a look on pricing and refund policies and collaboration between members in the supply chain when they cooperate for greening initiatives.
In generally, most of previous studies of GSCM work on qualitative analysis and theoretical
research where less attentions are paid to quantitative aspects. One of the recent research
focused on quantitative concept is work of Zhang et al. [9]. They consider a two levels green
chain that contains a supplier and a producer who produces both types of green and non-green
products. They investigate the pricing strategies using both cooperative and non-cooperative
games between the supply chain members. Our assumptions are similar to Zhang et al. [9] by
this differences that we consider the refund policy as our main contribution in this paper.
Refund policy plays an important role for firms to ensure the customers that the quality level of
product can satisfy their expectations [10]. The refund policy can also stimulate customer
demand [11, 12]. Mukhopadhyay and Setaputra [13] indicate that around 70% of customers
consider the refund policy of retailer before making purchasing decision.
In this research we apply a refund strategy in a two levels supply chain consists of one
supplier and one manufacture who produces both green and non-green products. The
green products are reusable, energy efficient made with post-consumer materials, have
reduced toxicity properties, manufactured with minimal environmental impact, and are
delivered in eco-responsible packaging and containers. The term “green” often refers to
products, services or practices that allow for economic development while conserving for
future generation. A green product is one that has less of an environmental impact or is
less detrimental to human health than the traditional product equivalent. We assume that
supplier provides two types of raw materials for producing the green and non-green
products and manufacturer sells both types of products to the customers. Selling price and
refund amount of both products are determined by the manufacture. If customer is not
satisfied, can return the product to manufacturer and gets back the refund amount.
Moreover cooperative and non-cooperative environments between the supply chain
members are considered.
In the following sections, in “Literature review” section, the relevant works in two parts;
GSCM and pricing strategy are reviewed. In “Problem description” section we describe the
problem and in “Computational and practical results” and “Conclusion” Sections the hybrid
production mode under non-cooperative and cooperative games are discussed respectively.
Finally concluding section and future research directions are provided.

Literature review
The review of research papers in this section is divided in two subsections. In the first part we
focus on GSCM and in the second part, pricing strategy, refund policy, and coordination
between supply chain members are reviewed.
As the first work in GSCM, Navinchandra [14] proposes the idea of green product design,
for increasing products’ compatibility with the environment and without compromising their
functions or quality level. Vachon and Klassen [15] focus on the environmental collaboration

a new dynamics analysis in terms of market competition, recycling and profit function. Ghosh
and Shah [17] build game theoretical-based models to compare different structures of twolevel green supply chains. They show how channel structures can affect the selling prices,
greening levels, and profits. Results showed that when the cooperation between manufacturer
and the retailer is happen, green innovation could be maximized. Zhang and Liu [18] study the
effects of green products on market demand of a three stages supply chain including a supplier,
a producer and a retailer. They consider four models using the Stackelberg model and
cooperative decision-making process. Li et al. [19] develop a dual channel GSCM model
and focus on the pricing and greening strategies in both centralized and decentralized cases.
Giri and Bardhan [20] study the coordination between the member of a two stages supply
chain consists of a producer and a retailer where the demand of customers depends on both
environmental friendliness level and retailing price of the product.
Rao and Holt [21] and Chen et al. [22] study the GSCM usages and their relationships
between competitiveness and economic performance amongst a group of firms in South East
Asia. Chiou et al. [23] develop a mathematical model for encouraging the firms to apply the
GSCM and green innovation in order to enhance the environmental efficiency. Bowen et al.
[24] study the about desirability and slow implementation of GSCM in practice. Min and Galle
[25] explore the effects of “green purchasing” on packaging decisions and applying GSCM.
Olugu et al. [26] develop a group of criteria to evaluate the performance of GSCM. Liang et al.
[27] develop a seller-buyer supply chain model and use a group of data envelopment analysis
methods to evaluate the GSCM efficiency. Cao and Zhang [28] develop the green products’
utility diversity and coordination in the manufacturer- supplier green supply chain. Sheu [29]
study on the negotiation insides the green supply chain members’ relations that contain
manufacturers and suppliers. In the next section a review on pricing, refund and coordination
in supply chain is presented.
Webster and Weng [30] develop a producer-retailer supply chain model and study a refund
policy and compared results with the situation that no return is allowed. Taylor [31] combines
a buyback and rebate contracts to coordinate the supply chain including a producer and a
wholesaler when the demand rate depend on sales effort. Yue and Raghunathan [32] focus on
the information asymmetry and refund policy to coordinate the supply chains. Yao et al. [33]
analyze the influences of price sensitivity factors on refund policy in a coordination problem
using a mathematical model where the demand rate is stochastic and selling price-dependent.
Their results indicate that refund policy can improve supply chain performance. He et al. [34]
focus on a supplier-retailer supply chain contract and coordination and develop a mathematical
model with stochastic and retail price- and sales effort-dependent demand. Xiao et al. [35]
developed a mathematical model to coordinate the producer and the retailer of chain where
refund policy, buyback contract and uncertain demand are assumed. Li et al. [11] consider the
product quality as an important factor on customer behavior in online direct selling. They have
developed several models to show the relations among refund policy, quality, and pricing
decisions of product. Liu et al. [36] extend a Newsvendor mathematical model for a supply
chain including one producer and one retailer under considering customer returns and uncertain demand. Yoo [37] develop a supplier-producer supply chain model where the supplier is
risk aversion and study the relationships between decisions of quality levels and refund policy

customer’s decisions. Ringbom and Shy [53] use partial refunds in advance booking in a
single-echelon supply chain. They propose a developed method for maximizing the profit and
socially optimal rates of partial refunds on customers’ no-shows and cancellations. Ding and
Chen [54] investigate the coordination of a three stage supply chain (supplier, manufacture,
and retailer) in which product with short life cycle is sold. Su [55] develop a supply chain
model of consumer refund policy and study coordination strategy in the chain. He/she study
the impact of partial refund policy on the supply chain performance. Xu et al. [56] develop a
two-stage supply chain including one manufacture and one retailer. The main purpose of this
model is to determine of the selling price, refund and return deadline set by retailer. They
assume that the return deadline strategy depends on product lifecycle and the consumer’s
return rate. Roy et al. [57] and Chen [58] consider a two-layer supply chain that contains a
manufacturer and a retailer and use the classical newsvendor model for cooperative advertising
policy. He et al. [59] develop a model to determine optimal refund policies of multi products
single-period problem in supplier-retailer supply chain under uncertain demand market.
Majumder and Srinivasan [60] consider the contract leadership in a supply chain
network, and derive the optimal location for the channel leader. As an extension of Choi
[61], Choi [62] studies the case with the duopoly common retailer channel and finds that
product (store) differentiation benefits the manufacturers (retailers) but harms the retailers
(manufacturers); Choi et al. [63] investigate a CLSC which consists of a retailer, a
collector, and a manufacturer, and examine the performance of CLSC under different
channel leadership scenarios. Lee and Staelin [64] investigate the role of vertical strategic
interaction in driving the optimal channel pricing strategy under three game scenarios.
Almehdawe and Matin [65] consider a manufacturer and multiple retailers’ setup and
compare the efficiency of supply chain between the manufacturer-led and the retailer-led
cases. Numerical analysis appears that retailer dominance generally results in higher
supply chain efficiency. Gao et al. [66] explore the impact of channel power structure
on the decisions and performance of a CLSC. The results show that VN structure is the
most favorable for both the CLSC and consumers when the demand expansion effectiveness of collection effort is relatively low; otherwise, the CLSC with dominant retailer is
most profitable. Xiao et al. [67] develop game models to explore the quoted delivery
leadtime, price, and channel structure decisions for a make-to-order duopoly system
under three game scenarios and discover that decentralization can increase quoted
leadtime and both manufacturers may choose different channel structures under symmetric duopoly. Xu et al. [68] proposed a game model to analyze the game relationships
between enterprises and consumers in the home appliance industry. Barari et al. [69]
presented an evolutionary game model in which the producer manufactured green products and the retailer was responsible for attracting consumers to buy the green products.
Coordination between the producer and the retailer could balance the environmental and
commercial benefits. Moriarty and Moran [70] pointed out that there was inevitable
channel competition between the direct channel and the retail channel. Chiang et al.
[71] and Tsay and Agrawal [72] showed that channel conflict in the dual-channel supply
chain threw new challenges to the manufacturer and the retailer. Yao and Liu [73] argued
that in a dualchannel supply chain, the manufacturer and the retailer sold the same
products, which would lead to conflict and competition between them. To mitigate

53

could reduce the effect of double marginalization. Fruchter and Tapiero [74] found that a
manufacturer who has two distribution channels should adopt consistent pricing policies
across the two channels as his optimal policy. Yao and Liu [73] discussed the pricing
policies of Bertrand and Stackelberg equilibrium in a dual channel. Cattani et al. [75]
analyzed consistent pricing strategies between the manufacturer and the retailer. Specifically, the manufacturer and the retailer agreed on the results when the wholesale price
and sale price were set by the manufacturer to maximize his profit. Huang and
Swaminathan [76] investigated optimal pricing strategies when a firm distributed a
product through online and traditional channels. Dan et al. [77] examined pricing policies
in a dual-channel supply chain in which the retailer provides retail service. Results
showed that the pricing strategies of the channel members were greatly influenced by
retail services. Martín-Herran and Taboubi [78] studied pricing decisions and coordination in distribution channels from a dynamic perspective under centralized and
decentralized models. However, the above papers did not consider the situation in a
green supply chain management; therefore, a new one into green supply chain
management.
According to above literature review there is no research that simultaneously considers a
two-level supply chain in which both green and non-green products are produced and refund
policy for both products under both cooperative and non-cooperative strategies are considered.
Therefore, the main contribution of this paper is modelling the refund and pricing policies in
the two-level supply chain under hybrid production modes meaning producers produce two
types of products.

Problem description
Consider a two stages supply chain with a supplier and a manufacture. This supply chain
produces two types of products; green and non-green ones. In the aspect of usage and
functional they have similar but in the price and environmental effects may exist difference
between those. Also the whole sale prices of raw materials from the wholesaler to the
manufacture and the production costs of non-green and green items are different.
The other issue that we consider in this paper is refund policy because the refund can occur
for both products. In this paper the selling prices and refund amounts of both products directly
affect the customer’s decision about purchasing and returning the products. If customer is not
satisfied from the products’ characteristics, can return the product to the manufacturer and
gives back the refund amount. In the proposed supply chain the supplier has no responsibility
about the returned products.
In this supply chain, we focused on two different strategies, cooperation and
competition between the supplier and the manufacture. In non-cooperative strategy
we use the Stackelberg model where the supplier and the manufacturer act as the
leader and follower respectively. In cooperation environment the members join together and can help the supply chain members to enhance their profits. But the main
issue in a cooperative strategy in this paper is bargaining between the members in
determining the raw material selling prices of both green and non-green products. In

The main difference between green and non-green products to persuade the customer to choose one of them is the selling price, refund amount, and environmental
values when there is no significant difference in functional usages. We assume that
the consumer have different consumer valuation for products using Ferrer and

55

product and we define λν , (0 < λ < 1). In Eqs. (1) and (2) we consider the selling
price and refund amount as important factors of a product that can influence on the
utility functions. y1 and y2 are the return sensitivity of the utility level that indicates
the effect of refund amount on the utility functions for green and non-green products.
v is announced by consumer, but the selling prices, refund amounts, and raw material prices
of each product are determined by supply chain members. When Ug > Un customers buy the

In the next subsections, the described problem using both cooperative and non-cooperative
games is modeled. Superscripts N and C denote non-cooperative and cooperative games
respectively.

Pricing strategy in non-cooperative environment
In order to implement the non-cooperative strategy the Stackelberg game theory model is used
where the supplier and the manufacture are assumed to be the leader and follower respectively.
In the following we calculating the demand for each type of products and solve the optimization problem for obtaining the optimal selling price, refund amount, and raw material price
of both types of products.
Demands of green and non-green items are closely related to the customer’s utility function,
and consumer choose one of the products that satisfies his/her expectations more than the
another one. So to use the demand function two conditions should be considered: (1) Ug > Un;
(2) Ug ≤ Un. If Ug > Un the consumer buy the green product, so ν − Pg + y1rg > λν − Pn + y2rn
P −P þy2 r −y r
and we have ν > g nð1−λÞn 1 g where v ∼ U[0, A]. Then the demand quantity of green item
can be calculated using Eq. (5). For simplicity we define k ¼

If the above conditions are not met simultaneously, using optimization software the
problem should be solved.

Proof See Appendix A.
According to above theorem, the optimal selling price, refund amount, and raw material
price can be obtained using the first order derivatives of profit function with respect to the

Pricing strategy in cooperative case
In this section we model and optimize the problem using a cooperative strategy. In this
strategy, supply chain members join together with the objective of increasing their profits.
The bargaining between supplier and manufacturer happen when they decide to determine the
raw material prices for two products. For solving this problem we use Rubinstein bargaining
model.

Moreover Eq. (21) shows the profits of supplier and manufacturer in cooperative strategy in
the hybrid production mode respectively. Cooperative in the supply chain must be caused to
increase the profits of supplier and manufacturer. According to Eq. (21) the price of raw
materials (w1 , w0) has an important role to determine how the supply chain profit would be
allocated between the supplier and manufacturer. The supplier must determine a fair and
reasonable price of raw material to satisfy the manufacturer’s expectations, because determining the price of raw material leads to increase profit on both sides in the supply chain.

Reasonable values of selling price, refund amount, and raw material selling price make the
both sides in the supply chain sure that their profits in cooperative strategy are not less than
non-cooperative cases and maximize the profit of the system. So we hope that the profit of
manufacturer and supplier has increased in the cooperative strategy versus in the noncooperative strategy.

Computational and practical results
Consider a two stages supply chain with a supplier and a manufacture. This supply chain
produces two types of products; green and non-green ones. In the aspect of usage and
functional they have similar but in the price and environmental effects may exist difference
between those. Also the whole sale prices of raw materials from the wholesaler to the

For analyzing the effect of refund policy and hybrid production mode in the proposed twolevel supply chain in both cooperative and non-cooperative strategies between members of the
supply chain we use some numerical examples. We assume cs = 5$/item, cR = 15$/item, cr =
10$/item, A = 100 , λ = 0.8, y1 = y2 = 0.9 and refund parameters as ϕ1 = 0.003 , ϕ2 =
0.002 , φ1 = 0.009 , φ2 = 0.004 , τ2 = 0.0009 , τ1 = 0.0007.

The effect of parameters on profits and decision variables
The influences of parameters on decision variables, finished product selling price, raw material

Fig. 7 The effect of φ2 on variables in cooperative game

non-cooperative games are investigated. From Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, and
15 one can observe that ever w1 > w0 and Pg > Pn, but the refund amount of green and nongreen products are fluctuated. In Figs. 2 and 3 the effects of λ on decision variables under
cooperative and non-cooperative strategies are presented. According to these figures the
finished product selling price and raw material wholesale price of green product are not
sensitive to the change of λ while non-green product has a direct relationship to the changes.
φ1 and φ2 almost have the same effects on decision variables as presented in Figs. 4, 5, 6,
and 7. The decision variables are slightly sensitive with respect to the changes of φ1 and φ2.
Figs. 8, 9, 10, and 11 show the effects of τ1 and τ2 on decision variables. It is clear that none of

Fig. 9 The effect of τ1 on variables in cooperative game

As presented in Figs. 12 and 13, y1 has direct effect on refund amount especially in
cooperative strategy. Fig. 14 and 15 demonstrate the effects of y2 on decision variables. When
y2 < 6.2 in non-cooperative and when y2 < 5.5 in cooperative game, the system does not
produce the green product and just produce non green one.

Effect of parameters on demands
The influences of parameters on demands of green and non-green products in both cooperative
and non-cooperative situations are studied in this section. Figs. 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, and 22

65

Fig. 11 The effect of τ2 on variables in cooperative game

demands amounts in cooperative situation for both products are more than demands in noncooperative one. Figure 16 demonstrates that the λ influences on demands, it shows that the
green product has a convex behavior and the non-green product has a concave behavior.
Indeed when λ increases the demand quantity of non-green products first increase and then
decrease while the demand quantity of green products first decrease and then increase.
Figure 17 and 18 show the effects of φ1 and φ2, where in Fig. 17 the changes
have an exponential pattern and by increasing of φ1 the demand quantity of green
products increase while the demand quantity of non-green one decrease. But the
patterns of changes with respect to φ2 are completely different and have linear form.

quantity of non-green one rise. The effects of changes of τ1 and τ2 are shown in
Figs. 19 and 20 and have inverse treatments on demands of green and non-green
products and the pattern of changes are linear form.

When τ1 increases the demand quantity of green products increase too, but the
non-green products demands decrease. In the other hand, when τ2 increases the
demand quantity of green products decreases and the non-green products demands

demand of green items as presented in Fig. 21 under exponential patterns. Finally the
effects of y2 are presented in Fig. 22.

Effect of parameter on profits and refund amount of products
In this part we analyze the effect of parameters on refund amount of green and non-green
products and profits of supplier, manufacturer, and system in cooperative and non-cooperative
situations. From (Table 1) the profit of system in the cooperative case is more than noncooperative one.
By increasing the value of λ, refund amount of green product and profits in cooperative and
non-cooperative cases are increased and refund amount of non-green product is decreased.
Changes of y1 , y2 have direct relations with refund amount and system profits, unless y2 has

Fig. 17 Effect of φ1 on demand of green and non-green product

similar behavior and by increasing them the total profit and refund amount of non-green item is
reduced. But the refund amount of green product is increased. φ2 and τ2 have a contrariwise
relationship with the system profit in cooperative and non-cooperative games.

Conclusion
In the hybrid production supply chain, we propose and develop a decision model by joining
the pricing strategy, refund policy, and cooperation strategy together. We develop a mathematical model for a two stages chain that contains a supplier and a manufacturer. This supply
chain produces two types of products; green and non-green products such that they have a

costs are different. We consider the refund policy for both products, if a customer is not
satisfied from the product specifications, so he/she is permitted to return the product to the
manufacture and pays back the refund amount should be determined by the manufacturer.
We explore and investigate the best decisions under cooperative and non-cooperative
strategies took place between the members of chain. In non-cooperative situation, we use
the Stackelberg game such that the supplier acts as a leader and the manufacture acts as a
follower. Moreover in the cooperative strategy for achieving more profit, they join together. In
cooperative game we use the Rubinstein bargaining game to determine the fair and reasonable
raw materials whole sale prices.
We divide the results in three main parts. In the firth part we investigate on the effect of

Fig. 21 Effect of y1 on demands of green and non-green product

games. In the second part the effects of parameters on demands of green and non-green
products are studied, and we observe that when cooperation happens between the
supply chain members, the demands noticeably increase for both products and in the
third part the profit and refund amount sensitivities of each product are investigated.
Although in cooperation case, the refund amount of product is increased, but the main
purpose which is increasing profit is happened.
We assumed that there is no advertising on green products from the manufacturer
or government. So encouraging the customers for purchasing the green product by
