INTRODUCTION

If we take into account one of the simplest but self speaking theoretical construction of the
classical school of economics, named Crusoe Economics (Rothbard 1998: 29), we learn that
economical practices began as a result of natural labor division and exchange. From the very

is simplified to his instinctive decision making process, necessary to satisfy basic life sustainable
needs. In short, he must learn what, but mainly how to achieve a proper mix of land and labor, in
order to bring his ends and purposes into effect. The picture changes when, in this idyllic society,
another individual has landed. The newcomer, as well as the legendary hero, must mix his labor
with land in order to survive. Naturally, the two lean to attain their ends with minimal effort,
choosing firstly the simplest activities, but as they acquire technological knowledge the end
products are becoming more complex, reaching the point where their production exceeds domestic
consumption. Keeping in mind that their skills and interests differ, they have to shape their
economic activities of production and exchange in accordance with David Ricardo‟s Law of
Comparative Advantage. And this is how, as Rothbard points out, “the process of exchange enables
man to ascend from primitive isolation to civilization” (Rothbard, 1998: 36).
This short story is important mainly because it argues that “economics has revealed a great
truth about the natural law of human interaction: that not only is production essential to man‟s
prosperity and survival, but so also is exchange” (Rothbard 1998: 35). Furthermore, such an
analysis – of the interaction of two people in an uninhabited island, as abstract and simplistic as it
is, makes sense when the spectrum of thought widens to the size and complexity of contemporary
society.
Indeed, production, consumption and especially trade, under classical and neoclassical
economic philosophy, have generated economic growth and social prosperity. But this type of
development tickled a cost of environmental degradation, which over time, became big enough to
jeopardize our wealth and even our existence. The interdependent relationship between economy
and environment have been largely ignored by the neoclassical economists, where in their elegant
economical growth theoretical constructions, the natural environment has not been included.
However, since the early „70s, there were some vices that, through their rigorous studies, began to
draw attention to this issue, many of them speaking even of an imminent environmental,
economical and consequently a wellbeing crisis. A few years later these initiatives have echoed in
the developed world, giving rise to a new paradigm which would link economics with the
environment in a different kind of global development, under the name of sustainable development.
Therefore, eco-efficiency and pollution control quickly became targets for technological research
and development. Meanwhile, trade has adapted to change and – for example – a new international
market of biomass and bio-fuels emerged and quickly expended.

biomass reported to the philosophy of sustainable development. In short, we want to give an answer
to two questions: how much is biomass trade sustainable and what risks may arise if the main
source of energy used today, based on fossil fuels, will be totally substitute by biomass? For doing
this, the paper is organized as follows. The first section will briefly explore for what and for who is
the concept of sustainable development addressing, in order to emphasize on the one hand the
energy dependency of people and on the other hand, the need to change the global optics regarding
the sources through which this energy is produced, optics that embraces the idea of substituting
non-renewable resources with renewable ones in the production process. The following section will
focus on the biomass as an alternative to fossil fuels, on the trend in international trade of biomass –
focusing mainly on European space – the purpose being to capture the dynamics of the demand for
these products and last but not least, to draw the attention on the risks that we might face in the
event that the traditional fuel consumption will be replaced exclusively by biomass.

1. SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND BIOMASS

Although environmental issues were put on the carpet two centuries ago prefaced in the
writings of the classical economist Thomas Robert Malthus, in his Essay on the Principle of
Population, the main literature focused on the subject beginning with the decade seven of the last
century, through a series of papers, reports and international conferences, which worth mentio ning:
the club of Rome report, entitled Limits to Growth, published in 1972 by Dennis L. Meadows et al.;
Plan B book series by Lester Brown, founder of the World Watch Institute (WWI) in 1974 and the
Earth Policy Institute in 2001. The most important confe rences gathered representatives from all
over the world to discuss the problems with the environmental - economical and social
relationships, took place in Stockholm (1972), Rio de Janeiro (1992), in Kyoto (1997) and in
Johannesburg in 2002.
All these events have put into the light the environmental issues focusing firstly on the level
of consumption of natural resources, in particular the imminent depletion of the non-renewable ones
in the near future, secondly, on the problems with pollution control and adverse effects of human
activities over environment and biodiversity, and thirdly, on the never-ending bad story of poverty.
The way ahead was outlined and defined in what is called sustainable development in the
Brundtland Report entitled Our Common Future, published in 1987, when the new concept was
defined as “the kind of development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the

development – thus became the common language of economists, ecologists, sociologists,
philosophers and so on – has the task of finding a linkage between the environment and the society
(who exploits it), to improve the degree of compliance between them, in order to be able to continue
growth and development for us and for the ones who will replace those who live today.

1.1. Biomass resources

The influence of international trade over environment and welfare cannot be questioned, the
causal links between these different aspects of life are intimate enough so that any issue caused by
internal or external incentives in the market, finding – with little or no doubt – correspondent effect
in the social and environmental side.
To be sustainable, biomass, which is considered alternative sources of energy, must meet
certain criteria, such as: to possess a high capacity for regeneration, in a relatively short time; to
offer a better efficiency compared with the traditional fossil fuel sources; to be less or nonpolluting, to be used in solid, liquid and gaseous form; to have a broad applicability in production
and consumption; to have a competitive level in terms of costs and prices for transport or storage, in
both stages, as a raw material or as a finished product; to be a good substitute of traditional fuels
(gasoline or diesel), without the necessity for structural changes of the of the engine, etc.
For these reasons, biomass resources appear, in a good extent, to provide a compromise
between utility and eco-efficiency, having a real potential for sustainable energetic development.
The most important biomass energy sources are made of wood and wood waste, agricultural crops
and agricultural byproducts from waste, waste derived from food processing and other plant and
animal waste. Among these, the largest share in manufacturing biomass is wood and wood waste
(64%), municipal solid waste (24%) and agricultural waste (5%) (Demirbas et al. 2009: 1746).
In industrialized nations, biomass is mainly used as a source of fuel used directly or indirectly
(through combinations in different percentages between traditional and bio- fuels). The most used
biofuels are ethanol and biodiesel. The first is produced from several categories of biomass and
used as a substitute for gasoline. It can be used 100% as a transport fuel or mixed with gasoline in
different proportions. Used in blend, ethanol offers the advantage of significant reductions in
petroleum consumption and in greenhouse gas emissions, due to high oxygen concentration.
The second one, biodiesel, can replace diesel in the same way that ethanol replaces (or blends
with) gasoline, except that biodiesel can be used only if changes are made to the engine structure.

rapeseed oil or coconut oil or even recycled cooking oil.
In the European Community, demand for biofuels is growing, and as such, international trade
in these products are, for some time now, on an upward trend, described briefly in the following.

2. INTERNATIONAL TRADE WITH BIOMASS

With the diversification of the economies and growing concern of nations in fighting and
controlling the devastating effects of their gas emissions and in accordance with the gas emission
targets under Kyoto Protocol, the use of biomass has become more tha n necessary. One important
means of achieving this objective is to increase the rate of renewable sources in total of energy
supply. Thus, the European Union proposed, in the Renewable Energy Directive, a minimum of
35% to reduce the gas emissions, in terms of the agricultural and forestry biomass, solid and liquid
biofuels.
Growing demands in energy use and the increase of oil and coal prices have led to the
development of new energy sources such as biomass energy, water energy, solar, wind and
geothermal energy.

In 2008, approximately 18% of the European energy consumption came from renewable
sources, where 70% from those came from traditional biomass production and 9% from hydro
electricity. The new renewable energies (wind, geothermal, solar and biofuels) have a large and
growing area. According to the European Commission, the biomass represents 4% from the EU
energy needs. European Commission Action Plan sets out measures to increase biomass by creating

new opportunities for the developing countries (European Commission).
The literature review reveals that Latin America, Sub Saharan Africa and Eastern Europe,
North-East Asia and Oceania will be the most important biomass producers in the long term, while
the main demand will be found in OECD countries and Asia South East, which means that one of
the most important role trade will be played by biomass (Heinimo and Junginger 2009: 1311). As
the demand for biomass products is increasing, and international sales market is in developing,
these resources are unequal distributed in different parts of the world, the biomass trade is in a
continuous growth among the European Union countries.
According to the European Commission reports, the EU is a net importer, in the present the
rate of energy import dependency is 54%, and while in 2020 is expected to lead to an addiction rate
of 70% if no measures will be taken to increase production of domestic energy. Although fossil
fuels can‟t be replaced with renewable resources, it can be taken to combine them with those from
renewable resources in order to obtain the desired effect, which is reducing the gas emissions
(Magar et al. 2010: 2).
The European Union is far from being the largest producer of biomass; it must then rely on
imports, becoming a net importer. Thus, ethanol, vegetable oils, firewood, coal and wood pellets are
the most important products which are currently the most traded energy purposes. They may be
imported and used in their unprocessed shape or can be used as raw materials, in terms to be
exported. In the mentioned period (Table no. 2.) reflects the rate of imports dependence of
European Union, emphasizing it in 2008.

In 2008, primary production of biomass was 188 756 TJ higher than the previous year, this
upward trend mainly thanks to the growing importance of biomass energy.
Although the European Union is a net importer of energy, biomass imports are relatively
small. In 2008, imports of biomass were 2,4% of total primary supply, and according IEA, in2009
they have raised to a level of 4,5% of total primary supply (International Energy Agency).

increasingly more often other EU member States or beside.
According to the European Commission report on the sustainability requirements for the use
of biomass resources for electricity and gas, heating and cooling, increased trade is attributable to
the form of pellets (a type of biomass, generally made from waste forestry industries) (European
Commission).
Pellet production and consumption has increased in recent years, EU countries registered a
high consumption, so a number of countries outside the EU produce wood pellets only for the
European market. The biggest consumers of EU pellets were Sweden (1.8 million tons), Denmark,
Holland, Belgium, Germany and Italy (all about one million tons), the main suppliers being Canada
and the United States and Australia with a contribution of Argentina and South Africa. According to
EAI reports, the European Union in 2009 imported pellets worth of 3,9 million tones, of which half
were EU inside imports.
An overview of the biofuels trade shows that the largest global producers of ethanol are the
U.S. and Brazil; the EU is a net importer. In 2009 estimated data shows that were traded 40 - 50 PJ
of ethanol. Data on trade in ethanol are imprecise because of its multiple uses and lack of
appropriate codes for biofuels in global trade statistics. In 2009, EU states have produced biodiesel
of around 334 PJ (7,04 million tons), the main producers are Germany, France, Spain and Italy
(International Energy Agency).
Production of biodiesel in the European Union represents two thirds of world production of
biodiesel. According to the EAI report, biodiesel trade in 2009 totaled 80 PJ (1,60 million tons)
from a one PJ in 2005.
Import dependence varies between Member States, this being due to uneven spread of
renewable resources. Thus, the Netherlands, Denmark and Britain are major countries producing of
biomass, being the only member states where the ratio of import/export is negative, this being due
and rich endowment of renewable resources and their processing and refining capacity.
3. BARRIERS IN INTERNATIONAL TRADE OF BIOMASS

Over the time the demand for biomass products has increased, which led to an intensification
of international trade, development that was hampered by a number of barriers.
We define a "barrier in international trade in biomass" an issue that may directly or indirectly
affect the development of the biomass trade to final consumers. Thus, although the use of these

Commission's position to achieve by 2020 a level of 10% use of biofuels. They support the idea to
reduce the proportion up to 4% by 2015. Arguments supported by the members of the European
Parliament where about the negative effects of biofuels over the cultivated areas, leading to massive
deforestation, on soil, on water. Other critics have been on the effects of biomass would have it on
food prices, increasing those.
Major obstacles to international trade of biomass can be referred to the tariff, especially
affecting the ethanol trade, while logistical barriers have a greater impact on trade with pellets.
Technical barriers relate to physical and chemical descriptions of fuels, including biofuels, were
introduced to ensure the safety and health of consumers.
To counteract the effects mentioned above, the main importing countries began to develop
biomass national sustainability requirements for bioenergy, which led to the creation of some
systems of certification (voluntary and mandatory) in agriculture, forestry and energy sectors
(European Commission).

CONCLUSION
International trade of biomass produced by the European Union has intensified in recent years
and this upward trend may continue in the future because of growing concern of the EU Member
States regarding the sustainability and the effects that their greenhouse gas emissions have over the
environment. Although there have been many critics over the sustainability of biomass products,
their effects on the environment remain compelling. A step towards a wider application of biomass
should be a more pronounced promotion policy of biofuels and the effects they have on our
environment.
The EU Member States must intensify its efforts to increase investment in the renewable
resources by supporting and encouraging the production of biomass and the adoption of policies
that support production, utilization of renewable energy and providing incentives for biomass
production and consumption at national and local levels.

According to the European Commission report on the sustainability requirements for the use
of biomass resources for electricity and gas, heating and cooling, increased trade is attributable to
the form of pellets (a type of biomass, generally made from waste forestry industries) (European
Commission).
Pellet production and consumption has increased in recent years, EU countries registered a
high consumption, so a number of countries outside the EU produce wood pellets only for the
European market. The biggest consumers of EU pellets were Sweden (1.8 million tons), Denmark,
Holland, Belgium, Germany and Italy (all about one million tons), the main suppliers being Canada
and the United States and Australia with a contribution of Argentina and South Africa. According to
EAI reports, the European Union in 2009 imported pellets worth of 3,9 million tones, of which half
were EU inside imports.
An overview of the biofuels trade shows that the largest global producers of ethanol are the
U.S. and Brazil; the EU is a net importer. In 2009 estimated data shows that were traded 40 - 50 PJ
of ethanol. Data on trade in ethanol are imprecise because of its multiple uses and lack of
appropriate codes for biofuels in global trade statistics. In 2009, EU states have produced biodiesel
of around 334 PJ (7,04 million tons), the main producers are Germany, France, Spain and Italy
(International Energy Agency).
Production of biodiesel in the European Union represents two thirds of world production of
biodiesel. According to the EAI report, biodiesel trade in 2009 totaled 80 PJ (1,60 million tons)
from a one PJ in 2005.
Import dependence varies between Member States, this being due to uneven spread of
renewable resources. Thus, the Netherlands, Denmark and Britain are major countries producing of
biomass, being the only member states where the ratio of import/export is negative, this being due
and rich endowment of renewable resources and their processing and refining capacity.
3. BARRIERS IN INTERNATIONAL TRADE OF BIOMASS

Over the time the demand for biomass products has increased, which led to an intensification
of international trade, development that was hampered by a number of barriers.
We define a "barrier in international trade in biomass" an issue that may directly or indirectly
affect the development of the biomass trade to final consumers. Thus, although the use of these

Commission's position to achieve by 2020 a level of 10% use of biofuels. They support the idea to
reduce the proportion up to 4% by 2015. Arguments supported by the members of the European
Parliament where about the negative effects of biofuels over the cultivated areas, leading to massive
deforestation, on soil, on water. Other critics have been on the effects of biomass would have it on
food prices, increasing those.
Major obstacles to international trade of biomass can be referred to the tariff, especially
affecting the ethanol trade, while logistical barriers have a greater impact on trade with pellets.
Technical barriers relate to physical and chemical descriptions of fuels, including biofuels, were
introduced to ensure the safety and health of consumers.
To counteract the effects mentioned above, the main importing countries began to develop
biomass national sustainability requirements for bioenergy, which led to the creation of some
systems of certification (voluntary and mandatory) in agriculture, forestry and energy sectors
(European Commission).

CONCLUSION
International trade of biomass produced by the European Union has intensified in recent years
and this upward trend may continue in the future because of growing concern of the EU Member
States regarding the sustainability and the effects that their greenhouse gas emissions have over the
environment. Although there have been many critics over the sustainability of biomass products,
their effects on the environment remain compelling. A step towards a wider application of biomass
should be a more pronounced promotion policy of biofuels and the effects they have on our
environment.
The EU Member States must intensify its efforts to increase investment in the renewable
resources by supporting and encouraging the production of biomass and the adoption of policies
that support production, utilization of renewable energy and providing incentives for biomass
production and consumption at national and local levels.

INTRODUCTION

If we take into account one of the simplest but self speaking theoretical construction of the
classical school of economics, named Crusoe Economics (Rothbard 1998: 29), we learn that
economical practices began as a result of natural labor division and exchange. From the very

is simplified to his instinctive decision making process, necessary to satisfy basic life sustainable
needs. In short, he must learn what, but mainly how to achieve a proper mix of land and labor, in
order to bring his ends and purposes into effect. The picture changes when, in this idyllic society,
another individual has landed. The newcomer, as well as the legendary hero, must mix his labor
with land in order to survive. Naturally, the two lean to attain their ends with minimal effort,
choosing firstly the simplest activities, but as they acquire technological knowledge the end
products are becoming more complex, reaching the point where their production exceeds domestic
consumption. Keeping in mind that their skills and interests differ, they have to shape their
economic activities of production and exchange in accordance with David Ricardo‟s Law of
Comparative Advantage. And this is how, as Rothbard points out, “the process of exchange enables
man to ascend from primitive isolation to civilization” (Rothbard, 1998: 36).
This short story is important mainly because it argues that “economics has revealed a great
truth about the natural law of human interaction: that not only is production essential to man‟s
prosperity and survival, but so also is exchange” (Rothbard 1998: 35). Furthermore, such an
analysis – of the interaction of two people in an uninhabited island, as abstract and simplistic as it
is, makes sense when the spectrum of thought widens to the size and complexity of contemporary
society.
Indeed, production, consumption and especially trade, under classical and neoclassical
economic philosophy, have generated economic growth and social prosperity. But this type of
development tickled a cost of environmental degradation, which over time, became big enough to
jeopardize our wealth and even our existence. The interdependent relationship between economy
and environment have been largely ignored by the neoclassical economists, where in their elegant
economical growth theoretical constructions, the natural environment has not been included.
However, since the early „70s, there were some vices that, through their rigorous studies, began to
draw attention to this issue, many of them speaking even of an imminent environmental,
economical and consequently a wellbeing crisis. A few years later these initiatives have echoed in
the developed world, giving rise to a new paradigm which would link economics with the
environment in a different kind of global development, under the name of sustainable development.
Therefore, eco-efficiency and pollution control quickly became targets for technological research
and development. Meanwhile, trade has adapted to change and – for example – a new international
market of biomass and bio-fuels emerged and quickly expended.

biomass reported to the philosophy of sustainable development. In short, we want to give an answer
to two questions: how much is biomass trade sustainable and what risks may arise if the main
source of energy used today, based on fossil fuels, will be totally substitute by biomass? For doing
this, the paper is organized as follows. The first section will briefly explore for what and for who is
the concept of sustainable development addressing, in order to emphasize on the one hand the
energy dependency of people and on the other hand, the need to change the global optics regarding
the sources through which this energy is produced, optics that embraces the idea of substituting
non-renewable resources with renewable ones in the production process. The following section will
focus on the biomass as an alternative to fossil fuels, on the trend in international trade of biomass –
focusing mainly on European space – the purpose being to capture the dynamics of the demand for
these products and last but not least, to draw the attention on the risks that we might face in the
event that the traditional fuel consumption will be replaced exclusively by biomass.

1. SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT AND BIOMASS

Although environmental issues were put on the carpet two centuries ago prefaced in the
writings of the classical economist Thomas Robert Malthus, in his Essay on the Principle of
Population, the main literature focused on the subject beginning with the decade seven of the last
century, through a series of papers, reports and international conferences, which worth mentio ning:
the club of Rome report, entitled Limits to Growth, published in 1972 by Dennis L. Meadows et al.;
Plan B book series by Lester Brown, founder of the World Watch Institute (WWI) in 1974 and the
Earth Policy Institute in 2001. The most important confe rences gathered representatives from all
over the world to discuss the problems with the environmental - economical and social
relationships, took place in Stockholm (1972), Rio de Janeiro (1992), in Kyoto (1997) and in
Johannesburg in 2002.
All these events have put into the light the environmental issues focusing firstly on the level
of consumption of natural resources, in particular the imminent depletion of the non-renewable ones
in the near future, secondly, on the problems with pollution control and adverse effects of human
activities over environment and biodiversity, and thirdly, on the never-ending bad story of poverty.
The way ahead was outlined and defined in what is called sustainable development in the
Brundtland Report entitled Our Common Future, published in 1987, when the new concept was
defined as “the kind of development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the

development – thus became the common language of economists, ecologists, sociologists,
philosophers and so on – has the task of finding a linkage between the environment and the society
(who exploits it), to improve the degree of compliance between them, in order to be able to continue
growth and development for us and for the ones who will replace those who live today.

1.1. Biomass resources

The influence of international trade over environment and welfare cannot be questioned, the
causal links between these different aspects of life are intimate enough so that any issue caused by
internal or external incentives in the market, finding – with little or no doubt – correspondent effect
in the social and environmental side.
To be sustainable, biomass, which is considered alternative sources of energy, must meet
certain criteria, such as: to possess a high capacity for regeneration, in a relatively short time; to
offer a better efficiency compared with the traditional fossil fuel sources; to be less or nonpolluting, to be used in solid, liquid and gaseous form; to have a broad applicability in production
and consumption; to have a competitive level in terms of costs and prices for transport or storage, in
both stages, as a raw material or as a finished product; to be a good substitute of traditional fuels
(gasoline or diesel), without the necessity for structural changes of the of the engine, etc.
For these reasons, biomass resources appear, in a good extent, to provide a compromise
between utility and eco-efficiency, having a real potential for sustainable energetic development.
The most important biomass energy sources are made of wood and wood waste, agricultural crops
and agricultural byproducts from waste, waste derived from food processing and other plant and
animal waste. Among these, the largest share in manufacturing biomass is wood and wood waste
(64%), municipal solid waste (24%) and agricultural waste (5%) (Demirbas et al. 2009: 1746).
In industrialized nations, biomass is mainly used as a source of fuel used directly or indirectly
(through combinations in different percentages between traditional and bio- fuels). The most used
biofuels are ethanol and biodiesel. The first is produced from several categories of biomass and
used as a substitute for gasoline. It can be used 100% as a transport fuel or mixed with gasoline in
different proportions. Used in blend, ethanol offers the advantage of significant reductions in
petroleum consumption and in greenhouse gas emissions, due to high oxygen concentration.
The second one, biodiesel, can replace diesel in the same way that ethanol replaces (or blends
with) gasoline, except that biodiesel can be used only if changes are made to the engine structure.

rapeseed oil or coconut oil or even recycled cooking oil.
In the European Community, demand for biofuels is growing, and as such, international trade
in these products are, for some time now, on an upward trend, described briefly in the following.

2. INTERNATIONAL TRADE WITH BIOMASS

With the diversification of the economies and growing concern of nations in fighting and
controlling the devastating effects of their gas emissions and in accordance with the gas emission
targets under Kyoto Protocol, the use of biomass has become more tha n necessary. One important
means of achieving this objective is to increase the rate of renewable sources in total of energy
supply. Thus, the European Union proposed, in the Renewable Energy Directive, a minimum of
35% to reduce the gas emissions, in terms of the agricultural and forestry biomass, solid and liquid
biofuels.
Growing demands in energy use and the increase of oil and coal prices have led to the
development of new energy sources such as biomass energy, water energy, solar, wind and
geothermal energy.

In 2008, approximately 18% of the European energy consumption came from renewable
sources, where 70% from those came from traditional biomass production and 9% from hydro
electricity. The new renewable energies (wind, geothermal, solar and biofuels) have a large and
growing area. According to the European Commission, the biomass represents 4% from the EU
energy needs. European Commission Action Plan sets out measures to increase biomass by creating

new opportunities for the developing countries (European Commission).
The literature review reveals that Latin America, Sub Saharan Africa and Eastern Europe,
North-East Asia and Oceania will be the most important biomass producers in the long term, while
the main demand will be found in OECD countries and Asia South East, which means that one of
the most important role trade will be played by biomass (Heinimo and Junginger 2009: 1311). As
the demand for biomass products is increasing, and international sales market is in developing,
these resources are unequal distributed in different parts of the world, the biomass trade is in a
continuous growth among the European Union countries.
According to the European Commission reports, the EU is a net importer, in the present the
rate of energy import dependency is 54%, and while in 2020 is expected to lead to an addiction rate
of 70% if no measures will be taken to increase production of domestic energy. Although fossil
fuels can‟t be replaced with renewable resources, it can be taken to combine them with those from
renewable resources in order to obtain the desired effect, which is reducing the gas emissions
(Magar et al. 2010: 2).
The European Union is far from being the largest producer of biomass; it must then rely on
imports, becoming a net importer. Thus, ethanol, vegetable oils, firewood, coal and wood pellets are
the most important products which are currently the most traded energy purposes. They may be
imported and used in their unprocessed shape or can be used as raw materials, in terms to be
exported. In the mentioned period (Table no. 2.) reflects the rate of imports dependence of
European Union, emphasizing it in 2008.

In 2008, primary production of biomass was 188 756 TJ higher than the previous year, this
upward trend mainly thanks to the growing importance of biomass energy.
Although the European Union is a net importer of energy, biomass imports are relatively
small. In 2008, imports of biomass were 2,4% of total primary supply, and according IEA, in2009
they have raised to a level of 4,5% of total primary supply (International Energy Agency).

of around 334 PJ (7,04 million tons), the main producers are Germany, France, Spain and Italy

Production of biodiesel in the European Union represents two thirds of world production of
biodiesel. According to the EAI report, biodiesel trade in 2009 totaled 80 PJ (1,60 million tons)
from a one PJ in 2005.
