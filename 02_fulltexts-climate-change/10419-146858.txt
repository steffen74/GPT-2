Introduction
It has been proven through many studies that local sustainable economic development is
promoted through various initiatives that link universities, government and industries
(UGI) (Etzkowitz and Leydesdorff, 1995; 2000) leading to the creation of science parks
(Afonso et al., 2010). Countries which have not advanced in linking the three (UGI) have
yet to realize that although scientific research can be powerful, it is not the only organized
human activity that produces sustainable innovation ecosystems relevant to the development of viable economic policies that meets societal needs (Gibbons et al.,
1994; Carayannis and Campbell 2006). It is an almost common consensus that development arises as a result of cooperating and strategically consulting specialized
productive units that are complementary. Since the 2000s, a series of new ways
regarding models for sustaining innovation systems has taken place in order to accommodate global networking. This has been enhanced by the need for food

safety, green energy and other international agreements caused by technological advances and the speeding up of access to resources (Powell and Grodal, 2005).
The triple helix innovation model based on strategic interactions of UGI has played
both integrated and overlapping roles for the benefit and sustainability of economic development in many countries. Analysis showed that economies where the triple helix
has been operational had knowledge-based development and have created industries
that are innovation-driven. Moreover, the universities in these countries have spurred
technology-intensive research (Etzkowitz and Klofsten, 2005). There have been several
advances in the triple helix model due to the need to maximize the benefits realized by
the mutual interaction of the integrated innovation ecosystem.
There has been a problem in advancing and sustaining technological development in
developing countries especially in Africa. This has made them lag behind in stimulating
innovations needed to either compete in global markets or to make their higher education
relevant to market demands. This paper examines critically some of the perceived knowledge gaps which most developing countries have not cracked in understanding the
drivers of the technological edge. The paper goes back in the primordial stages and systematically outlines the evolution of these changes and discusses the crucial role of each
stage of interaction. We suggest that the growth of each stage in the triple helix as it advances to quad helix is very important for establishing a sustainable developmental ecosystem. Furthermore, each stage should advisedly be implemented. There are factors that
have contributed to these interaction changes, for example, Leydesdorff and Sun (2009)
reported that in Japan the government, university and industry relations had actually
started to decline, because of differences in strategic intentions. This was much more conspicuous in the university-industry collaborations. However, there have been explicit policies to stimulate these relations and some have succeeded. Furthermore, analysis of the
quadruple helix concept showed that it is not yet a very well-established concept in
innovation research and policy in some countries (Arnkil et al., 2010), but its adoption
and implementation seem that it is becoming increasingly paramount in a globalized society. The objective of this work is to highlight and explain the past developments of the
GUI interactions and how they are imperative in sustainable development of a country.

Review
The interactions of the triple helix innovative model in Third World Countries

The governments, universities and industries in the third world countries, especially in
Africa, have not been creating new business opportunities and have passively been
watching as former famous industries head to oblivion. They are also not fostering
entrepreneurship, and hence, hardly are they having a mechanism of generating
knowledge-based jobs. Much money has been spent in trying to discover what could be
the cause of this situation. But, it is now becoming increasingly clear that this has been
caused by lack or little interaction between the government, universities and industries.
They in fact practically work in independent silos as shown in Fig. 1.

How the triple helix works is operating in the middle-income nations

In the middle-income countries, the governments are making demands for universities to participate and contribute to long-term strategic plans for the countries. This

with no meaningful interactions. It seems to be a kind of silo confinement for each institution

has made governments and universities sign annual performance contracts, and reciprocally, the universities have demanded the government to provide the necessary
technological infrastructure. It seems that at this stage the governments are at crossroads to either be competitive in international markets or lose the support of former
donors. Hence, the governments in a bid to keep afloat are pushing the industries to
brand their economies with innovative products and create employment for the growing populations. This has made them start negotiations with local industries and at
the same time attract investments in order to create jobs and competitive products.
On the other hand, the industries have also demanded for a better innovative environment with friendly taxes and better marketing infrastructure. This kind of economic push and technological pull has made interactions between government,
universities and industries begin to be established (see Fig. 2). It is not an easy
process to initiate, but logic has shown that it is the only way for a sustainable competitive economic growth which is mutually beneficial.

technological advancement


The triple helix in the developed nations

The operation of the triple helix in the developed countries has actually matured in
bringing the governments, universities and industries closer over the years. This has
made them identify cross-cutting issues which none of them can adequately deal with
individually. These common issues include energy, information technology and communication (ICT) and transport. The commonality of the challenge has brought them
together so as to find sustainable innovative ways of tackling them. In many cases, they
ended up identifying a physical place close to the universities to meet regularly for innovative discussions. This venue for representative experts was in many places globally
called a science park. The concept has matured over decades in many countries and
has been the source of great innovations. For example, the Bluetooth technology
innovation, and its marketing which is common in computers and mobile phones, was
developed by the Lund University, Sweden, based on this interactive background. This
is basically the technological secret of developed countries. The innovations in these
countries have greatly increased because of these interactions and have made big
technological cities called technopolis and later innopolis.
The governments in these countries fund strategic research in universities as
demanded by the need for new products in industries and the need to create jobs. The
outcome usually makes them more globally competitive. Although the science park is
mainly the main outcome or focus of such interactions, we also have other dual peripheral interactions in the triple helix components (see Fig. 3).

The evolution of triple helix at the globalization scale

The triple helix has benefited industries by enabling them to obtain informed labour
from universities by linking market demands to experts in the field and obtaining sustainable licensing agreements. The governments have been able to initiate new industries and new products leading to more jobs for citizens. They also have gotten more
taxes and duties leading to a higher status of living and economic development. The
universities have benefited from the science parks by getting reliable sources of funding
from industry and government and better training in industry-related research good for

on cross-cutting issues from the science park (indicated as red). This kind of interaction is the basis and
sustainable strategy for technological innovation necessary for creating local jobs and maintaining international
product competitiveness in markets



quicker job placements. They also have been able to do research which is based on
national and global needs.
The inclusion of the Internet has made the world become so small especially after
the increase and the impact of the service sector in economic development. This has
led to globalization. There are clear benefits of globalization like the provision of a
platform for advocacy of human rights and safety which have to be addressed in the
economic interactions of the triple helix. But, the citizens or users cannot directly always voice their informed concerns to the government, universities or industries, but a
strengthened civil society has been suggested to be much better placed to play the
watchdog in the now well-established link between government, universities and
industries.
The number of industries and subsectors in a science park always increase, and they
end up in the formation of clusters for effective and efficient innovation of products.
Therefore, there is need for a specialized body of personnel or think tank to evaluate
the sustainability of some of the advances in technology based on economic, social and
environmental impacts in various settings. This inclusion of the civil society has made
us to suggest the inclusion of the civil society as a fourth component in the triple helix,
making a quad helix (see Fig. 4).

The development of technological incubators

Normally, universities have a local system of producing their own commercial products.
Their system is linear, and it includes the doing of research, publishing of findings,
patenting of innovations, making of prototypes and then finally making products for industries. This process is normally abbreviated as RPPP, to represent the following:
Research, Publish, Patents, Prototype and Product. These products are then expected
to be incubated. The role of incubators is to provide an environment for the crossfertilization of technology, marketing and innovation. The incubators provide insights
into modalities of management, scalability and marketability logistics for the product in

Fig. 4 The advancement of the triple helix to include the civil society as the fourth component makes a
quad helix. This inclusion aids in raising the voice of the user of the innovations so as to cater for mainly
the social and environmental needs on a global scale. This is because, although for the sake of the global
market and product competitions, we are bound to think globally but should always act locally



the society. A researcher who has undergone incubation process with his or her product is capable of creating jobs and marketing new technologies and is able to build
national and international economies. However, although this is absolutely possible, it
is not sustainable and it cannot create jobs and products which are globally competitive.
Hence, there is need for universities in developing countries and middle-income countries
to make a paradigm shift and begin to invest in science park-based innovation models as
it is taking place in developed countries.

Discussions and conclusions
In a knowledge-based system, it is possible to transform products analytically and innovatively so as to make them seem as new products. For example, although the
Netherlands does not produce tomatoes, it has become a major exporter of tomatoes
due to its strategic innovativeness. Most of the developing countries and those which
are even referred to as poor nations also have great entrepreneurs; by this, we mean
people who can think and come up with ideas to solve community problems. Therefore, we should encourage them to be ready to launch their ideas and be absolutely responsible for the inherent risks and outcomes. The provision of the necessary
infrastructure can provide proactive guidance to deal with the risks involved therein.
Someone may ask, so if developing countries have had entrepreneurs, why has economic development been very slow? What has been the problem? We suggest that the
problem has been how to put the operational institutions in strategic venues for a sustainable innovation ecosystem. The above analysis makes an outline how the innovative
models have evolved since their inception in the 1930s, when the idea of “science park”
was coined in the USA.
The introduction of the civil society in the triple helix
Later studies suggested the insufficiency of the triple helix in long-term sustainable innovative growth and then suggested an addition of a fourth helix, called the civil society
(Lijemark, 2004; Khan and Al-Ansari, 2005). Studies suggested that the fourth helix
could include faith-based organizations (FBO), non-governmental organizations
(NGO), etc. which could combine funding from governmental with the community and
private donors (Delman and Madsen, 2007). The civil society serves as the voice of the
citizen and could make development to be more human-sensitive and in the cultural
context of the communities. Some researchers had chosen the user as the fourth helix
of the quad helix. But they confessed that the “user-driven” is problematic as it suggests
a bigger role to the user than what there actually often exists. Another recent suggestion was to include a model called “the citizen-centered”. It focused on the development of innovations that are relevant and safe for citizens (Arnkil et al., 2010).
However, the citizens are hardly able to know the procedures for getting the government and citizen to legally listen to their voices; hence, a strong civil society becomes a
very important component for the triple helix. The interactions between the four helices could be varied (Etzkowitz and Leydesdor, 2000). Studies show that the four helices
form what is referred to as ecosystems of innovation (Afonso et al., 2010). This shows
innovative ideas passing from one source and perfected on a different platform can be
supported by another source. New processes or products could start from national
innovation demands or by creative citizens.



The Internet and globalized economies
The international outlook of products and processes shall give an edge in global economic competition. Globalization shall make the international-national dimension of
operation become increasingly relevant (Wagner, 2008). The Internet has caused the
service sector to play a major role in economic development in many countries. We
are not suggesting that the quad helix is the ultimate, but we are open to new ideas
which can make the interaction among government, universities and industries become
profitability closer. We have complex issues to deal with in the different sectors in the
science parks. Hence, the creation and simulation of better synergies among economy,
society, environment, and democracy in the digital era might take its use to other
levels.
