levels: the society and the company. It is easy to find what the societal benefits are – they
respond to public needs. On the other side, what are the main benefits for companies? First
of all, the most important it’s to differentiate themselves from competitors. Why this?
Nowadays, tourists are more informed and more concerned about different aspects such as
environment or health. Moreover, markets are crowded and companies have been forced to
find new ways to build connections with consumers. Therefore, Corporate Social
Responsibility programs are the perfect way for companies to communicate their values.
Secondly, and also as a result, Corporate Social Responsibility programs help companies to
improve their reputation. It’s known that the success depends on the confidence of
stakeholders – community, local authorities, and media – consequently, if a company
demonstrates its responsibility, reputation grows. Among other benefits for companies the
following are included: Corporate Social Responsibility programs helps to grow sales,
revenues and market, attracts and keeps valuable employees, innovation and learning,
reputation, media opportunities through ethical business activities.
As a result, for tourism businesses, there are a lot of benefits in adopting a CSR approach.
Developing and promoting CSR for tourism companies is essentials in order to support this
sector sustainability. Why?
• SME’s are largely represented in the travel and tourism sector;
• Tourism SME’s have strong relationships with local communities;
• Tourism SME’s have an important influence on the socio-economic development of
the regions where they operate.
This research is aimed to analyse tourism operators’ opinions relating to Corporate Social
Responsibility situation within European micro, small and medium sized enterprises. It is
greatly significant to see the output of this research when it comes to emphasize the
importance of CSR in tourism businesses.

Literature review

1.1. Defining SME and CSR
In Romania, according to Law no. 346/2004 updated art 3. „Small and medium enterprises
are defined as those which satisfy the following conditions:
• Have an annual average number of employees less than 250;
• Make an annual net turnover of 50 million euros, RON equivalent, or total assets not
exceeding the equivalent in RON of EUR 43 million, according to the latest financial
statements approved” (Law no. 346/2004).
Also, it is specified in paragraph 5, turnover threshold can be modified by Government
Decision depending on evolution in macroeconomic indicators.
In Article 4 of the same law, SMEs are classified as follows:
• “Micro enterprises - have up to 9 employees and an annual net turnover or total assets
of up to 2 million euros, RON equivalent;
• Small enterprises - have between 10 and 49 employees and an annual net turnover or
total assets of up to 10 million euros, RON equivalent;

• Medium enterprises - have between 50 and 249 employees and an annual net turnover
of 50 million euros, RON equivalent, or total assets not exceeding the equivalent in RON of
EUR 43 million” (Law no. 346/2004).
Moreover, Romania has harmonized its legislation with the EU legislation, according to the
recommendation 2003/361/CE of European Commission from 6 May 2003, which defines
SMEs and establishes the criteria by which they are distinguished from other companies:
number of employees, turnover or total balance sheet. So, the definition of SMEs according
to the European Commission is “the category of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises
(SMEs) is made up of enterprises which employ fewer than 250 persons and which have an
annual turnover not exceeding 50 million euro, and/or an annual balance sheet total not
exceeding 43 million euro” - Extract of Article 2 of the Annex of Recommendation
2003/361/EC (European Commission, 2003).
In the global context, although it is difficult to adopt a universal - accepted definition, we
mention two approaches, broadly similar:
• According Oxford dictionary, “small to medium-sized enterprise, a company with no
more than 500 employees” (Oxford Dictionary, 2015);
• In their paper “Defining SMEs: A Less Imperfect Way of Defining Small and
Medium Enterprises in Developing Countries”, Tom Gibson and H. J. van der Vaartindeed
suggest a less imperfect formula: An SME is a formal enterprise with annual turnover, in
U.S. dollar terms, of between 10 and 1000 times the mean per capita gross national income,
at purchasing power parity, of the country in which it operates” (Kushnir, 2010).
In the European Commission's Communication 681 of 25 October 2011, CSR is defined as
“the responsibility of enterprises for their impacts on society” (European Commission,
2011). Although the concept of CSR has a known and widely applied meaning, if we
approach CSR through the SME’s, we can consider the definition of Social Responsibility,
as it appears in international standard – ISO 26000 (2010): “Social responsibility is the
responsibility of an organization for the impacts of its decisions and activities on society
and the environment, through transparent and ethical behaviour that: contributes to
sustainable development, including health and the welfare of society; takes into account the
expectations of stakeholders; is in compliance with applicable law and consistent with
international norms of behaviour; and is integrated throughout the organization and
practiced in its relationships”.
In the context of the close relationship between CSR and Sustainable Development, we
could take into consideration the definition of World Business Council for Sustainable
Development: "Corporate Social Responsibility is the continuing commitment by business
to contribute to economic development while improving the quality of life of the workforce
and their families as well as of the community and society at large” (World Business
Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), 2015a; 2015b).
Further, in a recent study on CSR in Romania, the concept of Social Responsibility it is
characterized as „responsible entrepreneurship, complying with legal requirements and
international standards applicable, seeks to increase positive contribution to all stakeholders
while minimizing the negative impact, through the voluntary initiatives beyond legal and
contractual requirements who are proactive and take place regularly, not randomly” (Anca
et al., 2011).

reports:
• The World Bank (2015a; 2015b; 2015c) has developed a model of best practice on
corporate governance, publishing also reports on public policies or implementation of CSR
in the global value chain;
• OECD (2015) published studies on Principles of Corporate Governance, but also in
transparency and ethics in business for multinational companies.
The specialized literature is very rich on this unquestionable and relevant topic, starting
from simple definitions or conceptual clarifications to complex economic and social
approaches. Without claiming an exhaustive literature review, we highlight here the
existence of extensive debate of the concept itself, sometimes contradictory, given that the
moral foundations of the concept of social responsibility are not clear or agreed
unanimously (Frederick, 2006). Moreover, some authors consider that there is not an
universally accepted definition of CSR because it address different dimensions of social
responsibility, often in an unbalanced way and a comparison of the definitions becomes
very difficult (Dahlsrud, 2006).
Some approaches highlight the connection between social responsibility and sustainable
development, analyzing the relationship in a double sense and stressing that the common
elements is not limited to the relationship with the environment, but also covers the
relationship with all categories of stakeholders, through so-called "social training"
suggested by the concept of sustainability (Tovey, 2009; Dernbach and Mintz, 2011).
In recent years, several studies highlight the importance of CSR not only for big companies
but also for SMEs and even for public institutions (Jenkins, 2006; Murillo and Lozano,
2006; Jamali and Mirshak, 2006, Perrini, Russo and Tencati 2007). Even if it is still in an
early stage of research, these studies already generate a great interest in literature, but also
in practice.
1.2. SME’s social responsibility in tourism
In many cases, wrongly, SMEs are overlooked in terms of CSR, and this happens because
major companies have the volume of information, tools and, maybe, motivations in order to
create their responsible business image: “Does this mean that CSR does not apply in such
cases? No. Every company bears a share of responsibility, which it must assume, however
small” (Argandona, 2010). Experts from United Nation and World Tourism Organization,
appreciate, in a study, that “in companies, the concept of Corporate Social Responsibility
(CSR) means adopting transparent business practices that are based on ethical values. It has
started to gain ground and many companies already include social and environmental
commitments in their core mission statements” (UNEP-WTO, 2005).
CSR in the tourism industry responds to issues particularly related to promoting sustainable
tourism practices. However, although interest in sustainable tourism is high and theme very
debated nowadays, use of codes of conduct and are not yet widespread, CSR in tourism and
still searching for consistency in policies, programs and practices.
In a representative study (Dodds and Joppe, 2005), authors outlining the main directions
and measures that can meet the objectives of CSR in tourism (table no. 1).

General

- Gradually comply with international standards and perceived as being suitable by
local and international operators;
- Include quality along with environmental and social criteria in guidelines,
reporting and accreditation endeavours;
- Urge associations to harmonize and apply guidelines;
- Develop industry-specific and extensive guidelines and charters;
- Implement the current certification framework; but still to continue building a
brand around local community action and actions aimed at CSR so as businesses
perceive it as a functional business activity;
- Associate development funds with CSR criteria in order for developers and
managers to have a long term target for their products’ life span.

Governments

- Ratify and enforce sustainable supply-chain initiatives;
- Inform with respect to corporate social responsibility initiatives;
- Assent to certification or to the use of certified products with the help of their
partners in the supply chain.
- Formulate appropriate structures for investments so as to promote and stimulate
tourism destinations in the sense of sustainable development;
- Urge industry associations to give details with respect to the way in which they
manage to attain more sustainable tourism;
- Elaborate laws on corporate social reporting;
- Elaborate laws for or incentivise businesses that enforce certification schemes
recognised on an international level or standards on a national level.

Tuan (2011) also supports the authorities' important role in the development of CSR in the
tourism industry level, among them including support public-private partnerships, exchange
of best practices, encouraging industry associations to join the sustainable and responsible
tourism policies.
Taking as a case study the CSR in tourism experience of Spain, Argandona (2010) answers
to the question „how can CSR help solve the problems of companies or groups of
companies operating in the tourism industry?”, pointing out several suggestions for them:
companies must to know their responsibility, develop a culture of responsibility in strong
collaboration with other stakeholders, and, more important, they must have long-term
vision about social responsibility.

Methodology overview

The research methodology complies with international standards and it is aimed to assess
the opinions of tour operators with respect to CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility) from
the perspective of European micro, small and medium enterprises. The results of this study
are relevant for the chosen topic.
Regarding the method for gathering the information, we used a questionnaire of
21 questions. The design of the information collection took into account the fact that
tourism operators from micro, small and medium sized enterprise were the observation unit,
while the sampling unit was a randomised selection of respondents, compiling the
comprised of micro, small and medium sized enterprises in tourism from EU. The research
was made between March and December 2015 and the researched community was
composed by 350 persons represents SME's tourism enterprises. The sample size was
elaborated using simple random unrepeatable sampling. The model was chosen with a 95%
probability coefficient consequent to z = 1.96 and the conventional error limit of 5%.
Taking into account that previous research regarding these argument are not existing, the
maximum dispersion has been used in calculating which is f(1-f) = 0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25, thus
resulting the sample size of 310 questionnaires. SPSS software was utilized in processing
the data. Out of 350 persons surveyed, only 305 were valid responses. Therefore, these
results can be extrapolated absolutely to the entire community.

Environment-friendly travels (standard deviation 0.9492), but there should be an emphasis
on the mean of 4.09 and a median of 4.00, meaning that subjects have a relatively different
perception with respect to the importance of this criterion, but it is placed on the highest
level (5 – very important). There are a great number of responses granting a high level of
importance to the all criteria (mode value 5 and 4).
Addressing the importance factor correlated with the motivation indicators when attending

Concerning the future orientation on CSR of SMEs surveyed, the results reveal following
aspects:
• 175 respondents (60.1% from the valid answers) want to extend its CSR activities in
the near future, while 116 respondents (39.9% from the valid answers) do not;
• The most important method for implementing CSR is specialised support (training,
know how), followed by sponsorships, donations, employee volunteers, institutional
scholarships, providing aid (products etc.).

Conclusions
According to distribution of results, we can appreciate the following characteristics of the
investigated sample:
• Most of the companies are sole trader and private limited, operate at international
level, but also local;
• Most of the respondents are travel agents or working in the hotel industry;
• Most of the companies are micro-enterprises, no matter if we refer to the number of
employees or turnover.
Considering that approximately two-thirds of respondents included in the study reported
that Corporate Social Responsibility is a familiar concept to them, it should be pointed out
that the majority of those who chose the predefined version of the answers describe CSR as
being a voluntary action performed by a company for the benefit of the community (the
most important term being voluntary, precisely as European documents describe this
concept).
Regarding the vision of respondents on the economic role of companies, this is the
provision of goods and services, making profit and welfare and economic growth, in
compliance with ethical standards. So, strengthen this vision, related to the relation between
different dimensions of development, most of the respondents are agree and totally agree
that besides profit orientation, a tourism enterprise should be actively involved in the
development of the communities where they operate.
On the role of the company in society, there are some aspects to underline: company's
reputation, CSR domains, methods used, motivation for CSR, criteria in creating a fair
tourism product. So, for a good reputation, products and services are essential, and only
after that trust and transparency or values and beliefs. The sample investigated considers
that companies should dedicate CSR programs in the following areas: research and product
development, education, environmental protection, preserving art and culture, benefits and
employee development. The usual methods by which companies contribute to society are
specialised support through training programs, know how transfer, but also sponsorships,
donations and employee volunteers. Regarding the motivation for companies to meet the
challenges related to CSR, beyond the voluntary principle, there are attracts and keeps good
employees, PR – marketing programmes and competitive advantage. The criteria in
creating a fair tourism product in tourism industry are: paying adequate prices, respecting
labour standards, carefully selecting accommodation, involving local communities and
travelling in an environmentally friendly manner.
