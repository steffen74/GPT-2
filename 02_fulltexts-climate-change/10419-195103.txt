Introduction
The current rapid technological change has seen facilitation of constant as well as unpredictable change in the desires customers have. This can be justified by how constantly customers
abandon their outdated models in order to adopt and cope with new and emerging ones.
However, it has been established that advances in technology have been at the center of
increased diminished product life cycle. The result of this impact of the life cycle of products
has led to an upsurge in their rate of disposal.
With the rise in the disposal rates, effects can be felt through strain expressed by earth’s
natural resources as well as landfill areas which have begun to reach their acute peak. It is
therefore a significant idea that manufacturing firms should play significant roles in helping to
manage the outdated technological products. This can be done by a mechanism where these
manufacturing firms are compelled by law to ensure that they recall technological devices
which have antiquated. Such initiatives will not only work to enhance their customers’
awareness about pertinent issues of environment but also promote these entities ability to meet
the new regulations which have been imposed on them. It is important that these manufacturing
entities come up with special facilities that are designed to handle as well as recover their
products which have reached their end of lives. Developing such facilities is viewed to be
impactful in the initiative set to reduce the amount of mechanical waste that is disposed on the
landfills. The initiative can be made possible by encouraging the process of recovering these
mechanical materials, parts as well as components from products considered to have reached
their end-of-lives. The process of recovery can be conducted in diverse ways; some of these
include refurbishing of the products in order to make them useful again, recycling them as well
as taking them through a remanufacturing process in order to develop as good as new product
from them. Such facilities used for handling end-of-use products (EOUPs) have outstanding
commercial benefits. This is because it makes the whole process of making products with
diminished life to be recovered to have greater relevance and become more appealing.
In the process of product recovery, most facilities undertaking this work utilize one major
operation known as the disassembly operation [40]. This operation is seen to be at the heart of
product recovery facility mainly because of its capacity to enhance extraction of desired
components from products whose life span has expired. The same process is capable of
enhancing a sub assembling process in order to come up with useful materials from EOUPs.
In order to enhance the disassembling operation several mechanisms can be utilized in order to

21

Nevertheless the distinction in these mechanisms is based on the amount of yield that each
is capable of producing from the EOUPs. It is, therefore established that among the three
utilization of a disassembling line emerges to be the most efficient since it is capable to
increase the yields obtained from the operation. On the other hand the utilization of single
workstation together with disassembly cells are considered to be useful due to their flexibility
nature [12]. Disassembly is perceived as an operation that is focused on ensuring that an EOUP
is deconstructed down to its core mechanical component. This is achievable because the
process makes use of three crucial techniques [19]. These techniques are destructive, semidestructive as well as non-destructive ones. The main goal why manufacturers carry out
disassembling process is to help ensure that recovery process of products is enhanced hence
limited dependency on natural resources for their continued operations.
Despite its effectiveness in ensuring that product recovery is enhanced, this process is faced
with one uncertainty. That is the possibility of the product quality may have been compromised. This problem is enhanced by the fact that before disassembling most entities do not
have informative as well as solid information about the condition of the product that is being
disassembled. However this can be countered by promoting individual sample testing prior to
disassembling. Despite the capacity to counter this uncertainty through prior testing. It has
been established that mechanical disassembly always subjects entities that utilizes it to
financial damping particularly of their profits. This consequently has the impact of reducing
the profit margin of manufacturers. The profit margin distinction is presumed to be influenced
by two major factors and that is, monetary cost of carrying out appropriate as well as required
testing on the product as well as magnitude of time demanded to enhance that process. At
times it emerges that the product is dysfunctional hence resulting to extra cost due to waste of
valuable resources.
Apart from the above challenges encountered, it is evident that the quality of product
obtained from the process induces customers’ hesitation. This influenced by question of
efficiency as well as reliability of the product. There is always a cloud of uncertainty on
capability of the product manufactured to offer services comparable to new one. This level of
uncertainty can influence consumers’ decision not to purchase the product. Due to this doubt,
manufacturers are always compelled to conduct expensive mechanism to ease consumer
apprehension such as devising various marketing strategies that involves warranty provisions
[4]. This approach is seen to help in affirming durability of such products as well as taking care
of consumer security [33].
On this line it has been established that, to counter uncertainties associated disassembly
yields, utilization of sensor-embedded products (SEPs) is an approach with a great future. This
approach works in a way that a sensor is implemented into a product when it is manufactured.
This sensor therefore will facilitate product monitoring as well as enhancing data collection
[47, 51]. This data is critical in establishing potential failure of the product in the future. This is
possible because the sensors are capable of providing the necessary information about the
current conditions of the components of a given product during its End-of-use (EOU) stage.
Further the data that might be collected particularly about dysfunctioning, replacements as well
as missing components prior to such products disassembling is crucial as it enhances savings

various warranty analyzed models. This will take accounts of information in different
manufacturing scenarios. The study will focus on trying to reduce the cost associated with
warranty while aiming at increasing the profits that is gained from remanufacturing. This will
be done by calculating warranty with an appealing price.
EOU products and required components arrive at remanufacturing facilities in accordance
with the Poisson distribution. The disassembly and remanufacturing times exponentially
assigned to each station are distributed accordingly [22]. The imposed cost for backorders
will be calculated based on the duration of the backorder. Excessive and unessential EOU
products and components are disposed of regularly according to a stringent disposal policy. A
pull control production mechanism is used in all disassembly line settings considered and
reviewed in this research study. Lastly the comparison of warranty costs and temporal periods
are made amongst different warranty policies.
The contribution of this paper is basically founded on its capacity to present a quantitative
evaluation of the effect that provision of warranty has on manufactured items. This is with
focus on a manufacturers` perspective while maintaining their desire to ensure that they offer
prices that attract buyers. Despite the fact that studies have been conducted on warranty
policies on both brand new products as well as secondhand ones, there is a critical gap on
the availability about benefits of warranties on remanufactured products in a comprehensive
and quantitative manner. In the existing studies, the profit improvements achieved by offering
warranties for different policies determine the range of how much money can be invested in a
warranty while still keeping it profitable overall.

Background
This section provides a literature review on the issues considered in this research. First, a brief
review on environmentally conscious manufacturing and product recovery is presented. There
are two important review papers that are available in the literature and are directly related to the
subject area of this paper. The first one is the state of the art survey paper by Gungor and Gupta
[11] covering papers in Environmentally Conscious Manufacturing and Product Recovery
(ECMPRO) published through 1998. The second one is also the state of the art survey paper in
the same area covering papers published between 1998 and 2010 by Ilgin and Gupta [17].
Together, they classified more than 870 papers (330 and 540 respectively) under four main
categories, viz. environmentally conscious product design, reverse and closed-loop supply
chains, remanufacturing and disassembly. Then, a section on warranty analysis is presented
and related literature is highlighted.

Environmentally conscious manufacturing and product recovery
Researchers [11, 14] have recently given more attention to manufacturing practices and
product recovery (ECMPRO) issues that take environmental consciousness into account.
While factors such as regulatory influences, environmental changes, and public interest have
influenced this research, this interest has also arisen because of reverse logistics, product

difficulty that product manufacturers face in pursuit of environmentally friendly practices,
researchers have reviewed the plethora of challenges that emerge in the sustainable
manufacturing and product recovery process (see for example, [13, 23, 32, 34]). Given the
key role that disassembly plays in recovery, research has paid particular attention to this step in
remanufacturing. (For further detail on the disassembly process, see [28].)

Warranty analysis
Manufacturers (vendors/sellers) create contractual agreements called warranties when selling
their products. Warranties exist to hold these manufacturers liable for products that in rare
instances do not perform, or prematurely cease in performing, their agreed-upon function. The
product’s intended purpose is delineated in the warranty, as well as specifications on promised
performance and how customers will be compensated in the event that the product does not
meet these specifications [6]. Product warranties can serve one or multiple functions, including: providing insurance and protection so that the manufacturer/seller absorbs the risk of
product failure or malfunction [8, 15]; ensure buyers of a product’s reliability [7, 9, 38, 48, 49];
or allow a seller to leverage the protection of a warranty for additional profits at the point of
sale [30].
While a variety of literature has discussed the implications of new product warranties, little
attention has been given to warranties administered for secondhand items. Furthermore,
limited research has been performed on warranty cost analyses on remanufactured products.
Saidi-Mehrabad et al. [41] and Shafiee et al. [44] have presented the ideal upgrade strategies
for used items using screening test reliability development methods and a stochastic model
intended to examine secondhand item sellers’ optimal investments for increasing product
reliability using free repair warranty (FRW) policies. Their research suggests a positive
correlation between an increased number of investments, declines in virtual age, and increases
in reliability levels for the products receiving these investments. Shafiee et al. [45] developed a
stochastic reliability improvement model for secondhand products with warranties, as well as a
Cobb-Douglas-Type production function to determine optimal upgrade levels. Naini and
Shafiee [35] conducted research to pinpoint optimal upgrades, selling prices, and maximum
expected profits while applying restrictive assumptions regarding age distribution; this study
created a mathematical model that detected and determined the best policies by applying
parametric analysis on an item’s chronological age. Yazdian et al. [53] created an additional,
integrated mathematical model to determine typical remanufacturing decisions without relying
on a received item’s specific age. Liao et al. [29] studied warranty policies from consumer
perspectives, as well as their impacts on consumer behavior. According to Alqahtani and
Gupta [1], remanufacturers can utilize Free Replacement Warranty (FRW) and Pro-Rata
Warranty (PRW) policies to create base and extended one-dimensional warranties for
remanufactured products. EOU-derived products, on the other hand, can offer renewable,
nonrenewable, one- and two-dimensional warranties. The warranty effect on remanufacturing
facilities need further investigation [2].

Maintenance analysis

intended function and maintenance is needed to return them to an operational state. PM occurs
before full-fledged product failure occurs as a preventative measure to reduce failure rates and
deterioration. If a product only carries a short amount of remaining life, a warranty may cover a
shorter time period and only offer CM. Conversely, if products carry a long remaining life,
warranties may extend for longer periods and offer PM to reduce warranty servicing costs.
Thus, a relationship exists between product life, warranty time frames, CM, and PM.
Extensive literature has commented on maintenance policies, with several published
reviews on the topic [10, 46, 52]. Nakagawa [36] provides more detailed information beyond
this paper on maintenance theory, and additional publications by Nakagawa [37] supply
extensive commentary on modeling maintenance policies.
Comparatively, research has given little interest to warranty-based maintenance policies for
secondhand products [43]. Two periodical age reduction PM models have been proposed by
Yeh et al. [54] to reduce high failure rates among secondhand products. In the event of expired
warranties, Kim et al. [27] research suggested periodic PM policies for secondhand items. To
preserve manufacturer profitability, it is recommended that producers only allow PM on
secondhand items when savings from the warranty service cost exceeds additional costs
incurred by providing PM on the items. Additional research on developing ideal PM policies
for remanufactured products is warranted [3].

System description
This study employed discrete-event simulation (DES) to determine the optimal strategy for
implementing a two-dimensional renewing warranty policy for secondhand or remanufactured
products. Discrete event simulation (DES) is a method of capturing the behavior and performance of a real-life process, facility or system. The increasing speed and memory of modern
computers have allowed the technique to be applied to problems of increasing size and
complexity. DES models the system as a series of ‘events’ [e.g. a warranty claim arrived, a
preventive maintenance performed, a product or component demand met] that occur over time.
DES assumes no change in the ARTO system between events. DES allows many ‘what if?’
scenarios to be tested. This allows remanufacturers (decision-makers) to test and better
understand alternative ways in which a new policy may be best met. In DES, remanufactured
products are modelled as independent entities each of which can be given associated attribute
information. This may include parameters such as remaining life of each component, historical
maintenance, age, weight, warranty type, warranty validity, previous claims and current
condition (functioning or nonfunctioning). DES thus allows complex decision logic to be
incorporated that is not as freely possible in other types of modelling. We illustrate this
implementation using the Advanced Remanufacturing-To-Order (ARTO) system, a specific
type of product recovery system. To understand the system’s reaction to various experimental
conditions, the experiments we deployed in this study utilized Taguchi’s Orthogonal Arrays to
simulate the entire domain of the recovery system. Pairwise t-tests, one-way analysis of
variance (ANOVA), and Tukey pairwise comparison tests were used to analyze warranty
and preventative maintenance scenarios to determine a manufacturer’s potential optimum
strategies.

in a recovery process as shown in Fig. 1. To meet quality and manufacturing demands for the
WM and satisfy internal and external component demands, the refurbishing and repair process
may call for using recycled parts. The ARTO system classifies item arrivals into three different
categories: EOU products designated for the recovery process, failed SEP with the need to
rectify, or SEP due for maintenance.
To continue with the WM example, EOU WMs would first pass through the ARTO system
where a radio frequency data reader in the facility’s database would scan products and retrieve key
information. Following this scan, WMs enter a disassembly line that separates components in a
six-step process of total disassembly. WMs are made of nine key components: the metal cover,
control panel, agitator, spin tub, motor, pump, water and train hoses, pulley, and transmission, as
Fig. 2 illustrates. Station disassembly times, interarrival times of each component’s demand, and
interarrival times of EOU WM are all generated using exponential distributions. After retrieving
this information, all EOUPs ship to station 1 for disassembly; alternatively, if EOUP only requires
a singular repair on a component, it is transported to the station corresponding with the repair. The
condition of components will dictate the type of disassembly operation, of which there are two:
destructive or nondestructive. Destructive disassembly is used for components that have lost all
functionality (e.g., parts are broken or have 0 % remaining life) while ensuring that the remaining
working components are not damaged. The effort needed to preserve working components means
that unit disassembly costs for functional components tend to exceed costs for nonfunctional
components. Given the availability of comprehensive, sensor-detected component information
after disassembly, no further component testing is required at this stage. It is assumed that the cost
of retrieving information is lower than inspections and testing, and that EOUPs have known

An SEP’s overall condition and estimated remaining life will determine its unique recovery
operations. Different components meet different needs; recovered components may be used for
spare parts demand, while consumer product demands can absorb recovered and refurbished
products. Depending on inventory, recycled products and components may also meet materials
demands. As salvaged products wait to be recovered by customers, they are placed in varied life-bins
(e.g., one year, two years, etc.) after being categorized on their remaining lifespan. In events where
the higher-life bins are full, product components with longer life spans are placed in lower-life bins
and thus subject to underutilization. If products, components, or other material inventory ever exceed
the maximum inventory levels allowed, or are simply assumed as excess, they are disposed of or
used for material demands.
Repair and refurbish options, presented in Fig. 3, may also be chosen to fulfill product demands.
If an EOUP contains missing or nonfunctional (broken, zero remaining life) components, the repair
or refurbishing process must replace or replenish these parts to ensure that remaining life requirements are still fulfilled. Alternatively, components in EOUP may have lower remaining lives than
requirements specify, and would thus also need to be replaced.
In the event of SEP failure within a warranty period, failed WMs undergo information retrieval in
the ARTO system with the help of radio frequency data readers stored in the facility’s database. After
this stage, the WMs undergo the same recovery process as an EOUP.
Finally, to increase longevity and mitigate any risk for failure, WMs receive PM actions within
the warranty period. The remanufactured SEPs undergo information retrieval after traveling through

27

with this information in mind. Steps in this process include measurement, adjustment, parts
replacement, and cleaning. As illustrated in Fig. 4, PM actions performed on remanufactured
WMs with degree δ receive δ units of added remaining life compared to their condition upon
entering the ARTO system. In addition, the manufacturer will rectify any in-warranty failures
between two successive PM actions at no additional cost to customers.
According to Ilgin and Gupta’s [20] comprehensive study that quantitatively evaluated SEP
impact on disassembly line performance, results indicated that remanufacturing customer uncertainty is reduced with the use of smart SEPs and that these are favorable in improving performance. To translate and test this claim on an ARTO system, we developed a simulation model
mimicking a full recovery system and logged its behaviors under various environmental conditions. We built our discrete-event simulation models using ARENA program, Version 14.5, and
incorporated 90 factors into a three-level factorial design for additional consideration, viz., low,
intermediate, or high. We proposed these three-level designs with the intention to model any
possible curvatures in the response function, as well as to handle any nominal factors occurring at
these three levels. Tables 1, 2 and 3 detail the specific parameters, factors, and factor levels [21].
To implement a full-factoral design with 90 factors at three levels, an extensive number of
experiments were required (viz., 8.728E + 42). However, we opted to choose only a segment
of all possible combinations to shrink the required number of experiments to a researchable level.
We used a selection method called a partial fraction experiment to determine an experiment’s

Jnl Remanufactur (2017) 7:19–47

Fig. 4 Remanufacturing Process in ARTO System

arrays called orthogonal arrays (OAs) to incorporate into this method and experimental design.
The design of orthogonal arrays allows researchers to conduct a minimal number of experiments
with statistical accuracy, and in most cases OAs allow for more efficient analysis compared to
other statistical designs. Using the degrees of freedom approach, we can use the minimum number
of experiments possible to implement the Taguchi method.
For accuracy, the number of experiments selected must exceed or equal degrees-of-freedom in
a system. We chose the Precisely, L181(390) (i.e., 181 = [(Number of levels −1) x Number of
Factors] +1) Orthogonal Arrays given that there are 181 degrees of freedom in the ARTO system;
in other words, 181 experiments are required to address 90 factors in the three-level design.
Orthogonal Arrays also assume that no two factors interact with one another.
To further validate and verify our findings, we built multiple dynamic and counters plots and
animations for each simulation model. The time frame to run each experiment spanned 2000
replications with six months, assuming eight hours per shift, one shift per day, and five days per
week. The following equation is used for arena models to calculate profit:
Profit ¼ SR þ CR þ SCR−HC−BC−DC−DPC−TC−RMC−TPC−WC−PMC

ð1Þ

in which SR represents total product revenue generated; component and material sales during
run time in the simulation; CR represents the total revenue that the collection of EOU WMs
produces during the simulated run time; SCR represents scrap component sale revenue during the

categories. Additionally, one may calculate disposal costs by multiplying the weight of waste by
the unit disposal cost. We assume that it takes 20 s per WM to retrieve the information that smart
sensors detect, and that each truck trip requires $50 in transportation costs. The secondary market
for recovery products renders different price points depending on quality levels.

Two-dimensional warranty
During the product buying process, customers will often engage in comparison shopping to assess a

Jnl Remanufactur (2017) 7:19–47

close similarity between competing products, customers may also consider after-sale factors to aid in
their decision, such as discounts, warranties, parts availability, and other post-sales service. These
post-sale factors can become extremely important to the buyer in difficult product buying decisions;
thus, the warranty is a key factor that can assure product reliability for the customer and may serve as
a focal point for purchase decisions.
Warranties are contractual agreements that manufacturers initiate as a promise to customers to
correct product failures or compensate buyers for product issues that arise during the warranty period
in relation to the product sale. Warranties exist as a supplementary feature that can enhance the
customer’s perception of the product’s quality and performance, as well as an assurance that the
product will perform as intended for a specified period of time. Statistically speaking, warranty costs
for new items are equal in cases where the manufacturer practices good quality control. On the other
hand, EOU products undergo differing warranty costs depending on factors such as age, usage, and
maintenance history; thus, warranty costs from EOU items will statistically differ from those for new
items.
Remanufactured products are receiving increased stress on the importance of warranties as
consumer demands trend toward higher product quality and more attention toward environmental
sustainability; these trends will increase demand for remanufactured products, and subsequently
the costs of replacements and repairs for failing products. Remanufacturers for refurbished
products are thus placing higher priority on warranty management, and now must spend time
accurately estimating warranty costs to incorporate into product pricing structures. Such analysis
ensures that remanufacturers can still maintain profitability when selling these items to quality and
environmentally-conscious consumers. New product manufacturers struggle less with analyzing
warranty costs because factors such as usage and maintenance history do not need to be accounted
for; remanufacturers, however, must engage in a more complex warranty cost analysis because
warranties akin to new or secondhand products may not be economically sustainable for them. To
ensure profits, remanufacturers must test and compare warranties for these products and accurately estimate how much it will cost to implement them. They must also take into account other
key issues that can impact costs, such as how remanufactured spare parts will be serviced, and
how to replace or repair in-warranty failures [33].
In the two-dimensional warranty, a policy is defined by a region in a two-dimensional plane,
typically with one axis representing time or age and the other axis representing the usage. For
renewing policies, the warranty period begins anew with each replacement or repair. Therefore,
the warranty period is uncertain as the warranty expires only when an item does not fail for a
period W. in this paper we consider four different shapes of warranty region viz., Rectangular,
Infinite Strips, Four Parameters and Triangular shaped as shown in Fig. 5.
There are many different available two-dimensional consumer warranty policies which
most products are sold with. The most famous two-dimensional consumer warranties are the
Free Replacement Warranty (FRW), Pro-Rata Warranty (PRW), Renewable Free Replacement
Warranty (RFRW), Renewable Pro-Rata Warranty (RPRW) and a combination of the both
FRW/PRW or RFRW/RPRW.

Maintenance and warranty formulation
Modelling preventive maintenance effect
Usually, PM activities involve a set of maintenance tasks, such as, cleaning, systematic
inspection, lubricating, adjusting and calibrating, replacing different components, etc. [5].
The right PM activities may be able to reduce the number of failures efficiently, as a result
reduce the warranty cost and increase the customer satisfaction. This study, adopts the
modelling framework proposed by [26] to model the effect of PM activities.
A series of PM activities of a remanufactured item are performed at remaining life RL1,
RL2,… RLj,…, with RL0 = 0. Here, the effect of PM results in a restoration of the item so that
the item’s virtual remaining life is effectively increased. The concept of virtual age is
introduced in [25]; and then extended in Kijima [24]. In this study, the jth PM only reimburses
the damage accrued during the time between the (j − 1)th and the jth PM activities, as a result an
arithmetic reduction of virtual remaining life can be obtain [31].

Modelling failures
Most products are complex and multipart so that an item can be viewed as a system consisting
of several components. The failure of an item occurs due to the failure of one or more
components. A remanufactured products or component is categorized in terms of two states
viz., working or failed. The time intervals between consecutive failures are random variables
and modelled by proper distribution functions. Interchangeably, the number of failures over
time can be modeled by a suitable counting process.
Time to first failure of a remanufactured component depends on the remaining life of
the component at the time of sale of the remanufactured product. If the sensor information about EOU component (the component when the item was new) indicates that it has
never failed, or was always minimally repaired, then the remaining life of the component
at sale is the same as that of the item. Usually, the remaining life of remanufactured
component at sale differs due to the replacement or repair actions being different from
minimal repair. Therefore, the time to first failure under warranty needs to be defined.
Let RLi denote the remaining life of remanufactured component, i.
The sensor embedded in the item provides the remanufacturer with the remaining life
of the item at sale RL. The item failure is modelled by a point process with intensity
function (t) where t represents the remaining life of the item. (t) is an increasing
function of t indicating that the number of failures increases with age. The failures over
the warranty period [RL, RL + W) occur according to a non-stationary Poisson process

Modelling warranty policies
All warranty formulations for different policies are shown in Table 4.

Non-renewing 2D free replacement warranty policy
Under this policy whenever a remanufactured item fails in the warranty region, Ω, the
remanufacturer replaces all failures with a remanufactured item at no cost to the buyer. The
replacement comes with the remaining warranty coverage. If the replacement remanufactured
item fails during the remaining coverage, the process is repeated till the end of warranty
coverage. There are four different warranty regions under FRW policy as shown in Fig. 5.

Non-renewing FRW with rectangle region The warranty region is characterized by a
rectangular shape as shown in Fig. 5a. The warranty expires the first time a failure occurs
outside the warranty region. The policy assures the buyer a maximum coverage for W unit of
time and/or U unit of usage. As a result the number of replacements under warranty, N(RL), is
a random variable distributed with E [N(RL)] as shown in Table 4 along with the expected
warranty cost per remanufactured item.
Non-renewing FRW with infinite strips region The warranty region is characterized by
two infinite dimensional strips as shown in Fig. 5b. Under this warranty region, the policy
assures the buyer a guaranteed minimum coverage for W units of time after sale and for U
units of usage. The warranty expires the first time instant both time and usage exceed the limits
W and U respectively. As a result the number of replacements under warranty and the expected
warranty cost per remanufactured item are given in Table 4 where M1 (.) and M2 (.) are the
one-dimensional renewal function associated with the two marginal distribution function.
Non-renewing FRW with four parameters region The warranty region is characterized by
four parameters (W1, W2, U1 and U2) as shown in Fig. 5c. Under this policy, a buyer is assured of
warranty coverage for a minimum time period W1 and for a minimum usage U1 and for a
maximum cover for W2 unit of time and U2 unit of usage. As a result the number of replacements
under warranty and the expected warranty cost per remanufactured item are shown in Table 4.
Non-renewing FRW with triangle region The warranty region is characterized by a
triangle shape as shown in Fig. Fig. 5d. The number of replacements under warranty and
the expected warranty cost per remanufactured item are given in Table 4.

remaining life of the remanufactured item at failure. The refund is unconditional as the buyer
has no obligation to buy a replacement item. Similar to FRW policy, two different forms for
warranty region and refund function, R(t, x) are considered for PRW.

Non-renewing PRW with rectangle region The warranty region is characterized by a
rectangle shape as shown in Fig. 5a and the refund function and the expected warranty cost per
remanufactured are shown in Table 4.
Non-renewing PRW with infinite strips region The warranty region is characterized by
two infinite dimensional strips as shown in Fig. 5b and the refund function and the expected
warranty cost per remanufactured are shown in Table 4.

Non-renewing FRW-PRW combination policy
In combination warranty, the warranty region, Ω, consists of .two disjoint sub-regions Ω1 and
Ω2 where the warranty terms are different for each region. If a failure occurs in Ω1, the buyer
is entitle to non-renewable FRW policy. While, if a failure occurs in Ω2, the buyer is entitle to
non-renewable PRW policy. In other words, the refund is full and conditional when item
failure occurs in Ω1 and partial and unconditional if failure occurs in Ω2. Similar to PRW
policy, two different forms for warranty region and refund function, R(t, x) are considered for
FRW-PRW combination policy as shown in Fig. 5.

Non-renewing FRW-PRW combination with rectangle regions The warranty region is
characterized by two rectangle shape sub-region as shown in Fig. 5a. The warranty expires the
first time a failure occurs outside the rectangle. The refund function and the expected warranty
cost per remanufactured item are shown in Table 4.
Non-renewing FRW-PRW combination with infinite strips regions The warranty
region is characterized by two infinite dimensional strips regions as shown in Fig. 5b. As a result
the refund function and the expected warranty cost per remanufactured item are given in Table 4.

Renewing 2D free replacement warranty policy
Under this policy whenever a remanufactured item fails in the warranty region; Ω, the
remanufacturer replaced all failures with a remanufactured one at no cost to the buyer. The
replacement comes with a new warranty identical to the original one. There are four different
warranty regions under FRW policy as shown in Fig. 6.

Renewing FRW with rectangle region The warranty region is characterized by a
rectangle shape as shown in Fig. 6a. The warranty expires the first time a failure
occurs outside the rectangle. The policy assures the buyer a maximum cover for W unit
of time and/or U unit of usage. As a result the number of replacements under warranty,

Renewing FRW with infinite strips region The warranty region is characterized by
two infinite dimensional strips as shown in Fig. 6b. Under this warranty region, the
policy assures the buyer is guaranteed a minimum coverage for W units of time after
sale and for U units of usage. The warranty expires the first time instant both time
and usage exceeds the limits W and U respectively. As a result the number of
replacements under warranty and the expected warranty cost per remanufactured item
are given in Table 4.
Renewing FRW with four parameters region The warranty region is characterized by
four parameters (W1, W2, U1 and U2) as shown in Fig. 6c. Under this policy, a buyer is assured
of warranty coverage for a minimum time period W1 and for a minimum usage U1 and for a
maximum cover for W2 unit of time and U2 unit of usage. As a result the number of
replacements under warranty and the expected warranty cost per remanufactured item are
given in Table 4.

Renewing 2D pro-Rata warranty policy
Under this policy, if the remanufactured item fails in the warranty region, Ω, a remanufactured
replacement is supplied at reduced price. This can be viewed as a conditional refund since the
refund is tied to a remanufactured replacement purchase. Similar to FRW policy, two different
forms for warranty region and refund function, R(t, x) are been consider for PRW.

Renewing PRW with rectangle region The warranty region is characterized by a rectangle
shape as shown in Fig. 6a and the refund function and the expected warranty cost per
remanufactured item are given in Table 4.
Renewing PRW with infinite strips region The warranty region is characterized by two
infinite dimensional strips as shown in Fig. 6b and the refund function and the expected
warranty cost per remanufactured item are given in Table 4.

Renewing FRW-PRW combination policy
In combination warranty, the warranty region, Ω, consists of .two disjoint sub-regions Ω1 and
Ω2 where the warranty terms are different for each region. If a failure occurs in Ω1, the buyer is
entitle to FRW policy. While, if a failure occurs in Ω2, the buyer is entitle to PRW policy. The
replacement is covered with a new warranty identical to that of the original item. Similar to
PRW policy, two different forms for warranty region and refund function, R(t, x) are been
consider for FRW-PRW combination policy as shown in Fig. 6.

Renewing FRW-PRW combination with rectangle region The warranty region is
characterized by two rectangle shape sub-region as shown in Fig. 6a. The warranty expires
the first time a failure occurs outside the rectangle. The refund function and the expected
warranty cost per remanufactured item are given in Table 4.
Renewing FRW-PRW combination with infinite strips regions The warranty region is
characterized by two infinite dimensional strips regions as shown in Fig. 6b. As a result the
refund function and the expected warranty cost per remanufactured item are given in Table 4.

Modelling warranty policies
Assuming that the cost of each PM action is Cpm(δ). Each PM cost is a non-negative and nondecreasing function of remaining life increment factor of PM (δ) with effort m. Therefore, the
cost of each PM is a linear function of PM degree and is given by:

to offer. Section 7.2, shows a quantitative assessment of offering PM on warranty policies.
Finally, section 7.3 presents a quantitative assessment of the impact of SEPs on the warranty
and maintenance costs and policies to the remanufacturer. Section 7.4 discusses pricing of a
remanufactured item with consideration of warranty and maintenance actions.

Remanufacturing warranty policies evaluation
In this section, the results to compute the expected number of failures and expected cost to the
remanufacturer were obtained using the ARENA 14.5 program. We evaluate different warranty period with offering a preventive maintenance policy during each period. For illustration
we will discuss only the results of FRW in details where the rest are in similar fashion.
Table 5 presents the expected cost for remanufactured WM and components for twodimensional warranty policies. In Table 5, the expected cost to the remanufacturer includes
the cost of supplying the original item, Cs. Thus, the expected cost of warranty is calculated by
subtracting Cs from the expected cost to remanufacturer. For example, from Table 5, for
W = 0.5 and RL = 1, the warranty cost for WM is |$102.88 – Cs| = |$102.88 - $120.00| = $17.12
which is ([$17.12 / $120.00] × 100) = 14.27% saving of the cost of supplying the item, Cs,
which is significantly less than that $120.00, Cs. This saving might be acceptable, but the
corresponding values for longer warranties costs are much higher. For example, for
W = 2 years and RL = 1, the corresponding percentage is ([|$145.90 - $120.00| / $120.00] ×
100) = 21.58% of the total cost extra for offering FRW on remanufactured WM with 1 year
remaining life.

Preventive maintenance evaluation
In order to assess the impact of PM on warranty cost, pairwise t tests were carried out for each
performance measure. Table 6 presents all models costs for warranty models with PM
respectively. According to these tables, PM achieves significant savings in holding, backorder,
disassembly, disposal, remanufacturing, transportation, warranty, PM costs and number of
warranty claims. In addition, SEPs provide significant improvements in total revenue and
profit. According to Table 6, offering PM helps remanufacturer achieve saving 18%, 21%,
19% and 18% in total cost for Conventional, SEM with FRW, SEM with FRW, and SEM with
FRW respectively.
The lowest average value of warranty and the number of warranty claims during the
warranty period for remanufactured WMs across all policies are $16,473.42 and 19,934 claims
respectively for the Sensor Embedded Model with FRW policy and $3159.75 PM cost for the
SEPs with RPRW policy. Whereas the RPRW has the worst values for the warranty and the
number of warranty claims while PRW policy has the worst PM cost during the warranty
period.

Sensor embedded evaluation
In order to assess the impact of SEPs on warranty cost, pairwise t tests were carried out for
each performance measure. Tables 7, 8 and 9 present 95 % confidence interval, t value and p

MINITAB-17 program was used to carry out one-way analyses of variance (ANOVA) and
Tukey pairwise comparisons for all the results in this section. ANOVA was used in order to
determine whether there are any significant differences between the warranty costs, number of
claims and PM costs for the four different models viz., SEPs with FRW, SEPs with PRW, SEPs
with FRW/PRW, SEPs with RFRW, SEPs with RPRW and SEPs with RFRW/RPRW, while
the Tukey pairwise comparisons was conducted to identify which models are similar and
which models are not. Table 7 shows that there is a significant difference in warranty costs
between different warranty policies. Tukey test shows that all the models are different and the
SEP model with FRW policy has the lowest warranty cost. In addition, there is a significant
difference in the number of warranty claims between different warranty policies (see Table 8).
The FRW policy has the lowest number of claims. Finally, Table 9 shows that there is a
significant difference in PM costs between different warranty policies. Tukey test shows that
all models are different except for RPRW and FRW/PRW there are no significant difference
between them and between RFRW/RPRW and FRW in term of PM cost. The SEP model with
CSW policy has the lowest costs. These results can be useful in the determining the economical warranty policy associated with embedding sensors in WMs.

Pricing of a remanufactured item

to price each item so as to recover the warranty and preventive maintenance costs associated
with the item, then the sale price, CS (v), of a remanufactured item of virtual remaining life v
needs to satisfy the inequality given below and failure to do so would imply a loss (rather than
profit) in an expected sense.
C S ðvÞ > C p ðvÞ þ C ðmÞ þ C d ðW; vÞ þ C pm

If the remanufacturer were to price an item based on a fixed expected warranty cost, then
the warranty duration (W) must decrease as the virtual remaining life (v) decrease. This
indicates a shorter warranty period for a remanufactured item with low remaining life. An
alternative strategy for overcoming this problem is to determine the sale price based on a
warranty cost averaged over the different remaining lives. That will make higher warranty
costs for less remaining life. Remanufactured items are balanced by lower warranty costs for
higher remaining life items. This lowers the sale price of lower remaining life items at the
expense of higher sale price for higher remaining life items. From a marketing point of view,
this is a more attractive and better strategy for the remanufacturer.

Conclusions
Sensor embedded products utilize sensors implanted into products during their production
process. Sensors are useful in predicting the best warranty policy and warranty period to offer a
customer for the remanufactured components and products. The conditions and remaining
lives of components and products can be estimated prior to offering a warranty based on the
data provided by the sensors. This helps reduce the number of claims during warranty periods
and eliminates unnecessary costs inflicted on the remanufacturer. The two-dimensional Free
Replacement Warranty (FRW), Pro-Rata Warranty (PRW) Renewable FRW, Renewable PRW
and combination FRW/PRW or RFRW/RPRW policies’ costs for remanufactured products and
components were evaluated for different periods in this paper. To that end, the effect of
offering two-dimensional warranty policies to each disassembled component and sensor
embedded remanufactured product was examined and the impact of sensor embedded products
on warranty costs was assessed. A case study and varying simulation scenarios were examined
and presented to illustrate the model’s applicability.
