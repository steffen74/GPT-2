Introduction
The universality of the economy and the development of information technology have
changed the supply-oriented market to the demand-oriented one and have made the organizations to understand the importance of the customers’ need satisfaction. [1, 2] Based on this, the
Supply Chain Management (SCM) has gained prime importance since the customers’ interests
and need satisfaction depend not only on the last identity attached to the customer, i.e., the final
product but also on the other upstream suppliers.
In a traditional perspective, the SCM includes guiding all supply chain members in an
integrated and coordinated way in order to improve the performance and promote the utility
and benefit. Therefore, the supply chain managers were seeking the fast delivery of products
and services, cost reduction and the quality increase. However, the improvement of the
environmental performance of the supply chain and social costs and the destruction of
environment are not considered. The pressure of governmental rules to achieve the environmental standards in one hand, and the increasing growth of the customer demands to supply
the green products on the other hand have stabilized the concept of the Green Supply Chain
Management (GSCM).
Today, in advanced companies, GSCM is attempting to use the green logistics and the
environmental improvement in the whole supply chain as a strategic weapon to achieve a
sustainable competitive strategy and organize their goals based on three important subjects: the
green (product) design, the green (process) production and the product recycling [3]. In the
past, the product life cycle included the processes of some phases from designing to consumption [4]. Environmental management includes the processes of preparing raw materials,
designing, composing, using and recycling and reusing of materials and forming a closed loop
of material to reduce the resource consumption and to reduce the environmental destructive
effects. [5]. So, organizations should use the environmental management in the whole life
cycle of their products to assure that the improvement of the environmental performance of the
supply chain has taken place.
The review of literatures shows that the practices of the green supply chain have some impacts
on the Supply Chain Performance (SCP). By studying the references, it seems that there are
remarkable studies in international articles on different aspects of the GSCM practices. [6, 7]. Ahi
and Searcy [8] have identified and analyzed the metrics that had been used to address the energyrelated issues in GSCM and Sustainable Supply Chain Management (SSCM). These metrics were
identified based on a structured content analysis of 445 articles published up to the end of 2012.
Youn et al. [9] have pointed out that the environmental SCM practices have some special

53

Moreover, gaining competitive edge through effective implementation of sustainable practices in a highly competitive environment becomes increasingly difficult. Such increased
competition has even greater effect on industry such as the automobile undoubtedly which
is large, diverse and influential of many other business sectors [10].
In Iran, however, little attention has been paid to the GSCM. So, there is a large gap
between the desirability of GSCM in theory and its implementation in practice in Iran. In this
research it has been attempted to study the relationship between the GSCM practices and the
environmental, economic, and operational performance in the supply chain of Iranian automobile industry. Being the 12th largest automaker in the world and the largest in the MiddleEast [11], Iran has a crucial role in this large industry. The Iranian automotive industry was first
developed in the 1960s by relying on foreign vehicle manufacturers. Today, the industry is
dramatically growing and has become one of the Iran’s key industries, after oil industry. In
2006, Iran was ranked as the 16th biggest automaker of the world, and soon after, in 2009, it
experienced a 9.5% growth in production and was ranked as fifth in car production growth
standing next to China, Taiwan, Romania and India [12].
As a developing country, Iran has been emphasizing on the economic development, while
seeking to maintain a balance with environmental protection. These burdens have made quota
status too difficult for organizations to strike the balance between the economic advantages and
environmental, and operational performance. Iran’s automotive supply chains have not been
excluded from this adjustment. In Iran, the motor vehicle production has dramatically
progressed. Hence, the environmental liabilities particularly in Iranian automotive industry
have made grave concerns. The restricting pressures altogether have made the Iranian automobile supply chain managers to contemplate and commence the implementation of GSCM
practices to improve the economic, environmental, and operational performance. Therefore,
there is a huge demand for Iranian automobile industry, while challenges such as climate
change, energy provision and shortage of natural resources need to be handled [13].
In the present paper, the research questions are as follows: Is there a causal relationship
between GSCM practices and the firm performance in Iranian automobile industry? Moreover,
which aspects of GSCM influence on SCP and how this influences could be measured?
The main purpose of the present study is to investigate the relationship between GSCM
practices and their performance. For this, Saipa as a sample of automobile supply chain
players, which includes suppliers, original equipment manufacturers in Iran is considered for
the investigation. Hence, in this paper, to achieve this purpose, section “Review of literature”
presents the review of the literature in GSCM and its practices and performance. Section “The
conceptual model and research method” describes the methodology to make a conceptual
framework in order to study the effect of GSCM practices and performance in the supply chain
of Iranian automobile industry. In section “Data analysis”, the data analysis of Saipa Company
as a case study will be presented and the model hypotheses are confirmed based on the
extracted results. Finally, in section “Conclusions and suggestions”, the general conclusions
and suggestions are presented.

GSCM practices
Today, sustainable development assurance in every country depends on the optimal use of the
limited source of that country. Different strategies have been taken by government to face this
issue including applying the rules and green principles such as using raw materials which are
consistent with the environment in industrial and productive centers, decreasing the use of oil
and fossil energy sources, increasing the use of paper recovery, and reusing the waste materials
in companies with both private and governmental sections [14].
In this context, the great desire to make government regulations to get environmental
standards in one hand, and the increasing demands of consumers to consume the green
products on the other hand, has made a new concept as GSCM which includes the life cycle
stages of product from designing to recycling ( [15]/64/EC).
There are wide reviews in the area of GSCM especially in the late 1990 in which different
issues such as the green production, planning, green construction and the product recycling
were discussed [16–19].
Knowing a wider perspective related to the green supply chain is an important step in
knowing the sustainable environment branch. GSCM has had a rich literature especially since
1989. However, some concepts have been studied more in the past 20 years, concepts such as
the green design, green operations, reverse logistics, green production and the waste material
management. [20]. In a general definition, the green supply chain includes a collection of the
enterprise internal and external practices in the whole supply chain which leads to the
improvement of the environment and preventing pollution. Green supply chain management
has been defined as the management of raw materials, pieces and sections and all processes
from suppliers to the producers and finally to the customers and take back [21]. In other words,
GSCM includes the green purchasing, green productions, green distribution, green marketing
and reverse logistics [22].
Darnall has also presented a critical article concerning the SCM and he has pointed out that
the environment management systems have had little progress in decreasing the environmental

SCP
In the economic performance perspective, when the environmental performance of the company improves, it stimulates the economic performance from both negative and positive point
of view which increases the market share and make more opportunities in the market [25]. The
positive economic performance is reflected through the cost reduction in buying the materials,
energy consumption, waste materials deals and the wastes disposal. In contrast, the negative
economic performance will be seen through the increase of the costs related to the investing
and buying the materials which are compatible with environment [26, 27].
The operational performance has been defined as follows: Increasing the amount of timelydelivered goods, decreasing the inventory levels, increasing the scrap rate, promoting the
products’ quality, increasing the product line, and improving the capacity utilization [7].
In the environmental performance perspective, there exists a plenty of experimental studies
focused on the supply chain environmental performance. Tsoulfas and Pappis [28], for
example, have presented a model to analyze the supply chain environmental performance in
Greece. Zhu et al. [29] have studied the economical practices of the producers cooperation in
the environmental supply chain and its performance requirements in China. Youn et al. [9] in
an article titled supply chain strategic participation and the performance outputs have pointed
out to the relationship between the environmental SCM practices and the environmental
performance and business performance.

Impact of GSCM practices on the SCP
However, a few studies have achieved good conclusions on the impact of GSCM practices on
the SCP. Govindan et al. [13] have used the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory
method with intuitionistic fuzzy sets to handle the important and causal relationships between
GSCM practices and SCP can be considered as an example. In their study, a case study taken
from the automotive industry is presented to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed method
and their results have revealed the “internal management support”, “green purchasing” and
“ISO 14001 certification” are the most significant GSCM practices.
There are different factors which affect the acceptance and application of green supply
chain practices. One of these important studies for investigating the effective indices in GSCM
is Hu and Hsu’s [6] article. In their study, they have studied and recognized some essential
factors to administer the SCP in the electricity industry and in electronic industries in Taiwan.
In fact, their purpose was studying the critical success factors to administer the GSCM in
Taiwan electronic and electricity industries in comparison with European Union instructions.
Their study results show that there are 20 important factors in GSCM in Taiwan electronic and
electricity industries. Moreover, Kuei et al. [30], identifies the critical factors influencing the
adoption of green supply chain practices in Chinese firms. The participating firms were
classified into central, downstream, and upstream firms. They could show that external
environmental factors (including customer pressures, regulatory pressures, government supports, and environmental uncertainty) are the most important in adopting green practices. In
another study, Kusi-Sarpong et al. [31] have introduced a comprehensive framework for

Jnl Remanufactur (2018) 8:51–80

gold mining industry are examined by using the decision-making trial and evaluation laboratory (DEMATEL) and the analytical hierarchy process. The evaluation models have found that
the strategic supplier partnership and the end-of-life practices are the most prominent and
influential factors whereas lean and green operations, substituting toxic inputs with environmentally friendly ones and resale of used parts or components are prominent sub-factors.
Furthermore, Geng et al. [32] have tried to understand the relationship between GSCM
practices and the firm performance in the manufacturing sector in Asian Emerging Economies
(AEE) based on empirical evidence. They have developed a conceptual framework and
analyzed it through a meta-analysis of 130 effects from 25,680 effect sizes. The findings
revealed that the GSCM practices lead to better performance in four aspects: the economic,
environmental, operational, and social performance. Moreover, the results have indicated that
the industry type, the firm size, ISO certification, and the export orientation moderate several
of the GSCM practice-performance relationships.
Despite the importance of this issue, there are still a limited number of studies in the area of
GSCM and in its application in Iran. Regarding the importance of GSCM and its relationship
with environmental, economic and operational performance in the supply chain, the growth of
automobile industry, and the considerable role of the industry among other production
industries in Iran in the generating the national net income, in the present study, based on
the review of the related literature of the green supply chain and the environmental, economic
and operational performance, a conceptual framework has been proposed to understand the
relationship between the GSCM practices and the SCP in the supply chain of Iranian
automobile companies. In addition, this study is a significant step in maturing the academic
field by adopting a hybrid method for confirming GSCM practice-performance relationships.

The conceptual model and research method
In the model proposed by this study, a conceptual framework has been used in order to study
the effect of the practices of GSCM on the SCP of automobile companies in Iran and all
purposes and hypotheses of this study have been investigated through this framework. In the
following figure, the proposed conceptual model has been presented in Fig. 1.
As shown in Fig. 1, the proposed conceptual model of the study has used the classification
of Hu and Hsu to study the GSCM model. To study the GSCM, they have considered four
aspects including the organization involvement, the product lifecycle management, the product
recycling and the suppliers management [6].
For the factor of organizational involvement, the following aspects have been recognized
which include the green designing, top management support, environmental policy for GSCM,
cross-function integration, manpower involvement, effective communication platform within
companies and with suppliers, establishing an environmental risk management system for
GSCM, supplier evaluation and selection, Information System (IS), research and development
associated with the university professors and experts in the field of recycling.
For the factor called the product lifecycle management in green supply chain management, the
following aspects have been recognized which include the application of the life cycle assessment

57

For the factor called the supplier management in GSCM, the following aspects have been
recognized which include the environmental auditing for suppliers, suppliers environmental
questionnaire, the compliance statement, product testing report, bill of materials, establishing
the environmental requirements for purchasing items, and green purchasing.
Moreover to study the SCP model Zhu et al. [7] classification is taken into account to
investigate the SCP model of Iranian Automobile industry.
The purpose of the present study is to determine the relationships among the GSCM
practices. The type of this study is a covariance or correlation matrix analysis. In order to
devise the research hypothesis, based on the inductive reasoning, the library studies of the
related literature and the research background about the relationship between GSCM and SCP
have been carried out. Finally, the proposed conceptual model as the contribution of this study
has been analyzed by using the factor analysis method, Pearson correlation coefficient and
SEM.

Saipa with 100 subsidiaries and affiliates and approximately 40,000 employees, has been
considered as one of the largest industrial groups in Iran. Currently, the company has
cooperated with more than 1000 suppliers throughout the country with the capacity of the
annual production of 950,000 vehicles. The Saipa Group manages effectively to create
sustainable values for stakeholders through creating positive economic, social and environmental impacts on its own value chain activities. To do this, Saipa focuses its attention on the
following cases: to create sustainable value chain in auto industry, to create and develop
opportunities for customers, to produce sustainable benefits for shareholders and to produce
sustainable benefits for employees (http://www.Saipacorp.com).
With regard to the fact that Iranian automobile industry is monopolized by Saipa as the
greatest manufacturer in Iran, this company is chosen to evaluate the hypothesis devised in this
paper.

Pearson correlation coefficient
The correlation coefficient is often referred to as Pearson’s correlation or r coefficient. The
correlation r value requires both a magnitude and a direction of either positive or negative. It
may take on a range of values from −1 to +1, where the values are absolute and nondimensional with no units involved. A correlation coefficient of zero indicates that no
association exists between the measured variables. The closer the r coefficient approaches
±1, regardless of the direction, the stronger is the existing association indicating a more linear
relationship between the two variables. The strength of the correlation is not dependent on the
direction or the sign. Thus, for example, r = 0.90 and r = −0.90 are equal in the degree of
association of the measured variables. A positive correlation coefficient indicates that an
increase in the first variable would correspond to an increase in the second variable, thus
implying a direct relationship between the variables. A negative correlation indicates an
inverse relationship whereas one variable increases the second variable decreases. If there is
no linear relationship between the variables, r will be virtually zero.
It is necessary to perform a significance test to decide whether based upon the sample there
is any or no evidence to suggest that the linear correlation is present in the population. Hence,

59

Two-tailed significance test:
H0: ρ = 0 (the population correlation coefficient is 0; there is no association)
H1: ρ ≠ 0 (the population correlation coefficient is not 0; a nonzero correlation could
exist)
One-tailed significance test:
H0: ρ = 0 (the population correlation coefficient is 0; there is no association)
H1: ρ > 0 (the population correlation coefficient is greater than 0; a positive correlation
could exist)
Or
H1: ρ < 0 (the population correlation coefficient is less than 0; a negative correlation
could exist)
Where ρ is the population correlation coefficient. [33, 34].

Structural equation modeling (SEM)
SEM is a comprehensive statistical approach which tests the hypotheses regarding the
relationships among the observed and latent variables. A major advantage of SEM is the
ability to estimate a complete model incorporating both measurement and structural considerations. There are a variety of indices to evaluate the model fitness. In this paper, five common
fit indices recommended in the literature are used as follows which their values are indicating
an acceptable model fit:
1. Chi-square/degree of freedom (χ2/df) of less than 3 indicating the acceptable fit;
2. P-value associated with χ2/df of less than .05 indicating the acceptable model fit;
3. The Root Mean Squared Error of Approximation (RMSEA) with values less than 0.1
representing the acceptable fit;
4. The Goodness of Fit Index (GFI) with values greater than 0.9 indicating the good fit;
5. The Adjusted Goodness of Fit Index (AGFI) with values greater than 0.8 indicating the
acceptable fit. [35]
The aim of the present study is to investigate the relationship between GSCM and SCP in a
practical way. The Research method used in this article is a descriptive-correlation.
On the ground that, in this study, the distribution of weights between variables is normal and
parametric, Pearson correlation coefficient is used to find the linier relationship between them.
In descriptive-correlation researches, the correlation matrix or covariance analysis could be
implemented by using a factor analysis and SEM. In the factor analysis, the main goal is to
summarize the sets of data or finding the latent variables (construct). Also, in SEM, testing the
structural relationships is based on the hypotheses and literature.

measurement error. More complex measurement models in which the other sources of
systematic covariation between observed measures besides a common underlying construct
are present can also be formulated. This is critically important because most conceptual
variables can be only measured with error (both random and systematic errors) and ignoring
the measurement errors has undesirable effects on the model estimation and testing. Second,
SEM makes it possible to investigate the complex patterns of the relationships among the
constructs in one’s theory and assess both in an overall sense and in terms of specific
relationships between the constructs [36].

Statistical population and the sample size
The statistical population classified in three main classifications of upstream, central, and
downstream sections has included the top managers, commercial and production managers,
and logistics experts, all with at least 3 years of experience in the supply chain of Saipa
Company as case study. The number of experts in 9 studied companies cooperated with Saipa
were about 412 people. To determine the sample size, Cochran formula has been used as eq.

Regarding the statistical population number (412 people), the statistical sample size has
been estimated 200 people based on the sampling formula of the limited population. Morgan
table suggests a sample of 196 for the statistical population of 400 population size. For more
certainty, 285 questionnaires have been distributed and 217 of them were collected. To carry
out this study, the classified random sampling method has been used. Table 1 illustrates the
ratios of these groups and the number of samples. The statistical population of each company
(the number of experts) has been determined based on the interviews with companies’
managers. So, first the statistical population was classified and then a random sample of each
classification was selected.

the internet has been used. To collect data in the practical area, the questionnaire and field
researches have been used. The practical questions of the questionnaire include two sections:
a) the general questions which include general information and the cognitive population of
respondents. b) questions related to the practical aspects of GSCM practices with 22 questions;
(According to table 18 in appendix) the suppliers management aspect has 7 questions, the
product recycling has 3 questions, organization involvement has 10 questions, and the product
lifecycle has 2 questions, furthermore the questions related to the aspects of SCP includes 21
items (Environmental performance has 6 questions, positive economic performance has 5
questions, negative economic performance has 4 questions, and operational performance has 6
questions) (According to table 19 in appendix). Tables 2 and 3 illustrate the questions related to
the aspects of GSCM practices and SCP.
Now, the validity and reliability of the questionnaire will be discussed in the following
section.

Validity and reliability of the questionnaire
Reliability
To evaluate the reliability of the evaluation instrument, Cronbach’s alpha [37] method was
used. A sample of 47 questionnaires was the pretest and Cronbach’s alpha coefficient of the
questionnaire of GSCM practices was 88.8% and the SCP questionnaire was 82.5%. Since all
these numbers are above 70%, the questionnaire meets the reliability or validity characteristics.
The result of the questionnaire reliability test in Cronbach’s alpha method was completed for
217 questionnaires which has been summarized in Table 4.

Validity
To determine the questionnaire validity, there are different methods. In this study, the content
validity and structure validity methods were used.

Content validity First, to evaluate the proposed framework, the viewpoints of 12 experts
(including 10 managers and experts of the studied organization and 2 university professors)
were used. Generally, this evaluation was mainly focused on the content validity of the indices
presented for the evaluation of the considered aspects of the study. So, in the first stage, the
content validity method was used to evaluate the questionnaire validity rate.
The result of the questionnaire content validity test in Content validity ratio (CVR) [38] and
Content validity index (CVI) [39] was compiled for 12 experts, summarized in Tables 5 and 6,
as follows:
According to Lawshe, for 12 experts, the minimum value for CVR is 0.56. So in this case,
any question perceived essential by more than 9 panelists has content validity. Waltz and
Bausell [39] also posed a minimum value of 0.79 to the CVI factor for the assessment of
content validity. Thus, Tables 5 and 6 showed that the contents of SCP and GSCM questionnaires are validated.

Construct validity Construct validity determines the extent to which a scale measures a
variable of interest in this research. For considering convergence in the construct of GSCM and
SCP, the factor analysis is used. Exploring factor analysis and criteria factor was used to
investigate the construction of questionnaire. Factor analysis has depicted that all mentioned
criteria are measured in these questionnaires [40].

The construct validity aimed at establishing the degree to which an instrument measures the
construct it has been designed to be measuring. It is formed by convergent and discriminant
validity. All these forms are related to and dependent on the quality of the construct.
Convergent validity refers to the degree to which two measures of constructs that theoretically
should be related are indeed related. Although, the discriminant validity describes the extent to
which the measurements that should be unrelated are, in fact, unrelated [41].
In this paper, according to the conceptual model, the research hypotheses in which the
relationship between GSCM practices and SCP in Iranian automobile industry is in question
are in contrast to the concept of discrimination of GSCM and SCP variables. Furthermore, to
understand the correlations between GSCM practices and SCP dimensions, the outputs of the
canonical correlation analysis are as follows (Table 7):

Data analysis
The data analysis is accomplished by inferential statistical techniques particularly the exploratory factor analysis and the confirmatory factor analysis.
The relationships between the variables have been identified by using the exploratory factor
analysis and then the factoring has been implemented. Then the result is applied in SEM is
used in the confirmatory factor analysis. The variables are properly factored in the exploratory
factor analysis. Through the confirmatory factor analysis in SEM, factoring is either accepted
or rejected [42].
The software SPSS 22.0 has been applied for the first analysis and Lisrel 9.2 has been
applied for the second. In the following sections, the results of the exploratory factor analysis
and after that the results of Pearson correlation test and SEM will be presented. Then, the
secondary hypotheses will be studied. Finally, the main hypothesis will be explained after the
confirmatory factor analysis of both sides of the model. Indeed, latent variables of GSCM,
latent variables of SCP, and then the impact of GSCM on SCP will be analyzed.

The results of the exploring factor analysis
Exploring factor analysis for the questionnaire of GSCM practices
After the factor analysis of 22 variables based on the extracted data of 217 questionnaires, the
following results were achieved; Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin Measure (KMO) was 0.881 showing

that the sample size was enough. KMO Test is a measure of how suited the data is for factor
analysis. The test measures the sampling adequacy for each variable in the model and for the
complete model. The statistic is a measure of the proportion of variance among variables that
might be a common variance. The lower the proportion, the more suited the data is to factor
analysis [43]. And, “sig. In Bartlett’s test of Sphericity” was lower than 0.05. Bartlett’s test of
sphericity tests the hypothesis that the correlation matrix is an identity matrix, which would
indicate that the variables are unrelated and therefore unsuitable for structure detection. Small
values (less than 0.05) of the significance level indicate that a factor analysis may be useful with
the data [44]. Moreover, four factors with the total variance of more than 71.39% have been able
to evaluate the GSCM practices (According to table 21 in appendix). Thus, this shows the
suitable construct validity of the questions. A rotated component matrix of the GSCM practices
questionnaire has been shown in Table 8.

Exploring factor analysis for the SCP questionnaire
For SCP exploring factor analysis, similar to GSCM, the following results were achieved after the
factor analysis of 21 variables; KMO was 0.750 so that the sample size was adequate. In addition,
“sig. In Bartlett’s test of Sphericity” was less than 0.05. Furthermore, it is obvious that four factors
with the total variance of more than 71.39% could be able to assess the SCP (According to table
20 in appendix). This indicates the suitable construct validity of the questions. Table 9 has shown
the rotated component matrix of the SCP questionnaire as follows:

It is worthwhile to say that, in questionnaire related to SCP a Likert is provided to scale for
participants which is of a prime conceptual difference between positive economic performance
and negative one. First below Tables 10 and 11 is considered for the positive and the second is
allocated to negative economic performance questions:
As it is shown, according to Hwang and Yoon [45], scaling for negative economic
performance is in reverse order with respect to positive economic performance’s order with
the aim of compensating the revers effects of increasing and decreasing criteria of interest.

Pearson correlation coefficient analysis
To evaluate the strength of the correlation and the direction of the variable relationship of the
proposed model and to test the hypothesis, SPSS 22.0 software and Pearson have been used.
The results of this parametric test have been presented in Table 12.
Based on the SPSS 22.0 output in Table 12, the significance level is less than 0.5. So, the
null hypothesis (H0) is rejected and with 99% confidence level, it can be said that there is a
significant and positive relationship between GSCM practices and its aspects with the SCP.

Since the correlation coefficients have a positive sign, it can be concluded that there is a
direct positive relationship between the GSCM practices and its aspects with SCP. It means
that when the aspect of suppliers management, the product recycling, organizational involvement, and the product lifecycle management of GSCM practices increase, the SCP will
increase too. Moreover, the correlation coefficient shows the strength of this positive relationship. As shown in Table 10, among all aspects of GSCM, the product recycling is of the most
association with SCP with the correlation coefficient of 0.555.

The result of SEM analysis
Now that the existence of the correlation relationship has been recognized, the structural and
causal relationship between variables and the latent constructs of GSCM practices and SCP
can be evaluated by SEM method using the confirmatory factor analysis and Path Analysis,
using the computer software program LISREL 9.2.

The confirmatory factor analysis of GSCM practices model
To confirm GSCM hypotheses, the confirmatory factor analysis of GSCM practices model is
applied. The fitness indices of the model show that the model is fitted (Table 13). As it can be
seen in Fig. 2, all significance numbers related to the model’s main aspects have been
significant because their significance number is more than 1.96. So, it can be asserted that
the factors of suppliers management with significance number of 4.67, the product recycling
with 5.52, organizational involvement with significance number of 3.89, and the product
lifecycle with significance number of 2.57 have a positive and significant relationship with
GSCM practices. In other words, based on the fitness of the latent prediction model (Fig. 2), it
is confirmed that four mentioned factors meaningfully comprise the GSCM practices in Saipa.

The fitness indices of the model show that the model is fitted (Table 15). According to Figs. 6
and 7 there is a positive and significant causal relationship between the GSCM practices and
the SCP. The results show that the variable of GSCM practices predicts 70.56% of the SCP
changes in Saipa. So, the main hypothesis is confirmed.
As the variables including the suppliers management, the product recycling, the organizational involvement, and the product lifecycle construct their latent variable (GSCM practices)
and also according to the significant influential relationship between GSCM practices and SCP
of Saipa Company (with the significant number of 12.92), the secondary hypotheses 1 to 4
(sec. 0-0) are confirmed, too.
Finally, Tables 16 and 17 show the priority of the indicators of the GSCM practices and
SCP factors in Saipa, respectively. These tables can be considered as a quick reference to grasp
the factors which would affect the SCP and GSCM in Iranian automobile industry.

Conclusions and suggestions
The aim of the present study is to assess the impacts of GSCM practices on the economic,
environmental and operational performance with regard to Iranian automobile industry. According to this, a model has been developed in order to address the issue, comprised of the
hypotheses which have depicted the relationship between GSCM practices and the SCP with
respect to their indices. SCP has been included four dimensions of the environmental
performance, positive and negative economic performance, and operational performance.
GSCM practices also have been made of four aspects of supplier management, product
recycling, organizational involvement, and the product lifecycle management. Then, the
proposed model has been analyzed and confirmed by the combination of Pearson correlation
coefficient and SEM.
The model’s validity and reliability have been assessed. Then, the proposed model has been
implemented and approved as an applicable model in Saipa as a major automobile manufacturer in Iran. Therefore, the model has validity, reliability, and generalizability for assessing the
similar type of manufacturer.
Based on the obtained results of the study, four mentioned observed variables for GSCM in
Saipa are compatible with results of Hu and Hsu [6]. Furthermore, four confirmed aspects of
SCP as latent variable in Saipa are also consistent with the obtained results of Zhu et al. [7].
In addition, the confirmation of the research hypotheses shows that the improvement of
GSCM practices in Saipa positively promotes the SCP with the prediction rate of 70.56% and
in the 95% confidence level. This result is consistent with Zhu et al. [7] findings which had
concluded that there is a significantly positive correlated relationship between the improvement of GSCM practices and the operational, economic, and environmental performance in
Iranian automotive industry.

practices, concerning the suppliers management, Saipa is suggested to design the suppliers

for high-risk components. All those aforementioned suggestions would result in the enhancement of GSCMpracticesbywhichSCP inSaipawould be improvedaswell.
As other researches, this paper has some limitations; first, the barriers related to why
the company does not broadly implement GSCM practices have not been investigated.
The governments need such information to formulate the applicable policies to enhance
the environmental performances in automobile industries and support industrial organizations to break the barriers they may encounter. Second, in Iran, the basic knowledge on
GSCM encumbers it to conduct the surveys since this confined understanding may result
in the biased answers. Third, the research method has not considered the existed
uncertainty.
Finally, the following cases are suggested for further studies:

The Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is another method, similar to SEM, for
exploring the relationships between two multivariate sets of variables which is
appropriate to answer the research question. For the further approval of the
findings, it is suggested to apply CCA in order to evaluate the impacts of GSCM
practices on the SCP.
To study the mutual relationship between GSCM practices and SCP by considering the
