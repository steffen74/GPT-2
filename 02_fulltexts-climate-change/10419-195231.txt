Production risk and adoption of irrigation technology:
evidence from small-scale farmers in Chile


Since the green revolution, agriculture in developing countries has experienced a
technological transformation process principally driven by an increasing demand for
agricultural products. It has triggered a massive increase in the adoption of new
technologies, such as the use of chemical inputs, pesticides, traditional irrigation,
and high-yielding seed varieties, with signiﬁcant beneﬁts in terms of productivity
and poverty reduction (Evenson and Gollin 2003). However, concerns have lately
been raised on the grounds of sustainability, as the intensive use has consequences
for environment and human health (Ruttan 2002).
The adoption of traditional irrigation methods has shown to be beneﬁcial to
reduce farmers’ vulnerability to weather conditions, making production and
incomes more stable. However, traditional irrigation has also increased the pressure
on water reservoirs and created pollution problems.1
The aim of this paper is to study the effect of production risk on irrigation
technology choices and discuss adoption of modern irrigation in settings where most
rural households depend exclusively on rainfall for water supply. This is a particular
feature in developing countries and zones characterized by abundance of
precipitation.2 We argue that the latter may give rise to potential sample selection
problems in irrigation choices, which needs to be considered when analyzing the
association between production risk and farm technology adoption. For modeling
these irrigation choices, we as an example use agricultural census data of potato
family farmers in Chile.
Chile has the challenge to transform the Chilean agricultural sector into a worldwide agricultural production and food powerhouse (MINAGRI 2006). However,
such a transformation process requires incorporating small holder family farmers
into productive agricultural units not only serving themselves (home-production)
but as integrated highly productive active agents contributing to the achievement of
this objective. The Agricultural Development Institute (ADI) has continually
provided technical support to the family agriculture in areas such as investment in
human and productive capital, credit provision, access to markets, recuperation of
eroded soil and irrigation. In spite of this effort and progress observed in the last
decade, the technological gap between large and small-scale farmers persists. For
example, 89 % of total land under modern irrigation systems is held by larger
farmers (FAO 2009). This fact is what motivates this study to analyze the factors
explaining the slow adoption process among small-scale farmers, where the main
focus is on the importance of differences in production risk faced by small versus
large farmers.

Too much water poured on the ground by traditional irrigation systems may provoke a saturation
process, making excess water ﬂow over the land along with pollutants derived from the remains of
pesticides and fertilizers.

In the context of locations suffering from water scarcity, conﬂicting water use and insufﬁcient levels of
investment in water supply infrastructure, the adoption of water-saving technologies arises as one
alternative to increase efﬁciency in water use and minimize contamination problems. Furthermore, watersaving technologies contributes to enhance productivity and quality of production through a more uniform
straight forward. Risk-averse farmers may not adopt modern irrigation if it raises
production risk by increasing yield variability too much. In contrast, if the new
technology has the potential to attenuate variability in economic outcomes, then it
would be more rapidly adopted among risk-averse small scale farmers. Even though
literature on adoption of modern irrigation technology is well-documented, there is
little evidence concerning production risk and irrigation choices. Two exceptions are
Koundouri et al. (2006) and Torkamani and Shajari (2008). Both studies ﬁnd support
of a positive and signiﬁcant effect of production risk on adoption decisions, arguing
that new irrigation technology is a risk-decreasing input. However, both studies were
carried out in settings where the knowledge of irrigation beneﬁts is well-known and the
new technology seems to show some degree of consolidation, which only allow to
model changes from traditional to modern irrigation systems.
In Chile the pre-conditions are different. Due to abundance of precipitation
mainly in the southern territories in Chile, around 83 % of potato farmers do not use
irrigation, which amounts to 66 % of registered farming land. Exploiting these
differences in natural pre-conditions, we follow Foudi and Erdlenbruch (2012)
applying a sample selection approach to study the risk-decreasing properties of
irrigation under joint estimation of production and production risk. However, to our
knowledge, no previous studies have extended this approach to the decision of
shifting from conventional farming to modern irrigation technologies.
Moreover, in light of the high drought risk observed in Chile understanding the
underlying mechanisms of irrigation adoption is of fundamental value. Historically
droughts are frequent and affect 25 % of the continental territory. Furthermore,
climate change studies estimate an intensiﬁcation of aridity in the north zone,
advances of the desert toward the south, and less precipitation in the central zone at
the end of the 21st century (FAO 2010). Thus, the augment in temperature and
decline in precipitation along with an increasing demand for water resources foresee
a higher drought risk for the next decades. Therefore, improvements in water
efﬁciency by the adoption of modern technology are likely to become essential to
reduce the vulnerability of agriculture in the future.
The rest of the article is organized as follows: Sect. 2 reviews the main
arguments enhanced by literature as determinants of technology adoption. Section 3
describes the empirical strategy and data used to carry out this study. Section 4
presents the main results, and Sect. 5 concludes the article.

2 Conceptual framework on adoption of new technology
There is an extensive literature aimed at explaining the process of technology
adoption.3 Lower adoption rates are generally associated with imperfections in credit
markets, information, agro-ecological characteristics, input and output markets as
3
The determinants of modern irrigation have been examined by Caswell and Zilberman (1985), Negri
and Brooks (1990), Shrestha and Gopalakrishnan (1993), Green et al. (1996), Skaggs (2001), Foltz
mainly observed in developing countries (Feder et al.1985; Bardhan and Udry 1999).
A key element relates to the reduced credit opportunities farmers face. Lack of
access to credit in rural areas arises as a consequence of asymmetric information
and enforcement problems in the lender-borrower relation. This is particularly
augmented among small farmers in developing countries due to the lack of sufﬁcient
collateral (Udry 1994). Thus, when innovations require signiﬁcant levels of
investment, credit constraints may turn out to be a limiting factor in adoption
decisions. In addition, as the diffusion of innovation is scarce and fails to reach
potential users, farmers may face trouble in obtaining the maximum beneﬁt from
shifting to modern technologies. The optimal use of new production methods
involves adoption of new technologies to the local conditions, which implies a
costly learning process (Foster and Rosenzweig 1995). Imperfect knowledge about
the usage of new technology constitutes a barrier that delays the adoption process.
Furthermore, it is expected that new technologies are more likely to be adopted in
rural zones with better support infrastructure and localized near main commercial
centers, in which the availability of both complementary inputs and maintenance
services are more abundant (Sunding and Zilberman 2001). In addition, tenurial
arrangements that characterize the landlord-tenant relationship and land rent
contracts can affect adoption decisions. For instance, small farmers without land of
their own and facing short-term land contracts are less probable to adopt innovations
since they may be unable to enjoy the long-term beneﬁts of doing so (Bahduri
1973). Finally, agro-ecological characteristics that capture environmental heterogeneity are essential to attain a better understanding of the process of adopting
sustainable agricultural technologies (Dinar and Yaron 1990; Lee 2005). In
particular, modern irrigation methods have a higher relative advantage in zones with
lower land quality which lower water-holding capacity (Caswell and Zilberman
1986; Dinar and Zilberman 1991).
In relation to household characteristics, variables that control for differences in
farm size, off-farm opportunities, human capital, and gender play an important role
to capture the intra-household dynamic in explaining adoption levels (Doss 2006).
One key factor less explored in literature is the role of risk in adopting new
technology (Foster and Rosenzweig 2010). Rural households must deal with highincome ﬂuctuations as exposed to a variety of uncontrollable factors such as climate
conditions, economic ﬂuctuations, policy uncertainty, and individual-speciﬁc
shock4 (Bardhan and Udry 1999; Dercon 2002). In this context, decision making
under uncertainty is characterized by risk because some possible outcomes have an
undesired effect. If we assume farmers are risk averse, they would adjust their
4

First, climatic risk may trigger harvest failure as a result of occurrences of unexpected events from
nature such as drought, ﬂood or frost. Second, the inherent volatility of the agricultural market explained
mainly by ﬂuctuations in demand and supply generates another source of income variation via price
uncertainty. Third, given the fact that farmers make most decisions in advance far before the ﬁnal product
is sold in the market, prices are not known at the time choices regarding the production process are made.
Fourth, the recurrent need that governments face to change the direction of agricultural policy produces a
further risk component that enhances the uncertainty in investment decisions. Fifth, individual shock may
arise, for instance, when households are hit by an illness or unexpected death of one of its members whose
(Dercon 2002). However, when credit and insurance markets are absent or
incomplete, poor farmers characterized by limited landholdings, few assets, and
lower schooling face serious constraints to smooth consumption.5 Consequently, it
is expected that farmers depend on ex-ante management strategies to smooth
income, which would imply preferences for traditional technology with lower
expected returns. It may be true for new irrigation methods that due to higher
exigencies of knowledge in its use, adoption would raise the likelihood of failure in
spite of higher expected beneﬁts. However, modern irrigation technology is also
recognized for being a risk-decreasing input when reducing dependence on rainfall
and water availability, which make yields more stable. Koundouri et al. (2006) and
Torkamani and Shajari (2008) found a positive effect of production risk on
switching from traditional to modern irrigation technology, supporting a riskdecreasing effect.

3 Agricultural sector and family farming in Chile
In this paper, we examine the effect of production risk on irrigation choices,
focusing on a sample of family farmers in Chile among which modern irrigation is
an incipient agricultural practice. The agricultural sector is important in Chile,
accounting for 3.5 % of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and employing around
12 % of the country’s labor force. More than 50 % of production is commercialized
in international markets, which makes the sector highly dependent on world market
prices. The sector beneﬁts from huge climate diversity, which allows an ample
range of cropping activities. This agro-ecological diversity is considered one of the
Chile’s main comparative advantages. Some major agriculture products consist of
fruits, including grapes, apples, pears, peaches, and berries; horticulture, including
garlic, onions, and asparagus; and cereal and tuber such as wheat, maize, and
potatoes.
Family agricultural production represents one-third of Agricultural Gross
Domestic Product (AGDP) and contributes with 1.2 % of the GDP in Chile. In
addition, this segment controls 85 % of the farms in the country, and generates
60,000 direct and indirect jobs, beneﬁting 1.2 million of people. Furthermore,
family agricultural producers are one of the main food suppliers in the country,
providing around 60 % of food consumed in the domestic markets (INDAP 2011).
Family farmers are characterized by being mainly involved in traditional farming
activities such as annual crops, horticulture, and extensive cattle farming. They
operate small plots at low levels of working capital and often face credit constraints.
For simpliﬁcation, the Ministry of Agriculture deﬁnes family farmers as those
holding 12 hectares or less of basic irrigation (HBI) (FAO 2009). We follow this
deﬁnition in this paper.

Alternatively, poor farmers get involved in informal risk–coping mechanisms based on agreements
made by members of the same group or community to support each other in the case of shocks. In
addition, farmers also cope with risk by generating incomes from off-farm activities or by receiving
This study uses data from the VII National Agriculture and Forestry Census carried
out in Chile (INE 2007).6 All data is at the household level, except for tenancy
status, which was collected at the plot level. Household level data is combined with
location level data for soil and climate characteristics.
The Census only reports information on output and input variables for annual
crops. Farmers involved in other economically relevant cropping activities, such as
fruit trees and horticulture, were unfortunately not asked to report production and
input volumes. Given that our framework relies on the estimation of the production
function to compute risk measures, our data is not suitable to investigate the
association between irrigation technology and production risk to a larger segment of
Chile’s agricultural sector, other than farms growing annual crops. In spite of the
limitations outlined above, census data allow us to deal with a recurring problem
observed in site-speciﬁc data, in which a few villages or areas are surveyed, and data
lack sufﬁcient variation capturing the agricultural potential (Doss 2006). The
Census gives us an exceptional opportunity to exploit the climate diversity that
characterizes the Chilean territory. Due to its unusual length and the diversity of its
landscapes and ecosystems, Chile has many distinct climates, ranging from desert to
frosty polar in the extreme south. A national coverage of the Census running more
than 4000 km from north to south guarantees a unique setting to study the role of
natural pre-conditions (rainfall and soil characteristics) in the identiﬁcation of
selection into irrigation.
We choose to focus on potato farming. The choice of this crop relies on the
economic and social importance for agricultural income-dependent farmers. This
crop is the third more relevant annual crop in term of surface and occupies the
second position when production value is taken into account. Apart from its
economic relevance, potato farming is important from a social perspective due to
the fact that it demands great amounts of labor mainly during harvest season, which
is particularly transcendental in those zones with higher unemployment. Moreover,
this crop extends across the whole territory and its distribution can clearly be
organized in agro-climatic zones well differentiated (INIA 2006). This feature
allows us to pick up agricultural potential with more precision. Another issue is that
we are not able to distinguish amounts of inputs per crop. Thus, to ensure a clean
association between observed inputs and potato production, we decided to focus on
the sample of potato farmers whose entire land is allocated to this crop. This
resulted in a sample of 7274 observations.
Farmers report number of hectares irrigated by different irrigation systems. We
aggregate this information into three irrigation statuses: non-irrigation, traditional

The Agricultural and Forestry Census is conducted each 10 years. The previous Census was carried out
in 1997. To our knowledge, the 2007 Census was not designed to be able to track a sub-sample of rural
households from previous waves. The latter does not allow us to conduct differences in differences
techniques while controlling for unobserved time-invariant effects. However, it is highly likely that
structural changes affecting differently irrigators and non-irrigators have taken place in such a long

irrigation and modern irrigation.7 Table 1 shows the number of farmers and hectares
that fall into each category of irrigation.
The ﬁgures show that 17 % of farmers (and 34.4 % of farmed land) use some
system of irrigation. In addition, modern irrigation is adopted by 5.6 % of irrigators,
covering 13.7 % of the total irrigated hectares. Regarding traditional irrigation,
farmers using furrow technology amount to 70.7 % of the total (and 61.5 % as
measured by irrigated hectares). On the other hand, sprinkler technology seems to
be the more broadly used system among modern irrigators since three out of four
adopt this method. Table 2 depicts the summary statistics for inputs, environmental,
and location variables by irrigation category. Table 3 shows descriptive statistics for
farmers’ characteristics and institutional aspects by irrigation category.
Production yield increases as irrigation becomes more sophisticated. The same is
true for cultivated area, indicating that irrigation is more likely to be adopted by
large farmers. Irrigators mostly reside in zones with lower levels of precipitation. In
particular, both modern and traditional irrigators predominate in the central zone.
Conversely, non-irrigators are mainly located in southern locations, which
experience the highest levels of rainfall.
Education seems to be important to explain adoption of modern technology.
Furthermore, modern irrigators seem more agricultural income-dependent than
farmers using traditional irrigation. In addition, only 28.5 % of farmers report to
have used credit instruments. In relation to extension services, 38.6 % of farmers
with improved irrigation methods state to have received extension services in the
last 2 years, which compares to the 8 and 16 % observed among traditional
irrigators and non-irrigators, respectively. There is a clear trend for irrigators to
participate in organizations. Whereas participation reaches around 30 % among
irrigated farms, this ﬁgure is only 15 % among non-irrigators. Regarding land
property status, owning land with a registered title and rented land is more likely
among irrigators. While this amount is around 90 % of total land among irrigated
farms, it constitutes only 34.6 % of land held by non-irrigators.

irrigation category, and Table 5 explores changes in water rights uses across water
sources and type of irrigation, respectively.
Up to 44 % of non-irrigators report to have wells as water source in the plot.
Differences in costs associated with water extraction between surface and ground
water sources naturally impose a restriction to adopt irrigation. However, these
restrictions seem to be less important for the adoption of modern irrigation. Wasting
water becomes much more costly when pumped from ground water sources8 and the
availability of water sources other than rivers may promote adoption of new
technology (Caswell and Zilberman 1986).
Around 85 % of water sources held by non-irrigators fall into categories
classiﬁed as insecure tenancy—title is in process of regularization or use de facto—
in contrast to that observed in both modern and traditional irrigation. Undoubtedly,
usage rights are crucial to create correct incentives to undergo innovations that
require time to become proﬁtable.

5 Estimation procedure
The procedure to analyze the effect of production risk on adoption decisions follows
two steps. In the ﬁrst stage, we estimate the moments of a production function to
proxy production risk. In the second stage, the estimated moments are incorporated
to explain adoption of modern irrigation in discrete choice models.
5.1 Production risk
The moments of the production distribution are estimated by following a sequential
procedure in which production is regressed against a set of inputs (Antle 1983;
Antle 1987).9 The model is speciﬁed as follows.10
yi ¼ f ðxi ; zi ; hj ; bÞ þ ei ;

ð1Þ

where i = 1…N denotes individual farmers, yi is the logarithm of output (potatoes)
measured in kilos, xi is a vector of conventional inputs including land, labor, capital,
and fertilizer. Land is measured in hectares,11 labor is the sum of both family and
hired labor, and capital is the value of physical assets.12 All these variables are
8

If we assume that the marginal cost of water is closely associated with the energy cost of pumping
water, there is a positive relation between depth of water sources and extraction costs.

9

Due to lack of data on prices, we proxy production risk by the moments of production function rather
than the moments of the proﬁt function as Koundouri et al. (2006) do. This assumption lies in the linear
relationship between the moments of proﬁt and production function valid under price-taker individuals.

10

We used a Translog functional form which assumes inputs in levels, squares and cross variables.

1 hectares = 2.5 acres.

The capital variable was built using information with respect to ownership of draft mechanical capital.
These were weighted considering market prices. For the construction of the capital variable, we
considered the following tools and machinery: Ploughs trucks, vans, carts, choppers, harvesters,

It does not add up 100 % because some farmers have more than one water source

expressed in logarithms. We proxy the amount of fertilizer by including a categorical variable that takes the value zero (0) if the farmer does not use any fertilizer
machine, one (1) if the farmer uses a draft animal fertilizer machine and two (2) if
the farmer uses a draft mechanical fertilizer machine. Zi is a vector of farmers’
characteristics including age (expressed in logarithm), education13 and agricultural
dependence.14 Additionally, we include variables (hj) to capture variations in soil
quality and rainfall15 (expressed in logarithm) in locality j as well as regional
differences. Soil quality is measured by the percentage of non-eroded and slightly
eroded soil16 and rainfall was constructed as the cumulative precipitations in the
season 2010–2011. Unobserved regional differences are picked up by including

It takes the value of 0 if the farmer has no formal education, 1 if s/he has partially completed
elementary school, 2 if s/he has completed elementary education, 3 if s/he has partially completed high
school, 4 if s/he graduated from high school, 5 if s/he has partially completed a technical program, 6 if
s/he has completed a technical program, 7 if s/he has partially completed her/his university education and
8 if s/he graduated from college/university.

It takes the value 3 if the agricultural income represents 75 % or more of household income, 2 when
the proportion is between 50 and 75 %, 1 if it is between 25 and 50 % and 0 if this percentage is less than
25 %.
15
Rainfall data were obtained from agro-climate information provided by the Chilean Institute of
Meteorological Information (CIMI 2011) between the agricultural seasons 1999–2000 and 2005–2006.
Climate measures per location were obtained by matching locations with the nearest meteorological
stations. Unfortunately, information for regions VIII, IX, X and XIV are not available in the agro-climate
yearbooks with the same level of detail as the rest of the zones. For these cases, we used information
available in climate yearbooks collected from meteorological stations situated at airports.
16
Information on erosion was used as a proxy for land quality. It was extracted from a recent study
conducted by the Center of Information in Natural Resources (CIREN 2010), addressed at determining
the current and potential erosion of soils in Chile. The methodology for determining the level of erosion
integrates a set of soil, topographic, climatic and biological characteristics. Thus, erosion will be more
severe to the extent that soils are more porous and sandier, ﬁelds are more sloped and hold less vegetation

(iid) error term.
Under expected proﬁt maximization, explanatory variables are assumed to be
exogenous, and thereby ordinary least squares (OLS) of (1) produce consistent and
efﬁcient estimates of the parameter vector b (Koundouri et al. 2006). The s central
moment of production conditioned on inputs about its mean is deﬁned as:
ls ð:Þ ¼ Ef½yð:Þ À l1 s g;

ð2Þ

^
where l1 denotes the mean of production. Thereby, the estimated errors ei ¼
yi À f ðxi ; zi ; hi ; bÞ from (1) are estimates of the ﬁrst moment of the production
^
distribution. To compute estimates of the second moment, the estimated errors e are
squared and regressed on the same set of inputs as in (1):

^i
e2 ¼ gðxi ; zi ; hi ; dÞ þ ei :

ð3Þ

OLS provides consistent estimates of the parameter d, and the predicted values
are consistent estimates of the second moment of production distribution (Antle
1983). Estimation of the third moment follows the same procedure. This approach
exploits the use of cross-sectional data assuming that the moments vary among
farmers depending on input level, farms’ characteristics and environmental
conditions. Conditional moments are thereby used as measures of volatility to rank
farmers in terms of production risk.
5.2 Irrigation choices
In the second stage, the estimated moments are incorporated as explanatory
variables in a discrete choice model. Additional control variables include a dummy
denoting if the farmer is male; farmers’ age measured in years (in log); farmers’
level of education; a categorical variable that captures the degree of dependence on
agricultural activity; a dummy variable indicating if the farmer lives in the plot; the
farm’s size measured in total hectares (expressed in a logarithm); capital value of
agricultural machinery and tools (expressed in a logarithm); secure tenure measured
by the ratio between the sum of family-own hectares and rental land over total
hectares; a dummy variable indicating if the farmer had access to credit during the
last 2 years; a dummy variable indicating participation in any agricultural
organization; a dummy variable denoting if the farmer received extension services
during the last 2 years; percentage of non-eroded and slightly eroded soil; number
of both modern and traditional adopters per locality regardless of crops; and a set of
dummy variables to control for unobserved spatial differences in technology choice
across zones.
We propose three alternative models. First, we model irrigation decisions as an
ordered choice such that each category corresponds to a superior level of irrigation
technology. One may expect a monotonic relationship between risk production
measures and speciﬁc irrigation technologies as the capability of irrigation methods
to reduce production risk increases with the level of technicality. Second, we
traditional irrigator seems quite evident, gains from adopting modern irrigation for a
former traditional irrigator are more unclear as new technology involves
uncertainty. Finally, we discuss potential selection problems when analyzing the
shift from traditional to modern irrigation. We argue that the choice and economic
beneﬁts of irrigation adoption depend on natural pre-conditions to irrigate. Thus,
when considering only irrigation data, we might lose track of some people who are
eligible to adopt modern irrigation. If this characteristic is systematic, our standard
probit estimation may lead to inconsistent estimates (Wooldridge 2010). We,
therefore, also estimate a binary response model with sample selection (Van de Ven
et al. 1981) to address this problem. Denoting Y as the irrigation decision observed
with the value of 1 if the farmer irrigates and 0 otherwise, the selection equation can
be expressed as follows:
h 0
i
h
i
Â
Ã
0
Pr½Yi ¼ 1 ¼ Pr YiÃ [ 0 ¼ Pr w u þ ni [ 0 ¼ Pr ni \w2 u ;
ð4Þ
where YiÃ corresponds to a latent variable that depends on a set of variables w,
among which we include those to allow for identiﬁcation of the vector u. Basically,
we argue that selection into irrigation mainly lies in the fact that despite the presence of water resources in the farm, a signiﬁcant number of farmers do not make use
of these water courses for irrigation. Tables 4 and 5 show that the type of water
source and water rights statuses may play a role here. Thus, we assume that irrigation decisions respond to the availability of water sources in the farm and
moments of rainfall distribution. We account for water sources by deﬁning a
dummy variable that takes the value of 1 if the farm holds at least one source for
irrigation.

6 Results
Estimation of the selection equation is depicted in Table 6. As expected,
accessibility to water sources plays a crucial role in explaining the shift from
complete reliance on rainfall to adoption of irrigation systems. Furthermore, farmers
who reside in locations with lower levels of precipitation, higher variance, and

literature before. For example, Negri et al. (2005) examines the independent effects
of climatic mean and variance on the probability of adopting irrigation in USA. The
authors ﬁnd that higher temperatures and less rainfall increase irrigation, and most
importantly that the tails of precipitation distributions and water availability are
primary determinants of presence of irrigation. Furthermore, Foudi and Erdlenbruch
(2012) study the role of irrigation as a self-insurance instrument in the management
of production risk in France. They ﬁnd that irrigation decision depends on the
decision to purchase yield insurance as well as the mean and variance of water
availability. We compute a likelihood ratio test assuming under the null hypothesis
q = 0, that is, the log-likelihood for the probit model with the sample selection is
equal to the sum of the log-likelihoods of estimating a probit model for modern
irrigation and the selection equation separately. The evidence rejects the null
hypothesis suggesting that farmers irrigating may not be a random sub-sample of
total rural households, which supports the use of data on non-irrigators to correct for
sample selection.
We employ a Translog functional form to estimate the parameters of the
production function. Results are not shown but can be obtained from the authors
upon request. We use these estimates to compute the moments of the production
function, which are our proxies for production risk in the irrigation choice models.
Table 7 reports the estimated coefﬁcients and standard errors in parenthesis for the
irrigation choice models.18 The ﬁrst column shows the estimated coefﬁcients that
result from modeling irrigation as a binary variable. Column 2 depicts the estimates
for the ordered probit model, which assumes an order in irrigation choice. The third
column shows the estimated parameters for the multinomial probit model. We
assume non-irrigation status as the baseline. Column 4 shows the estimated
coefﬁcients for the model of modern irrigation for the selected sample of irrigators.
In this case, non-irrigators were dropped from the sample. Column 5 presents the
results for the model of adoption of new technology conditioned on whether a
farmer is already an irrigator. Regardless of the approach used, education, capital,
extension, credit access, number of adopters, and rainfall are statistically signiﬁcant
to explain adoption of irrigation in general, and modern irrigation in particular.19
17
A regional analysis based on agro-ecological zones with similar underlying natural conditions can be
an alternative manner to account for the initial choice of irrigation. Unfortunately, there is not enough
information on the irrigation status to reach convergence in the estimations for agro-ecological zones (no
non-irrigators in the north region and very few irrigators in the south). The later suggests that the ‘‘nonirrigation’’ status in some regions may lead to issues of colinearity. Alternatively, we replicate all the
estimations considering only those regions where each irrigation status is observed. This implied to drop
Regions VI, X and XIV from our sample. Yet, the results remain essentially unchanged. Results are
shown in Appendix 1.
18
Due to the inclusion of generated regressors in adoption equations in the form of moments of the
production distribution, standard errors were corrected using bootstrapping techniques.
19
Multicollinearity is always a concern. For instance, education is most likely highly correlated with
income variables such as the percentage of income coming from agriculture, capital and land can ease
access to credit, etc. However, correlation coefﬁcients show of correlations. We obtained a coefﬁcient of
0.16 for land and credit, 0.22 for land and capital and 0.27 for dependence on agriculture and capital. The

adoption. Similar results have been found in developing countries in the literature
before. For example, He et al. (2007) investigate the determinants of farmers’
decisions to adopt rainwater harvesting and supplementary irrigation technology in
China, ﬁnding that socioeconomic characteristics such as age and education, and
institutional factors associated with extension, assistance, training, and credit
services affect positively irrigation adoption decisions. Household resource
endowment variables, showing the ability of farmers to operate their land, were
also found signiﬁcant in explaining farm irrigation decisions in Ghana (Dessalegn
2005). Results conﬁrm the role of education as a complement to adoption when it is
knowledge intensive, and beneﬁts are linked to farmers’ management capacity.
Furthermore, they enhance the importance of access to credit in decisions that
involve ﬁnancing needs. Finally, the implementation of water-saving technologies
demands more knowledge about environmental factors, i.e. evaporation conditions,
to reach efﬁciency in water application, which makes extension services from
government agencies be more crucial.
Furthermore, the number of adopters of both traditional and modern irrigation at
the local level is also signiﬁcant. This result is in line with the literature addressing
the role of social learning spillover on adoption of new technology among farmers
that belong to related networks or adjacent geographical areas. For example, Foster
and Rosenzweig (1995) ﬁnd that neighbors’ experience inﬂuence rates of adoption
and proﬁtability of high-yielding varieties (HYV) in India. The later suggests that
farmers involved in a bigger network of experienced farmers with new technology
are more likely to adopt the new technology and are relatively more proﬁtable.
Furthermore, Conley and Udry (2010) investigate the role of social learning in the
diffusion of a new agricultural technology in Ghana. They ﬁnd support of farmers
adjusting their inputs in accordance with those of their neighbors who were
surprisingly successful in previous periods. Finally, Bandiera and Rasul (2006)
present evidence on how farmers’ decisions to adopt a new crop relate to the
adoption choices of their network of family and friends in Mozambique. The
authors ﬁnd farmers are more likely to adopt when other farmers in their network
also adopt.
When looking at the results from the probit model and ordered probit model
(column 1 and column 2, respectively), we also ﬁnd signiﬁcant effects of gender,
farm size, secure tenure, and participation in organization. Gender differences in
technology adoption are discussed in Ndiritu et al. (2014). The authors ﬁnd a gender
gap in the adoption pattern for some farm technologies in Kenya, indicating the
existence of certain socioeconomic inequalities and barriers for female farmers.
Furthermore, the larger the farm is the more probable adoption of irrigation
technology. Just et al. (1980) show that given the information and transactions costs
associated with innovations, as these costs increase, the critical size that make the
adoption proﬁtable also increases. The latter implies that new technology, which
involves larger information/transactions costs are less likely to be adopted by
smaller farmers. Empirical works conﬁrm this prediction (Negri and Brooks 1990;
Shrestha and Gopalakrishnan 1993; Skaggs 2001; Daberkow and Mcbride 2003;
contracts are more likely to irrigate. Similar results are found in the literature before.
For example, Soule et al. (2000) investigate the inﬂuence of land tenure on the
adoption of conservation practices in US. They ﬁnd that the owner-operators are
more likely to adopt practices that provide beneﬁts over the longer term.
Furthermore, Gebremedhin and Swinton (2003) examine the role of land tenure
security in investing in soil conservation in northern Ethiopia. They ﬁnd that
adoption of technologies associated with long-term investment such as stone
terraces was positively inﬂuenced by land tenure security. These ﬁndings conﬁrm
the importance of designing tenancy arrangements that guarantee rights to enjoy
long-term beneﬁts derived from implementing technological innovations.
In addition, results show that farmers participating in agrarian organizations are
more likely to use irrigation. Participation in organization may serve as a vehicle for
the adaptation, likely because transmission and diffusion of knowledge on new
technologies are fostered in organizations. These results are in line with Isham
(2002). The author ﬁnds that households with ethnically based and participatory
social afﬁliations in Tanzania may be more likely to diffuse new information
successfully and therefore to adopt new technologies.
We also explore the interactions between some institutional aspects and
household characteristics in our adoption models (see Table 8). In particular, we
interact age, education, and farm size with the institutional variables secure tenure,
extension, and credit. We ﬁnd that extension services are more likely to promote
adoption of irrigation among smaller farmers. This is important for focalizing
extension resources. When studying the switch from non-irrigation to modern
irrigation, extension services also play a role here, and access to credit seems to help
less educated and small farmers more. The latter suggests that institutional aspects
are more important for less favored farmers (small and less educated farmers). We
do not ﬁnd signiﬁcant results for the interacted variables when studying the switch
from traditional to modern irrigation.
There are some discrepancies in the results concerning the variables (1) residence
in the farm, (2) soil quality, and (3) production risk measures. Regarding (1), results
show that farmers who reside at the farm premises are more likely to adopt
irrigation technology. In particular, farmers are more willing to shift from nonirrigation to the new technology, as shown by the multinomial probit, and change
from traditional irrigation to new technology, as suggested by the probit model with
sample selection. These results may be consistent with information diffusion
arguments (Foster and Rosenzweig 1995) Bandiera and Rasul 2006), as interactions
and networks associated with farming activities are more likely to happen on-farm.
Moreover, results from the multinomial probit model show that both traditional
and modern irrigation are promoted in zones with poorer soil conditions, probably
as a means to deal with these disadvantageous characteristics. However, soil quality
considerations do not seem to drive shifts from traditional to modern irrigation.
Results are in line with previous studies ﬁnding that modern irrigation technologies
are more likely used in locations with relatively low land quality (Caswell and

positively affects the shift from non-irrigation to adoption of traditional technology.
In other words, our ﬁndings suggest that the greater the variance of production, the
higher the probability farmers will implement traditional irrigation systems.
Similarly, a greater value in the skewness of production entails a higher probability
of implementing traditional irrigation. This last ﬁnding tells us that farmers care
about downside yield risk, assigning negative weights to production distribution that
show higher probabilities of obtaining lower production values. On the other hand,
adoption of modern irrigation responds negatively to increases in both variance and
skewness of production when having traditional irrigation as baseline. Results are
robust to regional differences (see Appendix 2).20 The latter entails that farmers are
less willing to shift to modern irrigation when experiencing less certain yields and
higher downside risks. While results regarding traditional irrigation support the
well-known decreasing-risk properties of irrigation, ﬁndings on modern irrigation
are not in line with the ability of new technology to hedge against production risk
highlighted in the literature before (Koundouri et al. 2006; Torkamani and Shajari
2008).
To verify if these ﬁndings can be applicable to larger segment of the Chile’s
agricultural sector, we conduct a series of robustness checks. First, we replicate our
results using information on wheat small-scale farmers. Wheat is one of the most
important crops in Chile, comprising more than 50 % of the total hectares devoted
to annual crops, and grown in the whole country in diverse climate and soil
conditions. To allow enough information in all the irrigation categories, we, here,
were less restrictive than in the potato case. We selected those farmers that reported
to devote more than 90 % of their hectares to wheat farming. This is an issue in the
sense that we cannot guarantee that the inputs observed in the data are indeed used
in the wheat production process as in the potato case. This is crucial for estimating
production risk measures such that results must be interpreted with caution. Results
are shown in Appendix 3. We ﬁnd similar evidence as in the case of potato farmers.
Adoption of traditional irrigation is more likely to occur among farmers with high
production risk. However, the risk-reducing effect of modern irrigation technology
remains unclear. Second, to gain efﬁciency, we pool observations of farmers
allocating 100 % of land to either potato or wheat. Although the pooling exercise
seems to be reasonable, issues regarding the association between inputs and outputs
can emerge again when potatoes and wheat are not necessarily grown using the
same inputs (or we do not observe that). Results are shown in Appendix 4. We ﬁnd
support for previous ﬁndings. Traditional irrigation seems to be risk-decreasing
from the perspective of non-irrigators while the switch from traditional to modern
irrigation increases production risk. Third, potato and wheat farming are more
resilient and less water demanding than other crops such that results regarding the
switch from no-irrigation to traditional irrigation (and not modern irrigation)
reducing production risk may respond to this speciﬁc characteristic. To explore this
further, we replicate the results for rice farming, a water-intensive crop. However,
20
Due to the inexistence of modern irrigation observations in some regions, we were not capable to
small, and it is not spread out the whole territory, which reduces climate variation.
The Census reports 1534 rice farmers mainly located in the central–south regions in
Chile. The majority of them use traditional irrigation (96 %) and only a small
fraction (4 %) modern irrigation. Farmers without irrigation methods amount to
1.56 %. Given the structure of irrigation adoption in rice farming, it is not possible
to control for pre-conditions applying sample selection models such that decisions
narrow down to a switch from traditional to modern irrigation. One caveat is that we
cannot ensure that irrigation is associated with rice farming since many of the rice
farmers grow jointly other crops. When applying the criterion of 100 % land
allocation in rice to ensure association between inputs and rice output, we end up
with very few observations (86), of which only one farmer reports to use modern
irrigation. The low adoption of modern irrigation among more water intensive crops
suggests that the insufﬁcient techniﬁcation in irrigation is a general problem in the
agricultural sector in Chile. Having those data issues in mind, we replicate the
results for those farmers that report to grow rice (see Appendix 5). We do not ﬁnd
signiﬁcant results for the second and/or third moments of the production
distribution, although coefﬁcients are negative.
Lack of support of the risk-reducing effect of modern technology may imply that
farmers in Chile are facing problems regarding seeing the virtues of water-saving
technologies as risk-decreasing inputs, probably due to the higher uncertainty
observed in the earlier stages of diffusion. The optimal use of methods of modern
irrigation may depend on certain characteristics of soil and climate that are speciﬁc
to a particular farm and inﬂuence the quantities of water required to achieve
efﬁciency in water application. The structure of this relationship may be more
difﬁcult to determine in earlier stages. In fact, new irrigation technology in Chile is
indeed in an early phase of the technological cycle, where lower levels of
knowledge and diffusion may possibly be adding an additional uncertain component
that would offset the advantages of modern irrigation. In contrast, when analyzing
the adoption of traditional irrigation, we are looking at shifts from a natural state of
non-irrigation toward the use of water input. In particular, this technological change
seems to be more developed in Chile and has likely reached a phase of maturity in
the technological cycle. The latter supports the importance of improving the
understanding and modeling of irrigation choices in settings in which rainfed
agriculture is still predominant, as typical in developing countries.
Finally, we evaluate the predictive ability of models looking at the percentage of
correct predictions.21 Appendix 6 shows these results. Percentages of correct
predictions range from 87 to 96 %, and univariate models explaining modern
irrigation choices, having as a baseline traditional irrigation, perform better than
multivariate models. Correct predictions as estimating a probit model for modern
irrigation choices increases signiﬁcantly from 1 to 29 %. Correcting for sample
21
A prediction is assumed correct when the estimated probabilities of observing a determined irrigation
status surpass 50 %. Predictions for modern irrigators in the probit model with sample selection were
computed using conditional probabilities—that is, probability of success conditional on selection.
Furthermore, non-irrigation predictions for this model correspond to those computed using estimates of
Furthermore, prediction in all of the remainder irrigation statuses also improves.
The latter suggests that modeling non-irrigation as one more level of technology
may be inappropriate when there exists speciﬁc natural pre-conditions that drive
non-irrigation choices. Thus, it seems reasonable to control for these pre-conditions
before studying changes from conventional to new irrigation technology.

7 Conclusion
New irrigation technology can improve productivity by attaining higher efﬁciency
in water application, which also brings external beneﬁts in the form of water
conservation. Furthermore, new irrigation methods hold numerous advantages in
zones with limiting environmental conditions, i.e. water scarcity and lower soil
quality. In this paper, we study the effect of production risk on the adoption of
irrigation. A large fraction of rural households in developing countries does not use
either modern or traditional irrigation and is completely exposed to climatic
variations. This gives rise to the question on how to include non-irrigators when
estimating irrigation choices. We discuss results from an ordered, unordered, and
sample selection models.
The results indicate that farmers with a higher educational level, larger capital,
credit access, receiving extension services, and those who reside in the plot and in
communes with larger number of adopters are more likely to adopt modern
irrigation. On the other hand, results for production risk depend on the type of
irrigation technology. Whereas production risk promotes adoption of traditional
irrigation, it seems to be an obstacle when assessing shifts from traditional to
modern irrigation. Credit access, extension services and production variance seem
to be more important in terms of magnitude.
However, a couple of caveats deserve attention. First, given the cross-sectional
nature of our data, we are not able to fully explore dynamics in irrigation decisions.
These may be important, especially in examining the role of economic and policy
changes on adoption of modern irrigation. Second, our results may be crop-speciﬁc
since water needs are supposed to vary across different cropping activities. For
example, potato and wheat are relatively more resistant to water stress than other
crops such as rice and fruits and therefore a switch from conventional to modern
irrigation methods may be more likely to be risk-decreasing in these last cases. Even
though we did ﬁnd sufﬁcient evidence for our sample of rice farmers, data issues do
not allow us to state plausibly whether our results can be extrapolated to other
relatively more water-demanding cropping activities. Further research examining
how results vary across different crops is needed.
Despite these considerations, our ﬁndings have important implications for the
success of government interventions to address concerns of the low rate of adoption
of new irrigation technology. First, adoption of irrigation indeed reduces risk;
however, we found that farmers may experience an increase in production risk when
switching from traditional to modern irrigation methods. This increased risk may be
technological cycle. The latter prevents the full exploitation of the advantages of
modern irrigation in terms of high productivity and lower production volatility. Our
results suggest that policy interventions through extension programs providing
adoption-related information and easing access to credit are necessary to induce
faster adoption and diffusion among small-scale farmers. Second, we found
evidence in favor of sample selection correction as analyzing irrigation choices.
Therefore, controlling for pre-conditions that determine irrigation before analyzing
changes in technology is crucial to achieve a better understanding on irrigation
choices in developing countries where non-irrigators still remain as a signiﬁcant part
of the rural population. Finally, another important implication of our empirical
ﬁndings is that climate change, which is expected to increase temperature and
reduce precipitations in Chile, is likely to have a material effect on the agricultural
sector. More speciﬁcally, it may increase drought risk and therefore reduce crop
yields. Thereby, adoption of more efﬁcient irrigation technologies is crucial to
manage the higher climate risk expected for the coming years.

Abstract In most developing countries non-irrigation status often dominates
adoption of traditional and modern irrigation technology. In this paper, we study the
effect of production risk on irrigation technology choice among small-scale farmers
in Chile, applying sample selection and discrete choice models. We ﬁnd that more
educated farmers, with credit access, receiving extension services, and living in
communes with more adopters are more likely to use modern irrigation techniques.
Moreover, production risk is often associated with adoption of traditional irrigation,
and this risk often undermines a shift to more modern irrigation systems. Controlling for pre-conditions that determine irrigation choices clearly improves our
understanding of small-scale farmer irrigation adoption decisions and we argue that
weaker knowledge about and lower automatic diffusion of modern irrigation is a
main obstacle for improving small-scale farmer productivity.

Since the green revolution, agriculture in developing countries has experienced a
technological transformation process principally driven by an increasing demand for
agricultural products. It has triggered a massive increase in the adoption of new
technologies, such as the use of chemical inputs, pesticides, traditional irrigation,
and high-yielding seed varieties, with signiﬁcant beneﬁts in terms of productivity
and poverty reduction (Evenson and Gollin 2003). However, concerns have lately
been raised on the grounds of sustainability, as the intensive use has consequences
for environment and human health (Ruttan 2002).
The adoption of traditional irrigation methods has shown to be beneﬁcial to
reduce farmers’ vulnerability to weather conditions, making production and
incomes more stable. However, traditional irrigation has also increased the pressure
on water reservoirs and created pollution problems.1
The aim of this paper is to study the effect of production risk on irrigation
technology choices and discuss adoption of modern irrigation in settings where most
rural households depend exclusively on rainfall for water supply. This is a particular
feature in developing countries and zones characterized by abundance of
precipitation.2 We argue that the latter may give rise to potential sample selection
problems in irrigation choices, which needs to be considered when analyzing the
association between production risk and farm technology adoption. For modeling
these irrigation choices, we as an example use agricultural census data of potato
family farmers in Chile.
Chile has the challenge to transform the Chilean agricultural sector into a worldwide agricultural production and food powerhouse (MINAGRI 2006). However,
such a transformation process requires incorporating small holder family farmers
into productive agricultural units not only serving themselves (home-production)
but as integrated highly productive active agents contributing to the achievement of
this objective. The Agricultural Development Institute (ADI) has continually
provided technical support to the family agriculture in areas such as investment in
human and productive capital, credit provision, access to markets, recuperation of
eroded soil and irrigation. In spite of this effort and progress observed in the last
decade, the technological gap between large and small-scale farmers persists. For
example, 89 % of total land under modern irrigation systems is held by larger
farmers (FAO 2009). This fact is what motivates this study to analyze the factors
explaining the slow adoption process among small-scale farmers, where the main
focus is on the importance of differences in production risk faced by small versus
large farmers.
1

Too much water poured on the ground by traditional irrigation systems may provoke a saturation
process, making excess water ﬂow over the land along with pollutants derived from the remains of
pesticides and fertilizers.

2

In the context of locations suffering from water scarcity, conﬂicting water use and insufﬁcient levels of
investment in water supply infrastructure, the adoption of water-saving technologies arises as one
alternative to increase efﬁciency in water use and minimize contamination problems. Furthermore, watersaving technologies contributes to enhance productivity and quality of production through a more uniform
straight forward. Risk-averse farmers may not adopt modern irrigation if it raises
production risk by increasing yield variability too much. In contrast, if the new
technology has the potential to attenuate variability in economic outcomes, then it
would be more rapidly adopted among risk-averse small scale farmers. Even though
literature on adoption of modern irrigation technology is well-documented, there is
little evidence concerning production risk and irrigation choices. Two exceptions are
Koundouri et al. (2006) and Torkamani and Shajari (2008). Both studies ﬁnd support
of a positive and signiﬁcant effect of production risk on adoption decisions, arguing
that new irrigation technology is a risk-decreasing input. However, both studies were
carried out in settings where the knowledge of irrigation beneﬁts is well-known and the
new technology seems to show some degree of consolidation, which only allow to
model changes from traditional to modern irrigation systems.
In Chile the pre-conditions are different. Due to abundance of precipitation
mainly in the southern territories in Chile, around 83 % of potato farmers do not use
irrigation, which amounts to 66 % of registered farming land. Exploiting these
differences in natural pre-conditions, we follow Foudi and Erdlenbruch (2012)
applying a sample selection approach to study the risk-decreasing properties of
irrigation under joint estimation of production and production risk. However, to our
knowledge, no previous studies have extended this approach to the decision of
shifting from conventional farming to modern irrigation technologies.
Moreover, in light of the high drought risk observed in Chile understanding the
underlying mechanisms of irrigation adoption is of fundamental value. Historically
droughts are frequent and affect 25 % of the continental territory. Furthermore,
climate change studies estimate an intensiﬁcation of aridity in the north zone,
advances of the desert toward the south, and less precipitation in the central zone at
the end of the 21st century (FAO 2010). Thus, the augment in temperature and
decline in precipitation along with an increasing demand for water resources foresee
a higher drought risk for the next decades. Therefore, improvements in water
efﬁciency by the adoption of modern technology are likely to become essential to
reduce the vulnerability of agriculture in the future.
The rest of the article is organized as follows: Sect. 2 reviews the main
arguments enhanced by literature as determinants of technology adoption. Section 3
describes the empirical strategy and data used to carry out this study. Section 4
presents the main results, and Sect. 5 concludes the article.

2 Conceptual framework on adoption of new technology
There is an extensive literature aimed at explaining the process of technology
adoption.3 Lower adoption rates are generally associated with imperfections in credit
markets, information, agro-ecological characteristics, input and output markets as
3
The determinants of modern irrigation have been examined by Caswell and Zilberman (1985), Negri
and Brooks (1990), Shrestha and Gopalakrishnan (1993), Green et al. (1996), Skaggs (2001), Foltz
mainly observed in developing countries (Feder et al.1985; Bardhan and Udry 1999).
A key element relates to the reduced credit opportunities farmers face. Lack of
access to credit in rural areas arises as a consequence of asymmetric information
and enforcement problems in the lender-borrower relation. This is particularly
augmented among small farmers in developing countries due to the lack of sufﬁcient
collateral (Udry 1994). Thus, when innovations require signiﬁcant levels of
investment, credit constraints may turn out to be a limiting factor in adoption
decisions. In addition, as the diffusion of innovation is scarce and fails to reach
potential users, farmers may face trouble in obtaining the maximum beneﬁt from
shifting to modern technologies. The optimal use of new production methods
involves adoption of new technologies to the local conditions, which implies a
costly learning process (Foster and Rosenzweig 1995). Imperfect knowledge about
the usage of new technology constitutes a barrier that delays the adoption process.
Furthermore, it is expected that new technologies are more likely to be adopted in
rural zones with better support infrastructure and localized near main commercial
centers, in which the availability of both complementary inputs and maintenance
services are more abundant (Sunding and Zilberman 2001). In addition, tenurial
arrangements that characterize the landlord-tenant relationship and land rent
contracts can affect adoption decisions. For instance, small farmers without land of
their own and facing short-term land contracts are less probable to adopt innovations
since they may be unable to enjoy the long-term beneﬁts of doing so (Bahduri
1973). Finally, agro-ecological characteristics that capture environmental heterogeneity are essential to attain a better understanding of the process of adopting
sustainable agricultural technologies (Dinar and Yaron 1990; Lee 2005). In
particular, modern irrigation methods have a higher relative advantage in zones with
lower land quality which lower water-holding capacity (Caswell and Zilberman
1986; Dinar and Zilberman 1991).
In relation to household characteristics, variables that control for differences in
farm size, off-farm opportunities, human capital, and gender play an important role
to capture the intra-household dynamic in explaining adoption levels (Doss 2006).
One key factor less explored in literature is the role of risk in adopting new
technology (Foster and Rosenzweig 2010). Rural households must deal with highincome ﬂuctuations as exposed to a variety of uncontrollable factors such as climate
conditions, economic ﬂuctuations, policy uncertainty, and individual-speciﬁc
shock4 (Bardhan and Udry 1999; Dercon 2002). In this context, decision making
under uncertainty is characterized by risk because some possible outcomes have an
undesired effect. If we assume farmers are risk averse, they would adjust their
4

First, climatic risk may trigger harvest failure as a result of occurrences of unexpected events from
nature such as drought, ﬂood or frost. Second, the inherent volatility of the agricultural market explained
mainly by ﬂuctuations in demand and supply generates another source of income variation via price
uncertainty. Third, given the fact that farmers make most decisions in advance far before the ﬁnal product
is sold in the market, prices are not known at the time choices regarding the production process are made.
Fourth, the recurrent need that governments face to change the direction of agricultural policy produces a
further risk component that enhances the uncertainty in investment decisions. Fifth, individual shock may
arise, for instance, when households are hit by an illness or unexpected death of one of its members whose
(Dercon 2002). However, when credit and insurance markets are absent or
incomplete, poor farmers characterized by limited landholdings, few assets, and
lower schooling face serious constraints to smooth consumption.5 Consequently, it
is expected that farmers depend on ex-ante management strategies to smooth
income, which would imply preferences for traditional technology with lower
expected returns. It may be true for new irrigation methods that due to higher
exigencies of knowledge in its use, adoption would raise the likelihood of failure in
spite of higher expected beneﬁts. However, modern irrigation technology is also
recognized for being a risk-decreasing input when reducing dependence on rainfall
and water availability, which make yields more stable. Koundouri et al. (2006) and
Torkamani and Shajari (2008) found a positive effect of production risk on
switching from traditional to modern irrigation technology, supporting a riskdecreasing effect.

3 Agricultural sector and family farming in Chile
In this paper, we examine the effect of production risk on irrigation choices,
focusing on a sample of family farmers in Chile among which modern irrigation is
an incipient agricultural practice. The agricultural sector is important in Chile,
accounting for 3.5 % of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and employing around
12 % of the country’s labor force. More than 50 % of production is commercialized
in international markets, which makes the sector highly dependent on world market
prices. The sector beneﬁts from huge climate diversity, which allows an ample
range of cropping activities. This agro-ecological diversity is considered one of the
Chile’s main comparative advantages. Some major agriculture products consist of
fruits, including grapes, apples, pears, peaches, and berries; horticulture, including
garlic, onions, and asparagus; and cereal and tuber such as wheat, maize, and
potatoes.
Family agricultural production represents one-third of Agricultural Gross
Domestic Product (AGDP) and contributes with 1.2 % of the GDP in Chile. In
addition, this segment controls 85 % of the farms in the country, and generates
60,000 direct and indirect jobs, beneﬁting 1.2 million of people. Furthermore,
family agricultural producers are one of the main food suppliers in the country,
providing around 60 % of food consumed in the domestic markets (INDAP 2011).
Family farmers are characterized by being mainly involved in traditional farming
activities such as annual crops, horticulture, and extensive cattle farming. They
operate small plots at low levels of working capital and often face credit constraints.
For simpliﬁcation, the Ministry of Agriculture deﬁnes family farmers as those
holding 12 hectares or less of basic irrigation (HBI) (FAO 2009). We follow this
deﬁnition in this paper.

Alternatively, poor farmers get involved in informal risk–coping mechanisms based on agreements
made by members of the same group or community to support each other in the case of shocks. In
addition, farmers also cope with risk by generating incomes from off-farm activities or by receiving
This study uses data from the VII National Agriculture and Forestry Census carried
out in Chile (INE 2007).6 All data is at the household level, except for tenancy
status, which was collected at the plot level. Household level data is combined with
location level data for soil and climate characteristics.
The Census only reports information on output and input variables for annual
crops. Farmers involved in other economically relevant cropping activities, such as
fruit trees and horticulture, were unfortunately not asked to report production and
input volumes. Given that our framework relies on the estimation of the production
function to compute risk measures, our data is not suitable to investigate the
association between irrigation technology and production risk to a larger segment of
Chile’s agricultural sector, other than farms growing annual crops. In spite of the
limitations outlined above, census data allow us to deal with a recurring problem
observed in site-speciﬁc data, in which a few villages or areas are surveyed, and data
lack sufﬁcient variation capturing the agricultural potential (Doss 2006). The
Census gives us an exceptional opportunity to exploit the climate diversity that
characterizes the Chilean territory. Due to its unusual length and the diversity of its
landscapes and ecosystems, Chile has many distinct climates, ranging from desert to
frosty polar in the extreme south. A national coverage of the Census running more
than 4000 km from north to south guarantees a unique setting to study the role of
natural pre-conditions (rainfall and soil characteristics) in the identiﬁcation of
selection into irrigation.
We choose to focus on potato farming. The choice of this crop relies on the
economic and social importance for agricultural income-dependent farmers. This
crop is the third more relevant annual crop in term of surface and occupies the
second position when production value is taken into account. Apart from its
economic relevance, potato farming is important from a social perspective due to
the fact that it demands great amounts of labor mainly during harvest season, which
is particularly transcendental in those zones with higher unemployment. Moreover,
this crop extends across the whole territory and its distribution can clearly be
organized in agro-climatic zones well differentiated (INIA 2006). This feature
allows us to pick up agricultural potential with more precision. Another issue is that
we are not able to distinguish amounts of inputs per crop. Thus, to ensure a clean
association between observed inputs and potato production, we decided to focus on
the sample of potato farmers whose entire land is allocated to this crop. This
resulted in a sample of 7274 observations.
Farmers report number of hectares irrigated by different irrigation systems. We
aggregate this information into three irrigation statuses: non-irrigation, traditional

The Agricultural and Forestry Census is conducted each 10 years. The previous Census was carried out
in 1997. To our knowledge, the 2007 Census was not designed to be able to track a sub-sample of rural
households from previous waves. The latter does not allow us to conduct differences in differences
techniques while controlling for unobserved time-invariant effects. However, it is highly likely that
structural changes affecting differently irrigators and non-irrigators have taken place in such a long

irrigation and modern irrigation.7 Table 1 shows the number of farmers and hectares
that fall into each category of irrigation.
The ﬁgures show that 17 % of farmers (and 34.4 % of farmed land) use some
system of irrigation. In addition, modern irrigation is adopted by 5.6 % of irrigators,
covering 13.7 % of the total irrigated hectares. Regarding traditional irrigation,
farmers using furrow technology amount to 70.7 % of the total (and 61.5 % as
measured by irrigated hectares). On the other hand, sprinkler technology seems to
be the more broadly used system among modern irrigators since three out of four
adopt this method. Table 2 depicts the summary statistics for inputs, environmental,
and location variables by irrigation category. Table 3 shows descriptive statistics for
farmers’ characteristics and institutional aspects by irrigation category.
Production yield increases as irrigation becomes more sophisticated. The same is
true for cultivated area, indicating that irrigation is more likely to be adopted by
large farmers. Irrigators mostly reside in zones with lower levels of precipitation. In
particular, both modern and traditional irrigators predominate in the central zone.
Conversely, non-irrigators are mainly located in southern locations, which
experience the highest levels of rainfall.
Education seems to be important to explain adoption of modern technology.
Furthermore, modern irrigators seem more agricultural income-dependent than
farmers using traditional irrigation. In addition, only 28.5 % of farmers report to
have used credit instruments. In relation to extension services, 38.6 % of farmers
with improved irrigation methods state to have received extension services in the
last 2 years, which compares to the 8 and 16 % observed among traditional
irrigators and non-irrigators, respectively. There is a clear trend for irrigators to
participate in organizations. Whereas participation reaches around 30 % among
irrigated farms, this ﬁgure is only 15 % among non-irrigators. Regarding land
property status, owning land with a registered title and rented land is more likely
among irrigators. While this amount is around 90 % of total land among irrigated
farms, it constitutes only 34.6 % of land held by non-irrigators.

irrigation category, and Table 5 explores changes in water rights uses across water
sources and type of irrigation, respectively.
Up to 44 % of non-irrigators report to have wells as water source in the plot.
Differences in costs associated with water extraction between surface and ground
water sources naturally impose a restriction to adopt irrigation. However, these
restrictions seem to be less important for the adoption of modern irrigation. Wasting
water becomes much more costly when pumped from ground water sources8 and the
availability of water sources other than rivers may promote adoption of new
technology (Caswell and Zilberman 1986).
Around 85 % of water sources held by non-irrigators fall into categories
classiﬁed as insecure tenancy—title is in process of regularization or use de facto—
in contrast to that observed in both modern and traditional irrigation. Undoubtedly,
usage rights are crucial to create correct incentives to undergo innovations that
require time to become proﬁtable.

5 Estimation procedure
The procedure to analyze the effect of production risk on adoption decisions follows
two steps. In the ﬁrst stage, we estimate the moments of a production function to
proxy production risk. In the second stage, the estimated moments are incorporated
to explain adoption of modern irrigation in discrete choice models.
5.1 Production risk
The moments of the production distribution are estimated by following a sequential
procedure in which production is regressed against a set of inputs (Antle 1983;
Antle 1987).9 The model is speciﬁed as follows.10
yi ¼ f ðxi ; zi ; hj ; bÞ þ ei ;

ð1Þ

where i = 1…N denotes individual farmers, yi is the logarithm of output (potatoes)
measured in kilos, xi is a vector of conventional inputs including land, labor, capital,
and fertilizer. Land is measured in hectares,11 labor is the sum of both family and
hired labor, and capital is the value of physical assets.12 All these variables are
8

If we assume that the marginal cost of water is closely associated with the energy cost of pumping
water, there is a positive relation between depth of water sources and extraction costs.

9

Due to lack of data on prices, we proxy production risk by the moments of production function rather
than the moments of the proﬁt function as Koundouri et al. (2006) do. This assumption lies in the linear
relationship between the moments of proﬁt and production function valid under price-taker individuals.

10

We used a Translog functional form which assumes inputs in levels, squares and cross variables.

11

1 hectares = 2.5 acres.

12

The capital variable was built using information with respect to ownership of draft mechanical capital.
These were weighted considering market prices. For the construction of the capital variable, we
considered the following tools and machinery: Ploughs trucks, vans, carts, choppers, harvesters,

It does not add up 100 % because some farmers have more than one water source

expressed in logarithms. We proxy the amount of fertilizer by including a categorical variable that takes the value zero (0) if the farmer does not use any fertilizer
machine, one (1) if the farmer uses a draft animal fertilizer machine and two (2) if
the farmer uses a draft mechanical fertilizer machine. Zi is a vector of farmers’
characteristics including age (expressed in logarithm), education13 and agricultural
dependence.14 Additionally, we include variables (hj) to capture variations in soil
quality and rainfall15 (expressed in logarithm) in locality j as well as regional
differences. Soil quality is measured by the percentage of non-eroded and slightly
eroded soil16 and rainfall was constructed as the cumulative precipitations in the
season 2010–2011. Unobserved regional differences are picked up by including

It takes the value of 0 if the farmer has no formal education, 1 if s/he has partially completed
elementary school, 2 if s/he has completed elementary education, 3 if s/he has partially completed high

8 if s/he graduated from college/university.
14
It takes the value 3 if the agricultural income represents 75 % or more of household income, 2 when
the proportion is between 50 and 75 %, 1 if it is between 25 and 50 % and 0 if this percentage is less than
25 %.
15
Rainfall data were obtained from agro-climate information provided by the Chilean Institute of
Meteorological Information (CIMI 2011) between the agricultural seasons 1999–2000 and 2005–2006.
Climate measures per location were obtained by matching locations with the nearest meteorological
stations. Unfortunately, information for regions VIII, IX, X and XIV are not available in the agro-climate
yearbooks with the same level of detail as the rest of the zones. For these cases, we used information
available in climate yearbooks collected from meteorological stations situated at airports.
16
Information on erosion was used as a proxy for land quality. It was extracted from a recent study
conducted by the Center of Information in Natural Resources (CIREN 2010), addressed at determining
the current and potential erosion of soils in Chile. The methodology for determining the level of erosion
integrates a set of soil, topographic, climatic and biological characteristics. Thus, erosion will be more
severe to the extent that soils are more porous and sandier, ﬁelds are more sloped and hold less vegetation

(iid) error term.
Under expected proﬁt maximization, explanatory variables are assumed to be
exogenous, and thereby ordinary least squares (OLS) of (1) produce consistent and
efﬁcient estimates of the parameter vector b (Koundouri et al. 2006). The s central
moment of production conditioned on inputs about its mean is deﬁned as:
ls ð:Þ ¼ Ef½yð:Þ À l1 s g;

ð2Þ

^
where l1 denotes the mean of production. Thereby, the estimated errors ei ¼
yi À f ðxi ; zi ; hi ; bÞ from (1) are estimates of the ﬁrst moment of the production
^
distribution. To compute estimates of the second moment, the estimated errors e are
squared and regressed on the same set of inputs as in (1):

^i
e2 ¼ gðxi ; zi ; hi ; dÞ þ ei :

ð3Þ

OLS provides consistent estimates of the parameter d, and the predicted values
are consistent estimates of the second moment of production distribution (Antle
1983). Estimation of the third moment follows the same procedure. This approach
exploits the use of cross-sectional data assuming that the moments vary among
farmers depending on input level, farms’ characteristics and environmental
conditions. Conditional moments are thereby used as measures of volatility to rank
farmers in terms of production risk.
5.2 Irrigation choices
In the second stage, the estimated moments are incorporated as explanatory
variables in a discrete choice model. Additional control variables include a dummy
denoting if the farmer is male; farmers’ age measured in years (in log); farmers’
level of education; a categorical variable that captures the degree of dependence on
agricultural activity; a dummy variable indicating if the farmer lives in the plot; the
farm’s size measured in total hectares (expressed in a logarithm); capital value of
agricultural machinery and tools (expressed in a logarithm); secure tenure measured
by the ratio between the sum of family-own hectares and rental land over total
hectares; a dummy variable indicating if the farmer had access to credit during the
last 2 years; a dummy variable indicating participation in any agricultural
organization; a dummy variable denoting if the farmer received extension services
during the last 2 years; percentage of non-eroded and slightly eroded soil; number
of both modern and traditional adopters per locality regardless of crops; and a set of
dummy variables to control for unobserved spatial differences in technology choice
across zones.
We propose three alternative models. First, we model irrigation decisions as an
ordered choice such that each category corresponds to a superior level of irrigation
technology. One may expect a monotonic relationship between risk production
measures and speciﬁc irrigation technologies as the capability of irrigation methods
to reduce production risk increases with the level of technicality. Second, we
traditional irrigator seems quite evident, gains from adopting modern irrigation for a
former traditional irrigator are more unclear as new technology involves
uncertainty. Finally, we discuss potential selection problems when analyzing the
shift from traditional to modern irrigation. We argue that the choice and economic
beneﬁts of irrigation adoption depend on natural pre-conditions to irrigate. Thus,
when considering only irrigation data, we might lose track of some people who are
eligible to adopt modern irrigation. If this characteristic is systematic, our standard
probit estimation may lead to inconsistent estimates (Wooldridge 2010). We,
therefore, also estimate a binary response model with sample selection (Van de Ven
et al. 1981) to address this problem. Denoting Y as the irrigation decision observed
with the value of 1 if the farmer irrigates and 0 otherwise, the selection equation can
be expressed as follows:
h 0
i
h
i
Â
Ã
0
Pr½Yi ¼ 1 ¼ Pr YiÃ [ 0 ¼ Pr w u þ ni [ 0 ¼ Pr ni \w2 u ;
ð4Þ
where YiÃ corresponds to a latent variable that depends on a set of variables w,
among which we include those to allow for identiﬁcation of the vector u. Basically,
we argue that selection into irrigation mainly lies in the fact that despite the presence of water resources in the farm, a signiﬁcant number of farmers do not make use
of these water courses for irrigation. Tables 4 and 5 show that the type of water
source and water rights statuses may play a role here. Thus, we assume that irrigation decisions respond to the availability of water sources in the farm and
moments of rainfall distribution. We account for water sources by deﬁning a
dummy variable that takes the value of 1 if the farm holds at least one source for
irrigation.

6 Results
Estimation of the selection equation is depicted in Table 6. As expected,
accessibility to water sources plays a crucial role in explaining the shift from
complete reliance on rainfall to adoption of irrigation systems. Furthermore, farmers
who reside in locations with lower levels of precipitation, higher variance, and

literature before. For example, Negri et al. (2005) examines the independent effects
of climatic mean and variance on the probability of adopting irrigation in USA. The
authors ﬁnd that higher temperatures and less rainfall increase irrigation, and most
importantly that the tails of precipitation distributions and water availability are
primary determinants of presence of irrigation. Furthermore, Foudi and Erdlenbruch
(2012) study the role of irrigation as a self-insurance instrument in the management
of production risk in France. They ﬁnd that irrigation decision depends on the
decision to purchase yield insurance as well as the mean and variance of water
availability. We compute a likelihood ratio test assuming under the null hypothesis
q = 0, that is, the log-likelihood for the probit model with the sample selection is
equal to the sum of the log-likelihoods of estimating a probit model for modern
irrigation and the selection equation separately. The evidence rejects the null
hypothesis suggesting that farmers irrigating may not be a random sub-sample of
total rural households, which supports the use of data on non-irrigators to correct for
sample selection.
We employ a Translog functional form to estimate the parameters of the
production function. Results are not shown but can be obtained from the authors
upon request. We use these estimates to compute the moments of the production
function, which are our proxies for production risk in the irrigation choice models.
Table 7 reports the estimated coefﬁcients and standard errors in parenthesis for the
irrigation choice models.18 The ﬁrst column shows the estimated coefﬁcients that
result from modeling irrigation as a binary variable. Column 2 depicts the estimates
for the ordered probit model, which assumes an order in irrigation choice. The third
column shows the estimated parameters for the multinomial probit model. We
assume non-irrigation status as the baseline. Column 4 shows the estimated
coefﬁcients for the model of modern irrigation for the selected sample of irrigators.
In this case, non-irrigators were dropped from the sample. Column 5 presents the
results for the model of adoption of new technology conditioned on whether a
farmer is already an irrigator. Regardless of the approach used, education, capital,
extension, credit access, number of adopters, and rainfall are statistically signiﬁcant
to explain adoption of irrigation in general, and modern irrigation in particular.19
17
A regional analysis based on agro-ecological zones with similar underlying natural conditions can be
an alternative manner to account for the initial choice of irrigation. Unfortunately, there is not enough
information on the irrigation status to reach convergence in the estimations for agro-ecological zones (no
non-irrigators in the north region and very few irrigators in the south). The later suggests that the ‘‘nonirrigation’’ status in some regions may lead to issues of colinearity. Alternatively, we replicate all the
estimations considering only those regions where each irrigation status is observed. This implied to drop
Regions VI, X and XIV from our sample. Yet, the results remain essentially unchanged. Results are
shown in Appendix 1.
18
Due to the inclusion of generated regressors in adoption equations in the form of moments of the
production distribution, standard errors were corrected using bootstrapping techniques.
19
Multicollinearity is always a concern. For instance, education is most likely highly correlated with
income variables such as the percentage of income coming from agriculture, capital and land can ease
access to credit, etc. However, correlation coefﬁcients show of correlations. We obtained a coefﬁcient of
0.16 for land and credit, 0.22 for land and capital and 0.27 for dependence on agriculture and capital. The

adoption. Similar results have been found in developing countries in the literature
before. For example, He et al. (2007) investigate the determinants of farmers’
decisions to adopt rainwater harvesting and supplementary irrigation technology in
China, ﬁnding that socioeconomic characteristics such as age and education, and
institutional factors associated with extension, assistance, training, and credit
services affect positively irrigation adoption decisions. Household resource
endowment variables, showing the ability of farmers to operate their land, were
also found signiﬁcant in explaining farm irrigation decisions in Ghana (Dessalegn
2005). Results conﬁrm the role of education as a complement to adoption when it is
knowledge intensive, and beneﬁts are linked to farmers’ management capacity.
Furthermore, they enhance the importance of access to credit in decisions that
involve ﬁnancing needs. Finally, the implementation of water-saving technologies
demands more knowledge about environmental factors, i.e. evaporation conditions,
to reach efﬁciency in water application, which makes extension services from
government agencies be more crucial.
Furthermore, the number of adopters of both traditional and modern irrigation at
the local level is also signiﬁcant. This result is in line with the literature addressing
the role of social learning spillover on adoption of new technology among farmers
that belong to related networks or adjacent geographical areas. For example, Foster
and Rosenzweig (1995) ﬁnd that neighbors’ experience inﬂuence rates of adoption
and proﬁtability of high-yielding varieties (HYV) in India. The later suggests that
farmers involved in a bigger network of experienced farmers with new technology
are more likely to adopt the new technology and are relatively more proﬁtable.
Furthermore, Conley and Udry (2010) investigate the role of social learning in the
diffusion of a new agricultural technology in Ghana. They ﬁnd support of farmers
adjusting their inputs in accordance with those of their neighbors who were
surprisingly successful in previous periods. Finally, Bandiera and Rasul (2006)
present evidence on how farmers’ decisions to adopt a new crop relate to the
adoption choices of their network of family and friends in Mozambique. The
authors ﬁnd farmers are more likely to adopt when other farmers in their network
also adopt.
When looking at the results from the probit model and ordered probit model
(column 1 and column 2, respectively), we also ﬁnd signiﬁcant effects of gender,
farm size, secure tenure, and participation in organization. Gender differences in
technology adoption are discussed in Ndiritu et al. (2014). The authors ﬁnd a gender
gap in the adoption pattern for some farm technologies in Kenya, indicating the
existence of certain socioeconomic inequalities and barriers for female farmers.
Furthermore, the larger the farm is the more probable adoption of irrigation
technology. Just et al. (1980) show that given the information and transactions costs
associated with innovations, as these costs increase, the critical size that make the
adoption proﬁtable also increases. The latter implies that new technology, which
involves larger information/transactions costs are less likely to be adopted by
smaller farmers. Empirical works conﬁrm this prediction (Negri and Brooks 1990;
Shrestha and Gopalakrishnan 1993; Skaggs 2001; Daberkow and Mcbride 2003;
contracts are more likely to irrigate. Similar results are found in the literature before.
For example, Soule et al. (2000) investigate the inﬂuence of land tenure on the
adoption of conservation practices in US. They ﬁnd that the owner-operators are
more likely to adopt practices that provide beneﬁts over the longer term.
Furthermore, Gebremedhin and Swinton (2003) examine the role of land tenure
security in investing in soil conservation in northern Ethiopia. They ﬁnd that
adoption of technologies associated with long-term investment such as stone
terraces was positively inﬂuenced by land tenure security. These ﬁndings conﬁrm
the importance of designing tenancy arrangements that guarantee rights to enjoy
long-term beneﬁts derived from implementing technological innovations.
In addition, results show that farmers participating in agrarian organizations are
more likely to use irrigation. Participation in organization may serve as a vehicle for
the adaptation, likely because transmission and diffusion of knowledge on new
technologies are fostered in organizations. These results are in line with Isham
(2002). The author ﬁnds that households with ethnically based and participatory
social afﬁliations in Tanzania may be more likely to diffuse new information
successfully and therefore to adopt new technologies.
We also explore the interactions between some institutional aspects and
household characteristics in our adoption models (see Table 8). In particular, we
interact age, education, and farm size with the institutional variables secure tenure,
extension, and credit. We ﬁnd that extension services are more likely to promote
adoption of irrigation among smaller farmers. This is important for focalizing
extension resources. When studying the switch from non-irrigation to modern
irrigation, extension services also play a role here, and access to credit seems to help
less educated and small farmers more. The latter suggests that institutional aspects
are more important for less favored farmers (small and less educated farmers). We
do not ﬁnd signiﬁcant results for the interacted variables when studying the switch
from traditional to modern irrigation.
There are some discrepancies in the results concerning the variables (1) residence
in the farm, (2) soil quality, and (3) production risk measures. Regarding (1), results
show that farmers who reside at the farm premises are more likely to adopt
irrigation technology. In particular, farmers are more willing to shift from nonirrigation to the new technology, as shown by the multinomial probit, and change
from traditional irrigation to new technology, as suggested by the probit model with
sample selection. These results may be consistent with information diffusion
arguments (Foster and Rosenzweig 1995) Bandiera and Rasul 2006), as interactions
and networks associated with farming activities are more likely to happen on-farm.
Moreover, results from the multinomial probit model show that both traditional
and modern irrigation are promoted in zones with poorer soil conditions, probably
as a means to deal with these disadvantageous characteristics. However, soil quality
considerations do not seem to drive shifts from traditional to modern irrigation.
Results are in line with previous studies ﬁnding that modern irrigation technologies
are more likely used in locations with relatively low land quality (Caswell and

positively affects the shift from non-irrigation to adoption of traditional technology.
In other words, our ﬁndings suggest that the greater the variance of production, the
higher the probability farmers will implement traditional irrigation systems.
Similarly, a greater value in the skewness of production entails a higher probability
of implementing traditional irrigation. This last ﬁnding tells us that farmers care
about downside yield risk, assigning negative weights to production distribution that
show higher probabilities of obtaining lower production values. On the other hand,
adoption of modern irrigation responds negatively to increases in both variance and
skewness of production when having traditional irrigation as baseline. Results are
robust to regional differences (see Appendix 2).20 The latter entails that farmers are
less willing to shift to modern irrigation when experiencing less certain yields and
higher downside risks. While results regarding traditional irrigation support the
well-known decreasing-risk properties of irrigation, ﬁndings on modern irrigation
are not in line with the ability of new technology to hedge against production risk
highlighted in the literature before (Koundouri et al. 2006; Torkamani and Shajari
2008).
To verify if these ﬁndings can be applicable to larger segment of the Chile’s
agricultural sector, we conduct a series of robustness checks. First, we replicate our
results using information on wheat small-scale farmers. Wheat is one of the most
important crops in Chile, comprising more than 50 % of the total hectares devoted
to annual crops, and grown in the whole country in diverse climate and soil
conditions. To allow enough information in all the irrigation categories, we, here,
were less restrictive than in the potato case. We selected those farmers that reported
to devote more than 90 % of their hectares to wheat farming. This is an issue in the
sense that we cannot guarantee that the inputs observed in the data are indeed used
in the wheat production process as in the potato case. This is crucial for estimating
production risk measures such that results must be interpreted with caution. Results
are shown in Appendix 3. We ﬁnd similar evidence as in the case of potato farmers.
Adoption of traditional irrigation is more likely to occur among farmers with high
production risk. However, the risk-reducing effect of modern irrigation technology
remains unclear. Second, to gain efﬁciency, we pool observations of farmers
allocating 100 % of land to either potato or wheat. Although the pooling exercise
seems to be reasonable, issues regarding the association between inputs and outputs
can emerge again when potatoes and wheat are not necessarily grown using the
same inputs (or we do not observe that). Results are shown in Appendix 4. We ﬁnd
support for previous ﬁndings. Traditional irrigation seems to be risk-decreasing
from the perspective of non-irrigators while the switch from traditional to modern
irrigation increases production risk. Third, potato and wheat farming are more
resilient and less water demanding than other crops such that results regarding the
switch from no-irrigation to traditional irrigation (and not modern irrigation)
reducing production risk may respond to this speciﬁc characteristic. To explore this
further, we replicate the results for rice farming, a water-intensive crop. However,
20
Due to the inexistence of modern irrigation observations in some regions, we were not capable to
small, and it is not spread out the whole territory, which reduces climate variation.
The Census reports 1534 rice farmers mainly located in the central–south regions in
Chile. The majority of them use traditional irrigation (96 %) and only a small
fraction (4 %) modern irrigation. Farmers without irrigation methods amount to
1.56 %. Given the structure of irrigation adoption in rice farming, it is not possible
to control for pre-conditions applying sample selection models such that decisions
narrow down to a switch from traditional to modern irrigation. One caveat is that we
cannot ensure that irrigation is associated with rice farming since many of the rice
farmers grow jointly other crops. When applying the criterion of 100 % land
allocation in rice to ensure association between inputs and rice output, we end up
with very few observations (86), of which only one farmer reports to use modern
irrigation. The low adoption of modern irrigation among more water intensive crops
suggests that the insufﬁcient techniﬁcation in irrigation is a general problem in the
agricultural sector in Chile. Having those data issues in mind, we replicate the
results for those farmers that report to grow rice (see Appendix 5). We do not ﬁnd
signiﬁcant results for the second and/or third moments of the production
distribution, although coefﬁcients are negative.
Lack of support of the risk-reducing effect of modern technology may imply that
farmers in Chile are facing problems regarding seeing the virtues of water-saving
technologies as risk-decreasing inputs, probably due to the higher uncertainty
observed in the earlier stages of diffusion. The optimal use of methods of modern
irrigation may depend on certain characteristics of soil and climate that are speciﬁc
to a particular farm and inﬂuence the quantities of water required to achieve
efﬁciency in water application. The structure of this relationship may be more
difﬁcult to determine in earlier stages. In fact, new irrigation technology in Chile is
indeed in an early phase of the technological cycle, where lower levels of
knowledge and diffusion may possibly be adding an additional uncertain component
that would offset the advantages of modern irrigation. In contrast, when analyzing
the adoption of traditional irrigation, we are looking at shifts from a natural state of
non-irrigation toward the use of water input. In particular, this technological change
seems to be more developed in Chile and has likely reached a phase of maturity in
the technological cycle. The latter supports the importance of improving the
understanding and modeling of irrigation choices in settings in which rainfed
agriculture is still predominant, as typical in developing countries.
Finally, we evaluate the predictive ability of models looking at the percentage of
correct predictions.21 Appendix 6 shows these results. Percentages of correct
predictions range from 87 to 96 %, and univariate models explaining modern
irrigation choices, having as a baseline traditional irrigation, perform better than
multivariate models. Correct predictions as estimating a probit model for modern
irrigation choices increases signiﬁcantly from 1 to 29 %. Correcting for sample
21
A prediction is assumed correct when the estimated probabilities of observing a determined irrigation
status surpass 50 %. Predictions for modern irrigators in the probit model with sample selection were
computed using conditional probabilities—that is, probability of success conditional on selection.
Furthermore, non-irrigation predictions for this model correspond to those computed using estimates of
Furthermore, prediction in all of the remainder irrigation statuses also improves.
The latter suggests that modeling non-irrigation as one more level of technology
may be inappropriate when there exists speciﬁc natural pre-conditions that drive
non-irrigation choices. Thus, it seems reasonable to control for these pre-conditions
before studying changes from conventional to new irrigation technology.

7 Conclusion
New irrigation technology can improve productivity by attaining higher efﬁciency
in water application, which also brings external beneﬁts in the form of water
conservation. Furthermore, new irrigation methods hold numerous advantages in
zones with limiting environmental conditions, i.e. water scarcity and lower soil
quality. In this paper, we study the effect of production risk on the adoption of
irrigation. A large fraction of rural households in developing countries does not use
either modern or traditional irrigation and is completely exposed to climatic
variations. This gives rise to the question on how to include non-irrigators when
estimating irrigation choices. We discuss results from an ordered, unordered, and
sample selection models.
The results indicate that farmers with a higher educational level, larger capital,
credit access, receiving extension services, and those who reside in the plot and in
communes with larger number of adopters are more likely to adopt modern
irrigation. On the other hand, results for production risk depend on the type of
irrigation technology. Whereas production risk promotes adoption of traditional
irrigation, it seems to be an obstacle when assessing shifts from traditional to
modern irrigation. Credit access, extension services and production variance seem
to be more important in terms of magnitude.
However, a couple of caveats deserve attention. First, given the cross-sectional
nature of our data, we are not able to fully explore dynamics in irrigation decisions.
These may be important, especially in examining the role of economic and policy
changes on adoption of modern irrigation. Second, our results may be crop-speciﬁc
since water needs are supposed to vary across different cropping activities. For
example, potato and wheat are relatively more resistant to water stress than other
crops such as rice and fruits and therefore a switch from conventional to modern
irrigation methods may be more likely to be risk-decreasing in these last cases. Even
though we did ﬁnd sufﬁcient evidence for our sample of rice farmers, data issues do
not allow us to state plausibly whether our results can be extrapolated to other
relatively more water-demanding cropping activities. Further research examining
how results vary across different crops is needed.
Despite these considerations, our ﬁndings have important implications for the
success of government interventions to address concerns of the low rate of adoption
of new irrigation technology. First, adoption of irrigation indeed reduces risk;
however, we found that farmers may experience an increase in production risk when
switching from traditional to modern irrigation methods. This increased risk may be
technological cycle. The latter prevents the full exploitation of the advantages of
modern irrigation in terms of high productivity and lower production volatility. Our
results suggest that policy interventions through extension programs providing
adoption-related information and easing access to credit are necessary to induce
faster adoption and diffusion among small-scale farmers. Second, we found
evidence in favor of sample selection correction as analyzing irrigation choices.
Therefore, controlling for pre-conditions that determine irrigation before analyzing
changes in technology is crucial to achieve a better understanding on irrigation
choices in developing countries where non-irrigators still remain as a signiﬁcant part
of the rural population. Finally, another important implication of our empirical
ﬁndings is that climate change, which is expected to increase temperature and
reduce precipitations in Chile, is likely to have a material effect on the agricultural
sector. More speciﬁcally, it may increase drought risk and therefore reduce crop
yields. Thereby, adoption of more efﬁcient irrigation technologies is crucial to
manage the higher climate risk expected for the coming years.
