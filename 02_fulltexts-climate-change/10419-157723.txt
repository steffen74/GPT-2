1 Introduction
Agricultural products have an important role in the today’s
world economy. In particular, products derived from crops
serve various customer demands, e.g., food and biofuel.
Furthermore, the supply chain of agricultural products has
become a hot issue because the public is increasingly aware
of and concerned about the availability and safety of the
foods being consumed [21]. At present, the consumers of
agricultural products demand to have more information not
only on the availability of a product in supermarkets but
also on its farming, marketing, distribution, transportation,
and processing activities [1]. Besides, consumer behavior
as such involves issues related to public health, which is
inﬂuenced by existing cases on contaminated products [20,
33]. For example, United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (US-CDC) has reported that Granny
Smith and Gala apples have to be recalled due to bacterial
contamination of Listeria monocytogenes at their packing
facility. The phenomenon not only impacts one particular
member of a supply chain, but also affects the entire supply
chain reputation. Furthermore, if the increasing demand of
an agriculture product is not supported by a good postharvest handling, agricultural waste would be a problem.
Agricultural wastes are possible to produce from harvest
wastes, i.e., stalks, straw, leaves, roots, and husks, and from
perishable leftovers and unconsumed products. Those
wastes might be potentially important resources if handled
properly [34]. The wastes are convertible into heat, steam,
charcoal, methanol, ethanol, or biodiesel. Coordination
among supply chain members may utilize and reduce

increasing farmers’ revenue. Production cost could be
reduced by utilizing buyers’ resources (technical expertise
transfer, specialized inputs, or credits to farmers). Therefore, interorganizational collaboration in a food supply
chain should be increased due to: (1) the rise of food safety
as a prominent societal issue; (2) raw materials in food
distribution often closely resemble a ﬁnal product; and (3)
agriculture products would always to varying degrees be
perishable goods [8].
The shifting behavior of agricultural consumers indicates that consumers have already known what they need
and what value that they expect from a product they buy.
Therefore, it is important for a ﬁrm to facilitate such a kind
of value creation. Under certain circumstances, a ﬁrm has
an opportunity to co-create values with its consumers. In a
value co-creation, ﬁrm and consumers interact with each
other, and they have opportunities to inﬂuence each other’s
process. Besides, Ballantyne and Varey [5] have mentioned
that ‘‘value co-creations are dialogical processes of ﬁrm
and customer that merge into one integrated process of
coordinated actions, where both parties are active, learn
together from each other and may directly inﬂuence each
other,’’ meaning that the coordination between actors in a
supply chain, especially in an agricultural one, is the key if
value co-creation is going to be implemented. The quality
of interactions between actors in the value co-creation
would affect overall supply chain performance [10, 30].
To improve the overall performance of an agricultural
supply chain, any actor in the supply chain should be able
to orchestrate its own actions; hence, each party could get
proper beneﬁts as the consequences of compromises made
during the coordination [41, 42]. The term coordination
refers to the ways of managing interdependencies between
activities, which involve different entities working together
toward a mutually deﬁned goal [26]. Its other terms, i.e.,
cooperation, integration, and collaboration, also deal with
the management of interdependencies between activities;
however, in the context of supply chain, these alternative
terms could be considered as an integral part of supply
chain coordination [6].
Supply chain coordination is a way to redesign rights to
decide, decision workﬂow, and resources among members
in a supply chain to achieve higher proﬁt margins, customer service performance improvement, and faster
response time [24]. A supply chain that implements coordination is characterized by effective communication,
information exchange, partnering, and performance monitoring [43]. In agriculture sector, coordination is critical
because one characteristic feature of agri-chains is the
dependency of value creation, particularly on features of
seasonality, perishability, safety, and traceability factors
throughout an end-to-end supply network [47, 51]. Bijman

123



et al. [8] have noted that an increased interorganizational
collaboration in food supply possibly occur due to: (1) the
rise of food safety as a prominent societal issue; (2) raw
materials in food distribution often closely resemble a ﬁnal
product; and (3) to varying degrees, foods would always be
perishable goods.
Still, research on coordination-related issues in an
agricultural supply chain is in its early development. The
research mainly focuses on the coordination of different
function within a supply chain, but may not cover coordination of the whole supply chain. A review by Ahumada
and Villalobos [1], for example, has only attempted to deal
with the production and distribution planning of agri-foods.
The review has concluded that the use of integrated planning models in an agricultural supply chain is considerably
limited. In fact, it likely occurs because an integrated
model is arguably much more complex, but may offer
greater beneﬁts compared to its complexity. The study has
mentioned that the development of production and distribution models for perishable crops is crucial for the beneﬁts of either industry or ﬁnal consumer. Moreover, a
recent review by Shukla and Jharkharia [40] has only
addressed major operational issues (e.g., demand forecasting, crop production planning, inventory management,
and transportation-related issues) that may cause postharvest wastes in fruits, ﬂowers, and vegetables. Besides, it
has concluded that only little attention is given to losses
due to inefﬁcient harvesting. Tsolakis et al. [49], on the
other hand, have discussed previous researches that have
attempted to address issues related to decision-making in
agri-food supply chains, for either crop- or non-crop-related chains, with a focus on mapping decision-making
models into strategic, tactical and operational levels, and
aim at indicating the lack of integrated supply chain design
and planning. The review has mentioned that studies,
which integrate production planning and inventory management or inventory with demand forecasting and transportation for agri-fresh produce, are considerably limited.
There is virtually no review that has discussed a holistic
view on agri-food supply chains with a particular attention
to coordination-related issues. Therefore, the current
review focuses on agri-food supply chain coordination.
Vegetables and fruits are posited as the focus of review
since these two agricultural products offer high value and
require special attention in post-harvest handling and
storage. In fact, highly perishable fruits and vegetables characteristics could increase the needs of famers and
other members of a supply chain to coordinate harvest and
delivery scheduling; hence, agricultural products would be
received by consumers in as fresh as possible condition.
The needs for post-harvest handling and storage must be
implemented by all actors in the chain to obtain higher
coordination is also critically required for being implemented, particularly to ﬁnd out any requirement for: (1)
farmers to be able to have an efﬁcient production and (2)
buyers to transfer their resources for helping farmers in
fulﬁlling their production needs.
The objective of these papers is to deﬁne the state-ofthe-art of supply chain coordination in agri-food chains and
identify research gaps in this research area. This review
aims at answering two questions: What kind of interdependencies has been developed in agri-food supply chain,
and what kind of coordination mechanism has been taken
to manage the interdependencies? These questions relate to
such aspects as the coordination perspective might differ,
which is affected by the background of each researcher,
methodology taken in a research, difﬁculties and conﬂicts
that usually appear in coordination, and coordination
mechanism taken to counter the conﬂicts.
These papers are organized as follows. The classiﬁcation
of articles being reviewed is presented in Sect. 2. Section 3
explains selection processes on the articles. In Sect. 4,
ﬁndings from the articles being reviewed are presented.
Finally, Sect. 5 provides discussions on the ﬁndings, and
Sect. 6 presents concluding review and gaps identiﬁed
among the literature under observation, all of which should
be addressed in future researches.

2 Papers classiﬁcation
To discuss agri-food supply chain coordination, the basic
concept of supply chain coordination and the speciﬁc
characteristics of agriculture sector are combined. Selected
literature is classiﬁed based on the particular content coverage and focus of each paper, i.e., the interdependencies in
an agricultural supply chain, the coordination mechanism,
and the methodology taken. Furthermore, interdependencies are analyzed by distinguishing interdependencies

Page 3 of 15 5

between activities and between actors. Coordination
mechanisms taken to manage interdependencies are classiﬁed based on the scope of coordination mechanisms for a
supply chain decision, i.e., strategic, tactical, and operational, including the effect of coordination mechanism on
supply chain performance as shown in Fig. 1.
2.1 Interdependencies
The concept of interdependencies is critical in analyzing
coordination. Malone and Crowston [26] have mentioned
that coordination refers to managing interdependencies
between activities. Besides, they have noted that when
there are no interdependencies, there is nothing to coordinate. There are two perspectives of interdependencies taken
in reviewing selected papers to investigate issues related to
coordination, i.e., the perspective of interdependencies
between activities and the perspective of interdependencies
between actors.
It should be noted that many agricultural issues are in
fact a series of linked processes or activities that involve
multiple actors, e.g., supplying agricultural inputs, cultivating, harvesting, post-harvest handling, transporting,
processing, marketing, and distributing [2]. It is important
to determine interdependencies between the activities and
among actors involved in agricultural supply chain coordination; hence, it is possible to understand whether the
coordination is only focused on different functions within a
supply chain, or focused on the whole supply chain.
2.2 Coordination mechanism
The mechanism is deﬁned as a tool or way to manage
interdependencies of activities between supply chain actors
[3]. Supply chain performance is expected to improve
through the implementation of coordination mechanisms.
There are four different types of coordination mechanisms:

Fig. 1 Overview of the classiﬁcation scheme

Supply chain contract: It is taken to manage supplier–
buyer relationships and to manage risks in a supply
chain. Several parameters are clearly speciﬁed in a
contract, i.e., quantity, price, time, and quality, when a
buyer places an order and when a supplier fulﬁlls the
order [3]. Other parameters possibly speciﬁed in a
supply chain contract include an incentive alignment.
Each decision that is made by actors in a supply chain
has its own implications. Rewards or penalties given to
particular actors according to the results of their
decision are stated as incentives. The incentive alignment itself refers to a way to resolve the conﬂict of
interest among actors in a supply chain by offering
incentive schemes that may direct their behavior to
conform to customers’ focus and total proﬁt [24, 41].
Auction, as an activity that facilitates sales of product
between supplier and buyer, is possibly placed in a
supply chain contract under ‘‘price discovery,’’ a
mechanism that gives a supplier transparency over
product price [48].
Information sharing: Lee [24] has mentioned that actors
or decision-makers in a supply chain may share their
information to avoid any distortion in the chain. Actors
in a supply chain coordinate one another by sharing
information related to demand, orders, inventory, etc.
Several studies have shown that information sharing,
supported by information technology (IT), may
improve the performance of a supply chain [11, 13,
16]. In supply chain coordination, IT is taken to
facilitate information sharing among actors in a supply
chain. In other words, coordination might be achieved
by utilizing IT [27, 35]. The utilization may help actors
in supply chains to develop an effective communication
and improve supply chain operations.
Joint decision-making: It may help actors in a supply
chain to improve their performance. It is possible
because a decision made by each actor may affect other
actors’ decisions, and a joint decision-making may
avoid conﬂicts among the actors. For example, if an
actor in a supply chain makes a decision related to a
number of promotional activities, the decision may
affect other actors’ decisions related to production and
replenishment processes. Joint decision-making is possibly implemented in replenishment [17], inventory [9],
collaborative planning [4], and logistic synchronization
[41].
Collective learning: It may solve the problem of
knowledge gap across organizations [36]. Collective
learning is required to extend the capability of partners
in accomplishing a continuous improvement [41].

In designing and managing an agri-food supply chain,
the natural hierarchy of decision-making process is

123



distinguished into strategic, tactical, and operational [1].
The coordination mechanism is one critical factor to consider in decision-making within a supply chain. Another
important thing is the effect of the implementation of
coordination mechanism to overall supply chain performance. It should be investigated to discover whether a
mechanism taken is appropriate or not to manage interdependencies in agricultural supply chain coordination.
Strategic supply chain coordination decisions are basically
long term in terms of their scope and impact. Decisions
deﬁne the direction of a supply chain. The strategic decisions involve all stakeholders who are willing to participate
in agricultural supply chain networks.
Tsolakis [49] has presented an inclusive hierarchical
decision-making framework for agriculture sector that is
useful to analyze the existing literature. Tsolakis [49] has
mentioned that strategic decisions in an agricultural supply chain are related to: the selection of farming technologies (e.g., determining capital requirements and
expenditure for any farming equipment, developing
cooperative schemes in the utilization of farming
machinery, and adopting innovative farming applications),
the development of an investment portfolio (e.g., determining investments in pivotal resources and infrastructure
and assessing alternative ﬁnancing options and optimization criteria), the fostering of supply chain partnering
relationships (e.g., determining partners’ roles, determining integration level, and establishing collaborative
schemes as well as contract types), the conﬁguration of
supply chain networks (e.g., selecting optimum sourcing
policies, developing efﬁcient procurement channels, allocating processing/production facilities, allocating intermediary warehouses, designing transportation networks,
designing retailers’ networks, and selecting markets), the
establishment of a performance measurement system (e.g.,
determining key performance indicators (KPIs), developing data-handling processes and mechanisms, selecting
and developing measuring methods, and establishing
stakeholders’ collaboration structures), the assurance of
sustainability (e.g., adopting CSR business practices,
developing waste management policies, assessing system’s sustainability, establishing carbon and water footprint control systems, adopting green farming practices,
and designing sustainable supply chain networks), and the
adoption of quality management policies (determining
quality management system scope and determining quality management system scale).
Furthermore, the implementation of supply chain or ﬁrm
strategy is related to tactical decision, while the day-to-day
running of a business is related to operational decision.
Besides, Tsolakis [49] has noted that the tactical and
operational decisions in an agricultural supply chain are
resource management), the planning of logistics operations
(e.g., ﬂeet management, planning and scheduling of vehicle
routing, identifying inventory management and control
systems, and selecting packaging conditions as well as
techniques), the support to food safety via transparency and
traceability (e.g., promoting common governance mechanisms as well as organizational arrangements and adopting
innovative tracking and tracing technologies).
2.3 Methodology
In this review, the selected literature is also distinguished
based on particular methodology taken in each research.
The methodologies are analyzed to conduct a measurement
on the impact of coordination mechanisms on performance
measures. The methodologies are categorized into mathematical modeling, statistical modeling, simulation, and
case study. Mathematical modeling attempts to deal with
mathematical concepts and language that may explain a
system, including a study on the effects of different components, and to make predictions on behavioral issues. The
second category, statistical modeling, usually refers to
mathematical equations that relate one or more random
variables and contains a set of assumptions based on
observation data. Next, simulation attempts to imitate the
operation of a real-world process or system over time.
Then, case study is an in-depth investigation on an object
of research. In a case study, every aspect of a research
object is analyzed to seek the patterns and causes of
behaviors. Methodologies taken in the literature being
reviewed would be helpful to understand agricultural supply chain coordination from different perspectives of
methodological point of view. It is to be highlighted that
any methodology taken to solve a problem depends on the
problem itself, data availability, computational resources,
and the preferences of researcher in using the particular
methodology [40].

To cover journals in operations management, agriculture, and those in adjacent ﬁelds, the Web of Science
(WOS) database is taken. Web of Science is a most used
and widely standard tool for generating citation data for
research assessment purposes. WOS database is taken as a
multidisciplinary citation resource due to its consistency
[39]; broad subject-centered coverage [22]; controlled
vocabulary and authority [39]; extensive date range that
spans 40 years [39]; guaranteed quality and accuracy [29];
stability as the oldest resource [28]; and the ability for
clients to personalize the services. Besides, it only includes
refereed contents [28]. ‘‘Supply chain coordination in
agriculture’’ is used as the primary key phrase to capture all
literature related to the concept of coordination in agri-food
supply chains. Date and journal ﬁlters are not applied.
The current structured literature review is taken to select
80 papers based on the topical relevance of each literature
to supply chain coordination in agri-food, especially fruits
and vegetables. Papers that do not contain the particular
topic are therefore excluded. Based on title relevance and a
fast screening on the papers’ abstracts, 39 among the 80
papers are further selected because they contain speciﬁcally relevant topics. The other 41 papers are excluded,
mainly because they focus on agricultural products other
than fruits or vegetables. Next, the 39 papers are screened
by reviewing the full papers. Then, forward and backward
referencing of relevant and interesting papers is taken,
which results in 16 papers to be further analyzed and
classiﬁed.

4 Findings
Papers that meet the criteria of papers selection are analyzed and classiﬁed. As aforementioned, the selected 16
papers are classiﬁed into three categories, i.e., interdependencies, coordination mechanisms, and methodology. The
analysis of each classiﬁcation is explained as follows:
4.1 Coordination based on its interdependencies

3 Papers selections
A structured literature review is applied in selecting the
papers. It is a literature review method that is particularly
focused on a research question(s) to identify, appraise,
select, and synthesize all research evidence relevant to the
question(s) [31]. First, the search for relevant literature is
conducted by using databases and citation indexes. Next,
articles being identiﬁed are brieﬂy scrutinized by checking
the titles and abstracts against predetermined criteria for
discovering their eligibility and relevance. The structured
literature review in this study is focused on the topic of
agri-food supply chain coordination.

The low number of selected papers in Table 1 shows that
studies on agri-food supply chain coordination are rarely
conducted. Besides, the publishing dates of the papers
indicate that the studies in this area are relatively new and
have just gained attention in the last recent years. However,
there is a growing interest in conducting research on this
topic. The growing interest is apparent because the selected
papers are dominated by recently published ones.
Interdependencies among actors in agri-food supply
chain based on their activities are affected by the ﬁnal
product(s) offered by the chain to end customers. For fruits
and vegetables, two kinds of ﬁnal products offered are

fresh produce and processed fruits and vegetables [18, 44].
Activity that distinguishes one another is processing,
where fresh produce does not have to go through the
process. The consequence is the shorter deterioration time
of fresh produce compared to products that have gone
through processing stage. On the contrary, the presence of
processing activity may add to the cost of supply chain and
the numbers of actors involved, making supply chain
coordination more complex. Furthermore, issues discussed
in agri-food supply chain coordination are varied. The
dominating issues are supply chain contract [12, 54] and
price mechanism [14, 37]. Other issues related to coordination deal with climate change, the use of power to create
coordination in an agri-food supply chain, coordination
mechanisms to manage interdependencies, and activities or
applications that require coordination.
The papers being reviewed illustrate all of important
activities that should be considered in an agri-food supply
chain. Activities ranging from agri-input supply to distribution and sales to end customers are discussed in these
papers. However, none gives a holistic view of supply
chain coordination in agri-food. All of them partially discuss coordination in agri-food supply chains. They only
discuss two or three parts of the chains that need to be
coordinated and do not pay attention to the entire chains. In
fact, issue as such is related to all actors involved in the
whole chain. Maintaining the relationship or coordination
between actors is hence complex, because each actor has
its own objectives or goals. Due to their limited focus and
coverage, the papers do not consider dynamic relationships
among actors in their models.
Another ﬁnding from the review is that coordination in
agri-food supply chain is in fact dominated by the coordination between farmers and processors. It suggests that
studies on the coordination of processed fruits and vegetables products have been more widely studied than the
coordination of fresh produce. Coordination has become
very important when fresh produce is associated with food
safety. Since fresh produce does not require any further
processing, it has a shorter deterioration time and is more
easily contaminated. Furthermore, there is a need for
researches on methods to help customers track and trace
fresh produce being consumed, so that food safety is
improved [53]. The survey suggests the use of radio frequency identiﬁcation (RFID) as a way to achieve more
accurate product identiﬁcation. The technology helps
actors in a supply chain share their data to one another.
Furthermore, a larger number of the reviewed papers
discuss modern channels in their supply chain than those
discussing traditional channels. It indicates that supply
chain associated with modern channels requires more
coordination than those associated with traditional ones. It
occurs because in modern channels a higher attention is

sustainability [45]. To meet these requirements, modern
channels require supply chain actors to coordinate with one
another. In addition, a study conducted by Sutopo et al.
[45] has attempted to investigate coordination between
farmers and modern retailers in handling deteriorated
products in corporate social responsibility (CSR) activities.
The CSR activities of modern channels are aimed at educating farmers to enhance their business skills and to
reduce the impact of deterioration. In modern channels,
therefore, product speciﬁcations, delivery terms, and
internal business requirements are possible to achieve.
4.2 Coordination mechanism taken in managing
interdependencies
Agri-food supply chain coordination is achieved by
applying coordination mechanisms. Supply chain contract
is the most common coordination mechanism taken in agrifood supply chains. Contracts are taken to coordinate
supply chain members to have better supplier and buyer
relationship and risk management. The contracts specify
parameters that need to be considered by farmers for fulﬁlling buyers’ demand, i.e., required area of farmland,
required number of workers, the types of vegetables to
grow, required agri-inputs such as fertilizer and seed,
quality standards, delivery dates, ﬁnancial risk allocations,
bonuses and penalties, incentive alignments, clear targets,
and result expectations.
A supply chain contract is commonly taken when
coordination in agri-food supply chain only involves two
actors. A study conducted by Kuwornu et al. [23] has
examined contract supply arrangements among farmers,
food processors, and retailers. The study attempts to assess
interactions among farmers, food processors, and retailers
by looking at contracts as well as assessing the impacts of
incentives, coordination costs, and risk strategies on
interaction. The study is conducted on the supply chain of
Dutch potatoes. It indicates that the increase in incentives
for producers and wholesalers would signiﬁcantly decrease
coordination costs in the marketing channel.
It is interesting to note that a research conducted by
Chambers and King [15] has found that supply chain
contract is not effective in maintaining the relationship
between actors regarding new types of products. In contrast, other approaches, e.g., quality monitoring, certiﬁcation-making procedures, and reputation, are found to be
highly important. The condition applies when quality
uncertainty has been a key problem, and contract
enforcement is difﬁcult due to expensive monitoring.
Furthermore, the Belaya and Henrich’s [7] work also
describes the use of power as a tool in managing supply chain
coordination in agri-food. It is rather critical than other tools

123



such as information sharing, joint decision-making, supply
chain contracts, and collective learning. In particular, the
study is aimed at ﬁnding the role of power in managing supply
chain networks and its effects on coordination. The authors
attempts to categorize power into six types and applies semistructured in-depth expert interviews with processing companies under investigation to develop a special ranking system
for the use of each type of power. Then, the study shows that
behavioral aspect is also an important aspect for being considered in a coordination process.
The other tools of coordination mechanism, i.e., information sharing, joint decision-making, and collective
learning, are also taken to promote a harmonious relationship and to solve conﬂicts between actors in an agrifood supply chain, as discussed by Sutopo et al. [45],
Usuga et al. [50], Villegas et al. [52], and Zylbersztajn and
Miele [54].
Several authors have identiﬁed that more than one type
of coordination mechanism might be taken to maintain
coordination within a supply chain of agri-foods [50, 54].
The authors argue that more than one coordination mechanisms could be required because agri-food supply chain is
a multistage activity and may act as enabling activities that
involve more than two actors with different objectives and
characteristics.
The effects on supply chain performance, when a
coordination mechanism is being implemented, are varied,
e.g., cost reduction, proﬁt increase, quality improvement,
higher productivity, food safety improvement, real
knowledge basis construction, and long-term relationship
maintenance. However, not all reviewed papers show how
the effect is measured. Most of these papers only look at
the effects of a coordination mechanism that has been
successfully implemented in a particular case and assume
that the same effects would occur if the same coordination
mechanism is applied to another case.
The implementation of decision-making level of coordination mechanism varies in strategic, tactical, and operational levels. As Table 2 shows coordination mechanism
is dominated by the application of supply chain contracts,
usually relating to tactical and operational decisions [12,
23, 44, 46, 50, 54]. In contrast, the supply chain contract
for a strategic level receives little attention. Only one paper
utilizes supply chain contracts or agreements in their supply chain to maintain its long-term relationship [18]. The
paper suggests that it is necessary to make agreements
among supply chain members for gaining conﬁdence of
other supply chain members and for having clear targets
and expectation about the results of a long-term relationship. On the other hand, other coordination mechanisms are
dominated by the implementation at operational level.

4.3 Methodology taken in addressing
interdependencies and assessing coordination
mechanism
The most common methodology taken to describe supply
chain coordination in agri-food chains is the case study.
Seven of 16 papers focus on particular case studies. In

addition, case studies are often taken to describe the process of coordination that occurs in an agri-food supply
chain. The approach may give an overview on the ﬁeld but
may hardly provide alternative solutions applicable for
agri-food supply chain coordination.
In fact, researches on agri-food supply chain coordination are dominated by the use of mathematical modeling as

a methodology to address interdependencies and assess
coordination mechanism. Most of these analytical approaches utilize deterministic variables and cannot accommodate the speciﬁc characteristics of agricultural products.
The papers that contain an analytical approach investigate
the coordination between two supply chain actors [12, 14].
Then, simulation is a less preferred approach in agrifood supply chain coordination. There is only one work in
which simulation approach is utilized [52]. Villegas et al.
[52] have simulated and analyzed climate change impacts
on agriculture and could ﬁnally propose a set of adaptation
measures to be considered in determining the purpose of
supply chain coordination in agri-food sector. However,
simulation approach in the study is not taken to show the
process of coordination that occurs between actors
involved in the agri-food supply chain under investigation
and do not provide an alternative coordination mechanism
to manage supply chain coordination. The detail list of
methodology taken in addressing interdependencies and
assessing coordination mechanism is shown in Table 3.

5 Discussion
Interdependencies in agri-food supply chain require a clear
deﬁnition to provide a complete description on the focus of
coordination, including any actor involved in the coordination. The ﬁndings discovered in this literature review indicate

123

a research gap that is potential for being taken to identify
future researches required for studying agricultural supply
chain coordination. In particular, potential researches in
agricultural supply chain coordination include investigations
on consumer requirements, behavioral aspects, and a combination of hard and soft approach taken as the research
methodology. From the ﬁndings related to interdependencies,
several analyses could be derived. Based on the interdependencies, one may determine whether or not a study is focused
on coordination that involves the whole or only several stages
in a supply chain. Interdependencies between stages may also
determine the purpose or focus of coordination.
Furthermore, analyses on interdependencies from previous studies indicate actors who are involved and the role
of each actor in the interdependencies within an agri-food
supply chain. There are no papers that explain the characteristics of actors within agri-food supply chain in detail.
Those characteristics are required to investigate any
determining coordination mechanism taken in managing
interdependencies. Folkerts and Koehorst [18] have shown
that coordination between actors in agri-food supply chains
varies and is highly dependent on historical and cultural
aspects as well as on a regulatory environment. There is
also clear evidence on opportunistic behavior, wherein
individual actors would only work together as long as there
are clear and tangible beneﬁts. Therefore, a study on
coordination process, particularly to analyze coordination
required since the characteristics of a supply chain and
farmers’ behavior may make agri-food supply chain more
complex. Moreover, as aforementioned in the ﬁndings
section, studies on supply chain coordination in agri-food
sector with a particular focus on small-scale farmers have
not yet been well developed. Therefore, there is a lot of
opportunities to conduct in-depth studies on agri-food
supply chain coordination that involves small-scale farmers. For instance, a study may focus on values in coordination that should be delivered by small-scale farmers to
fulﬁll consumer requirements, e.g., the quality and availability of agricultural products required by consumers.
Furthermore, the ﬁndings indicate that studies in analyzing a coordination process in an agricultural supply
chain still lag behind, particularly ones related to either
operational level of modern marketing channel or smallscale farmers. The process of coordination requires a more
insightful and more detailed description. The process itself
is related to interdependencies between stages in an agricultural supply chain, e.g., the processing of agri-inputs,
the distribution of agricultural products, and the delivery of
products to customers. Either the behavior or the characteristics of each actor need to be considered when analyzing a coordination process. Besides, the speciﬁc
characteristics of an agricultural product need to be considered in a coordination process to obtain a more realistic
description on the real conditions and situation in agricultural supply chain coordination [40].
The purpose of maintaining interdependencies or coordination between actors requires a further identiﬁcation. In
today’s highly competitive era, the purpose should be
based on consumer requirements. The ﬁndings have indicated that there is no study on agricultural supply chain
coordination that has attempted to consider consumer
requirements. The consumer’s role has already been shifted, e.g., from isolated to connected, from unaware to
informed, and from passive to active [32]. As the consequence, in maintaining interdependencies, any activity
performed by each actor should have values that may fulﬁll
consumer requirements. It is achievable by adopting a
value co-creation concept. In the concept, consumers act as
key actors who have to be involved in the system to
improve the overall performance of an agricultural supply
chain.
Prahalad and Ramaswamy [32] have noted that the
collaboration between a ﬁrm and its customers in implementing value co-creation may improve efﬁciencies and
increase proﬁts in a long run. The collaboration may begin
with a market-based transaction, which requires a ﬁrm to
work closely with its suppliers and key customers within a
network. The next step in collaboration requires information sharing. In the step, a greater level of trust or incentive

Page 11 of 15 5

is needed. Next, tasks and modalities in the collaboration
would be more complex in which they require a ﬁrm to
assess collaborative capacities. Moreover, Bonney et al.
[10] have suggested that a partnership between ﬁrms that
develop co-innovation has more opportunities for innovation in process, product, or service through a continuous
improvement in the activation of Research and Development (R&D) and New Product Development (NPD) divisions. Besides, the study concludes that the R&D and NPD
of a ﬁrm should take consumer value into account rather
than simply focus on what is feasible to implement by the
ﬁrm.
Moreover, looking at the analysis on interdependencies
in previous studies, coordination mechanisms are suggested to manage interdependencies between stages and
between actors in an agricultural supply chain. Coordination mechanism is chosen based on activities to be managed and the characteristics of actors involved in a
coordination process. Then, a chosen coordination mechanism is analyzed to make sure that it is the most suitable coordination mechanism that may improve the overall
performance of an agricultural supply chain. Choosing and
implementing the coordination mechanism have to consider behavioral aspects. In a decision-making process,
rational behavior is not always referred. Most decisionmakers use heuristics, which may lead to a biased decision,
in their decision-making process, contributing to the poor
performance of an agricultural supply chain [19]. The
development of a coordination process in an agricultural
supply chain model is an immediate need not only for the
beneﬁt of the industry but also for the beneﬁt of end consumers. The use of a combination between soft and hard
approaches is required to explain a coordination process in
an agricultural supply chain.
Methodologies taken in the papers being reviewed are
dominated by the hard aspects of coordination, which focus
on optimization and quantitative results. On the other hand,
the soft aspect of coordination focusses on the details of
coordination, e.g., what are the motivations of each member of an agricultural supply chain to coordinate with other
members, what kind of interdependencies that occur
between supply chain members so that a coordination is
needed, how to analyze which coordination mechanism is
suitable to the interdependencies, and what kind of conﬂicts that occur in the process of coordination. These soft
aspects of coordination would result in a comprehensive
qualitative result, which is important as a basis of knowledge before the hard aspects of coordination are analyzed.
As aforementioned by Malone and Crowston [26], different types or levels of interdependencies are useful for
identifying coordination mechanism. Besides, some of the
papers being reviewed have mentioned that the use of a
coordination mechanism also depends on the level of


Fig. 2 Spectrum of
coordination mechanism based

requirements

quality requirements demanded by customers. For example, Chambers and King’s [15] and Stringer and Sang’s
[44] works have attempted to deﬁne different types of
contracts based on the levels of product speciﬁcations.
Looking at the explanation above, it is apparent that any
coordination mechanism taken in agricultural supply chain
coordination can be derived by considering two determinants, i.e., interdependencies and quality requirements. The
level of interdependencies between actors indicates a different intensity of interaction and communication. The
higher the interdependencies would indicate an increased
level of communication. Besides, it indicates that an active
interaction is required in the process of coordination within
an agricultural supply chain. In addition, the level of
interdependencies also shows how many actors in a supply
chain need to integrate their agricultural activities, which
span from agri-input, cultivation, harvesting, post-harvest,
transportation, processing, and marketing, to distribution.
Moreover, the level of quality requirement indicates the
level of difﬁculties to achieve or fulﬁll customer requirements. A low level of quality requirement indicates willingness of customers to buy standard products. On the
other hand, a high level of quality requirement indicates
customers’ willingness to buy agricultural products with a
speciﬁc set of requirements according to the appearance of
agri products, e.g., size, color, freshness, traceability, and
safety from product contamination.
According to the level of interdependencies and the
level of quality requirement, the papers can be mapped
based on the coordination mechanism taken (see Fig. 2).
Spectrum 1 shows the lowest level of interdependencies
and the lowest level of quality requirement that do not need

123

any speciﬁc coordination mechanism. In fact, it only
requires market mechanism. Market mechanism illustrates
the simplest transaction between a supplier and a buyer:
When there is product, there is money, meaning that any
product produced and offered would surely be sold in the
market. Next spectrum shows the higher level of quality
requirement but does not need higher interdependencies or
interactions between actors or activities in an agri-food
supply chain. This spectrum is manageable by utilizing
information sharing as the coordination mechanism.
However, information sharing in this spectrum only applies
for basic information possibly exchanged using electronic
data interchange. Some other papers mention power as a
coordination mechanism that can be used for low interdependencies and a higher-quality requirement. The coordination mechanism is useful to implement the action plan of
coordination.
Furthermore, the Spectrum 2 illustrates that for a higherquality requirement than the Spectrum 1 with low interdependencies, a simple contract can be used as the coordination mechanism. The simple contract usually applies
orally or written, which only consists of quantity and
quality demanded by a buyer, without any detailed
requirement. In the same spectrum, a simple collective
learning, i.e., counseling and training, can be implemented
to deal with a higher-quality requirement and low interdependencies. A simple collective learning illustrates the
need to fulﬁll certain quality requirements for a speciﬁc
agricultural product with helps from others to bridge the
knowledge gap of farmers in implementing good agricultural practices. Then, the Spectrum 3 illustrates the need for
communication among actors in an agri-food supply chain;
however, it may not always have to fulﬁll high-quality
requirements for customers. The last spectrum, 4, shows
high-quality requirements for being fulﬁlled by high
interdependencies. Highly speciﬁc contract and information sharing for data integration can be used for condition
as such. However, a higher speciﬁc quality requirement of
agricultural products requires more interactions and interdependencies between actors in a supply chain, which can
be accommodated by applying collective learning as a tool
for value co-creation. After analyzing all selected papers,
there are no papers that discuss the Spectrum 3, which
implements value co-creation mechanism in agri-food
supply chain coordination.

6 Conclusions
An assessment of the gaps in the existing literatures on
agri-food supply chain coordination is presented in this
paper. Previous studies on agriculture supply chain coordination have been surveyed and classiﬁed, and the needs
for future researches have been identiﬁed. Studies analyzing coordination process in agri-food supply chains still lag
behind, particularly when a supply chain is strongly associated with the operational level of modern marketing
channels and small-scale farmers.
A holistic view on coordination in agri-food supply
chain is required, particularly when it is focused on the
process of coordination. Besides, the process should be
explained deeper and in detail. A coordination process
itself is related to interdependencies between stages in an
agri-food supply chain, e.g., agri-input activities, agriproduct distributions and ﬁnal delivery to end customers.
Furthermore, the process should adopt value co-creation
concept, and hence, any activity performed by actors in a
supply chain would have values that meet the requirements
of consumers. Then, actors and their characteristics need to
be considered when analyzing a coordination process.
On the other hand, the speciﬁc characteristics of an agriproduct also need to be considered in a coordination process
to develop a more realistic description on the real condition
and situation in an agri-food supply chain. Looking from the
viewpoint of interdependency, coordination mechanisms
are chosen to manage interdependencies between stages and
between actors in an agri-food supply chain. A coordination
mechanism is chosen based on activities to be managed and
the characteristics of actors involved in a coordination
process. Then, the mechanism is analyzed further to make
sure that it is the most suitable coordination mechanism for
improving the overall performance of an agri-food supply
chain. The development of appropriate coordination

processes in agri-food supply chain models is clearly
required, by which the result would beneﬁt the industry and
end consumers. Moreover, the spectrums of coordination
mechanism may help practitioners in the agriculture sector
to improve their supply chain performance by implementing a proper coordination.
Then, the soft aspects of coordination are potential for
being analyzed in future researches to capture the detailed
process of coordination, to analyze conﬂicts and barriers that
occur in the process of coordination, and to implement
coordination mechanisms to improve the performance of the
whole supply chain. Moreover, the current practices of
agriculture strongly focus on products, meaning that a
stronger focus on delivering products to customers is
required. The innovative capability of different stakeholders
(members in a supply chain) is clearly required to provide
customers with multiple new offerings. The members are
supposed to make their customers aware that an involvement
in value co-creation can surely increase their beneﬁts.
