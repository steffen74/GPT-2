INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND

The global market for the industrial gas sector was
approximately $77 billion in 2014 and is projected to
increase to $116.6 billion in 2020 (Industry Experts,
2014). Industrial gas companies typically have
significant investments in their distribution systems and
strive to improve operational efficiency throughout their
supply chains.
Industrial gases can be distributed via pipelines,
delivered to customers as packaged gases, or transported
in bulk via truck, rail, or ship. The focus of this research
is bulk distribution, which accounts for approximately
34% of revenue in this industry (Baker and Garvey,
2004). For gases that are transported by cryogenic trailers
to bulk tanks at customer sites, industrial gas producers
often implement a vendor managed inventory (VMI)
system with their customers. The producers are
responsible for inventory management as well as gas
delivery to customer sites. Customers assume ownership
of the gas inventory once it is delivered to the tanks
located at their sites. The industrial gas producer
generally owns and monitors the tanks and replenishes
the tanks using cryogenic trailers. These trailers and
storage tanks are generally high value assets and their
effective utilization is important for the company. Also,
industrial gas producers must meet strict customer
service levels while coping with demand fluctuations.
Thus, efficient distribution is a main driver to achieve
lower costs and remain competitive (Chowhan, 2013).
When distributing gases, tractor-trailers
(referred to by trailers in the remainder of this work)
typically depart their depots, obtain liquefied products at
gas sources, and deliver the gas product to bulk tanks at
one or more customer sites. The trailers may either return
to the depot and conclude the route or may obtain
has the opportunity to serve additional customers before
concluding a route. Common route construction
approach, however, primarily consider depots and
customer nodes. Thus, existing route construction
methods are extended to accommodate depots, sources,
customer nodes and continuous deliver.
The customer tank size is a determining factor
for the quantity and volume of deliveries that a customer
requires. Generally, customers with small tanks and high
demand require more frequent replenishments of smaller
volumes. Allocating a larger tank to such customers may
improve distribution efficiency by requiring fewer
replenishment deliveries in larger quantities. Assigning
large tanks to all customers, however, is not feasible
when considering limited tank resources, associated
costs, and budgets restrictions. When determining the
preferred tank for a customer site, industrial gas
producers consider estimated consumption patterns,
safety stock requirements of each customer, and
proximity to other customers. Swapping tanks between
customers involves removing a tank from one customer
site, moving it to a tank warehouse, refurbishing it,
transporting it to another customer location, and
installing it at the new location. This is an expensive
process which is justified only if the benefits of a more
efficient distribution plan exceed the costs of tank
exchanges. Therefore, considering the significant
investment in bulk tanks, industrial gas companies face
an important strategic level decision of bulk tank
allocation which directly affects the operational
efficiency of their distribution networks.
In practice, bulk tanks are typically allocated to
customer sites for multiple years. The bulk tank
allocation (BTA) decision is further complicated by
customer demand that frequently varies by time period
(e.g. quarterly). Thus, it is important (and challenging) to
allocate tanks that effectively accommodate time varying
demand. Installing proper size tanks at customer
locations not only provides improved utilization of their
assets (bulk tanks and vehicle fleet) but also better
service quality to their customers. This research is
motivated by Air Liquide, a leading international gas
company, that produces and distributes industrial gases
such as hydrogen, oxygen, argon, helium, carbon
dioxide, and nitrogen for several business segments in
over eighty countries.
The main contributions of this paper include: 1)
the formulation of a mixed-integer programming model
of the bulk tank allocation problem with time varying
demand, 2) development of a solution approach to
address the bulk tank allocation problem with time
varying demand that also generates a gas distribution
plan; 3) incorporation of multiple sources and continuous
routes where tractor trailers visit the same or a different

source for refilling during gas delivery to customers,
which is used in practice, into our methodology; 4)
validation of the approach and analysis of solutions using
industry representative data sets; and 5) managerial
insights on potential total cost savings and distribution
savings as well as internal rate of return on tank
investments.
In the following section, we briefly review the
related literature and formally describe a mixed-integer
programming (MIP) model for the bulk tank allocation
with time varying (BTATVD) problem. Then, we
evaluate the model formulation and explore
modifications to improve the solvability of the model. In
section 4, we describe a route generation procedure to
generate a set of high quality delivery routes quickly and
discuss the modifications that we made to the previously
developed routing subproblem. The generated routes are
then used in three solution approaches proposed in
section 5. The three solution approaches include solving
a BTATVD restricted master problem (RMP), BTATVD
with recurring demand assumption, and a two phase
periodically restricting heuristic (PRH). The developed
methodologies are demonstrated using modified data sets
provided by Air Liquide in section 6, followed by a
scalability analysis in section 7. We close with
conclusions and our future research directions in section 8.

LITERATURE SURVEY

The bulk tank allocation (BTA) problem involves the
allocation or reallocation of bulk tanks to customer sites
in order to minimize the sum of the net present value of
investment costs in the logistics network and distribution
costs over a time horizon. The BTA problem involves
resource allocation with an underlying split delivery
vehicle routing problem (SDVRP). SDVRP is a
generalized vehicle routing problem (VRP) in which a
customer’s demand can be satisfied from multiple
vehicle visits rather than just one. The SDVRP can also
be viewed as a special case of the inventory routing
problem (IRP) with known demand where no back orders
are allowed.
In a classic VRP, a set of customers with known
demand is served by a fleet of vehicles. The objective is
to minimize the total travel cost while ensuring that each
customer’s demand is satisfied by exactly one vehicle
visit. In a SDVRP, the restriction of one visit for each
customer is relaxed, and a customer’s demand can be
fulfilled by several deliveries on multiple vehicles routes.
SDVRP provides the set of delivery routes and
determines the amount to deliver to each customer on
each vehicle route. This problem was first proposed in the
literature by Dror and Trudeau (1989), where they show
the potential cost savings through split deliveries in a
VRP.
the mathematical formulation along with analysis of the
properties and complexity of the problem. They review
exact solution approaches for solving a SDVRP for small
instances of the problem including a dynamic
programming model (Lee et al., 2006), a two-stage
solution approach including iteratively solving
assignment problems and traveling salesman problems
(Jin et al., 2007), and an approach based on a set covering
formulation of the problem and a column generation
approach (Feillet et al., 2004). Archetti et al. (2011)
propose a branch-and-price-and-cut scheme for solving
SDVRP. They use column generation approach to
generate routes and determine delivery amounts in the
subproblem using a labeling algorithm and then master
problem selects the optimal routes.
Archetti and Speranza (2008) also review some
effective heuristics that have been designed and tested on
larger data sets. They compare the performance of major
heuristics available in the literature on several instances
ranging from 50 to 199 customers. More recently, several
metaheuristic approaches are proposed by Aleman and
Hill (2010), Aleman et al. (2010), and Derigs et al. (2010)
to solve the SDVRP. Most of the SDVRP literature
reports solving instances with less than 200 customers.
The additions of tank allocation decisions along with
time varying customer demand introduce additional
complexity to the problem. Therefore, an efficient
heuristic approach is necessary for solving the problem.
In general, the IRP involves the integration and
coordination of two components of the logistics systems:
inventory management and vehicle routing. It is
concerned with the distribution of products from
facilities to a set of customers over a given planning
horizon. Customers consume the product and can
maintain an inventory of the product up to a certain level.
A fleet of vehicles of known capacities are available for
the distribution of the product. The objective is to
minimize the distribution and inventory costs during the
planning period. If there are no back orders allowed in
the IRP, the problem will be similar to the SDVRP. The
problem studied in this research shares similarities with
the IRP. Thus, literature on IRP is reviewed to provide
insights.
In a survey paper, Moin and Salhi (2006)
present a logistical overview of the IRP and classify the
papers into single-period, multi-period, infinite time
horizon, and problems with stochastic demand. Singleperiod models are popular in the literature, as they are
simpler to solve and often provide a basis for solving
multi-period models. The multi-period models are often
used for long term planning as they better capture the
trade-offs between short-term and long-term decisions.
While multi-period models provide a more realistic
representation of the problem, they are more complex

3

and therefore most of the papers consider deterministic
demand for the customers and solve the problem using
heuristic methods. Some research has been published on
stochastic IRP (see Bard et al. (1998); Kleywegt et al.
(2002, 2004)). Campbell et al. (1998) discuss the
complexity and practical issues of the IRP with stochastic
demand and present different solution approaches.
In a more recent paper, Bertazzi et al. (2008)
review the inventory routing literature and discuss the
characteristics and complexity of the problem and
describe the challenges encountered when trying to
simultaneously minimize the inventory holding and
routing costs. Andersson et al. (2010) also provide a
comprehensive survey of over 90 scientific papers for
IRP where one party in the supply chain is responsible
for transportation and inventory management. The papers
are categorized by time horizon into the following three
categories: instant time horizon, finite time horizon, and
infinite time horizon. The papers are compared with
respect to problem description, assumptions, and solution
approaches proposed in major papers within each
category. In most of the cases, the complexity of the
problem makes it difficult to solve to optimality and
heuristic or decomposition approaches are often
employed. For most industry-sized problems, a
computational time limit is enforced for exact
approaches and then the best integer solution found is
reported or a heuristic has been implemented. They
emphasize the importance of using advanced decision
support tool for inventory management and routing
decisions for businesses with complex systems, but found
no commercial decision support tools available for the
combined inventory management and routing problem.
Thus, optimization-based decision support systems are
needed for the IRP. Aksoy and Derbez (2003) survey the
available software systems for supply chain management.
They identify 160 software companies providing supply
chain management software. Among these they find
several software systems that have separate modules for
inventory management and routing, but no software
systems where it is combined.
While there is abundant research on the SDVRP
and relevant cases of IRP, minimal research was found
that integrates this problem with tank allocation for the
industrial gas industry. Ellis et al. (2014), You et al.
(2011a), and You et al. (2011b) are among the few
researchers addressing this problem.
Ellis et al. (2014) develop a mixed-integer
programming (MIP) model which minimizes the net
present value of gas distribution over a horizon, tank
installation, tank reallocation, tank refurbishment, and
tank purchasing costs. The model captures complex
trade-offs between strategic level investment decisions
and operational level routing decisions. They also
develop a decomposition-based heuristic solution
estimates of distribution costs using the sweep-based
heuristic compared closely to the actual distribution costs
in practice. This approach was evaluated using several
data sets ranging from a small data set involving a single
depot with 5-10 customers to a larger national data set
with 18 depots and 1287 customers provided by Air
Liquide. The result of the solution approach is an
allocation of tanks to customer sites and an estimate of
the investment and distribution costs.
You et al. (2011a) address an inventorydistribution planning problem in industrial gas
distribution, including bulk tank allocation. The bulk
tank allocation problem is modeled as a large scale MIP
model to minimize investment costs, change-out costs,
and distribution costs. They propose heuristic solution
approaches, with a primary focus on a continuous
approximation approach. With the continuous
approximation approach, detailed vehicle routing
parameters and variables are approximated by functions
to represent the distribution of customer demands and
locations, thus simplifying some aspects of the problem.
When included in the model, however, the functions
result in a mixed integer nonlinear problem (MINLP).
The problem is then linearized and applied to select tank
sizes. A comparison of the continuous approximation
distribution costs with detailed routing distribution costs
is not provided.
You et al. (2011b) continue exploration of
inventory-distribution problems in industrial gas
distribution. In this paper, the bulk tank allocation
problem considers uncertain customer demand and the
loss or addition of new customers with an objective to
minimize investment costs, tank change-out costs, and
distribution costs. For this problem, customer demand
fluctuations are assumed to follow a normal distribution.
Customer demand can vary by year, but seasonal demand
within a year is not considered. They present a stochastic
MINLP model, which relies on a continuous
approximation approach. The paper primarily focuses on
the computational aspects of the stochastic MINLP
model, with problem instances varying from 4 to 200
customers. A comparison of the continuous
approximation distribution costs with the detailed routing
distribution costs is not provided.
The approaches presented by Ellis et al. (2014)
and You et al. (2011a) assume constant demand for
customers. In reality, customer demand frequently varies
by time period, often with seasonal variations. If the tank
allocation decisions were made each time period then the
problem would decompose by time period. In practice,
however, bulk tanks that are allocated to customer sites
typically remain in place for multiple years. Throughout
this paper, the study time horizon is the time period in
which customers’ allocated tanks are assumed to remain

fixed for the purpose of distribution cost savings. Given
that customer demand tends to vary, the challenge is to
allocate tanks effectively to accommodate time varying
demand during the study time horizon. Considering the
significant costs involved in exchanging tanks, a tank
exchange is only justifiable if the net present value of the
resulting distribution cost savings over the study time
horizon outweighs the tank allocation costs. Therefore,
we extend the previous model of Ellis et al. (2014) to
consider changing demands by period for each customer,
resulting in the bulk tank allocation model for time
varying demand (BTATVD). Introducing this new
dimension to the problem increases complexity, and
therefore, we investigate three approaches for addressing
the problem including a periodically restricting heuristic
(PRH) solution approach. The three approaches are
compared and their effectiveness is evaluated.

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION

We consider an industrial gas distribution network for a
single gas product distributed by trailers from multiple
gas sources. The industrial gas company assigns bulk
tanks to the customers and deliver the products to these
tanks. The customers assume ownership of the delivered
product but the tank itself is owned by the industrial gas
company. Tank allocation is an expensive process that
involves the costs of purchasing new tanks or
refurbishing existing tanks, transporting the tanks, and
installing them at customer location. The tanks, which
are assumed to be allocated at the beginning of the time
horizon, directly affect distribution planning. Each
customer must be assigned a tank that is large enough to
hold each delivery plus the safety stock requirement of
that customer. Smaller tanks generally require more
frequent but smaller deliveries. In different time periods,
a customer may be replenished on different routes. For
example, in a high demand period, a customer may be
visited on a direct route if the customer has a tank large
enough to receive a full trailer load. Delivery to the same
customer may be combined with others such that the
customer is replenished on a multiple customer route in
a time period with lower demand. Note that the high
demand period for one customer may be the low demand
period for another.
The industrial gas company is assumed to own
a homogeneous feet of trailers with a given capacity to
distribute products to customers, and sufficient trailers
are available to deliver gas products. Trailers start at
depots, obtain product from gas sources, and then deliver
the gas to customers assigned to those depots and
sources. Trailers can provide continuous delivery by
visiting sources in between deliveries to refill their tanks.
In this context, the entire tour from depot departure to
arrival back at the depot is referred to as a route, and the
sources and depots. The initial number of tanks available
in the tank warehouse is known as well as a budget for
purchasing new tanks and refurbishing existing tanks
located at customer locations. We assume that customer
demand for each period is given and each customer is
replenished from the depot to which it is assigned.
The model minimizes the sum of the initial cost
of tank installation, tank transportation from the
warehouse, tank refurbishment, and new tank purchase
cost and the present value of the periodic distribution
costs in each time period. Other costs associated with
production, inventory holding, and back order costs are
not considered in this study as our main focus is on tank
allocation and product transportation costs involved in
distribution planning. To account for customer demand
variability the time horizon is divided into shorter, equal,
independent, time periods (e.g. months or quarters). The
challenge is to allocate an expensive resource over a long
time horizon (e.g., 7 years) while accommodating
customer demand that potentially fluctuates over each
time period (e.g., months or quarters). Although the focus
of this study is for a single gas type, the model is
adaptable for multiple gas types. The objective is to
assign tanks to customer sites to minimize the tank
installation, tank reallocation, tank refurbishment, and
tank purchasing costs over a time horizon and the present
value of gas distribution costs. The primary assumptions
of the model are highlighted below.
Assumptions:
• Locations of customers, depots, and tank warehouses
are known.
• Customer demands and required safety stocks are
known for each time period (e.g., quarterly) in the study
time horizon (e.g., seven years).
• Customer demand is constant during a time period but
may vary across time periods.
• Customer demand must be satisfied in each time
period.
• The industrial gas producer owns the tanks that are
allocated to customer sites. Customers assume
ownership of the gas product upon delivery.
• The capacity and quantity of each tank type, which is
either assigned to a customer or available in the tank
warehouse, is known.
• Tanks that are currently at customer sites or available
in the tank warehouse can be allocated or reallocated,
and new tanks can be purchased if necessary at the
beginning of the time horizon. Tanks remain in place
throughout the time horizon.
• Swapping tanks between customers involves removing
a tank from one customer site, moving it to a tank
warehouse, refurbishing it, transporting it to another
customer location, and installing it at the new

5

location.
• Allocating a tank from the warehouse to a customer
also involves refurbishment costs, transportation costs,
and tank change out costs.
• The capacity and quantity of the homogeneous
delivery trailers are known.
• The relevant costs are known, including delivery cost
per distance, fixed access cost at customer sites, tank
installation costs, refurbishment costs, and purchase
costs.
• The duration of each route must comply with the
mandatory maximal working hours of drivers, and the
aggregated duration of all of the selected routes must
not exceed the product of the length of each time
period and the number of trailers.
• The budget limits for tank procurement and tank
refurbishment are known.

strategic level investment decisions and operational level
routing decisions. The model simultaneously allocates
tank types, selects distribution routes from a set of
candidate routes, and determines delivery amounts. For a
set of all potential routes, the problem is formulated as

The objective function (1) minimizes the net
present value of the recurring distribution costs and onetime tank installation, tank transportation from the
warehouse, tank refurbishment, and tank purchase costs.
Constraint set (2) ensures that the number of tanks of type
t moved from the warehouse does not exceed the
warehouse inventory and the tanks returned to the
warehouse. For each customer i, with a new assigned tank
type t, the tank can be either obtained from the warehouse
or newly purchased, as stated by constraint set (3).
Constraint sets (4) and (5) ensure that the budget limits
for tanks refurbishment and procurement are not
exceeded. Each customer i must be assigned a tank, as
stated by constraint set (6). Constraint set (7) ensures
that the amount of each delivery to customer i on trip s
in period q plus the safety stock requirements for that
customer does not exceed the allocated tank mass
capacity. Constraint set (8) ensures that the amount
delivered to all the customers on trip s in each period is
less than or equal to the trailer capacity, g, when the route
containing trip s is selected, or zero otherwise. The
delivery amounts to customer i across all routes r in each
period q must meet the requirements for customer i in
that period, as enforced by constraint set (9). Constraint
set (10) ensures that the amount of gas delivered to
customer i on trip s in period q is less than or equal to the
minimum of the trailer capacity or the largest tank size
less the safety stock for customer i, or zero if customer i
is not visited on trip s in period q. The minimum number
of visits required to the customer site in period q, is
determined by the requirements for customer i divided
by the trailer capacity or the requirements for customer i
divided by the tank capacity less the safety stock (all

rounded up), as stated in constraint set (11). Constraint
set (12) ensures that the time required for all the selected
routes in each time period does not exceed the length of
the time period κ multiplied by the number of available
vehicles, kp, for each depot p. Constraint set (13) ensures
that routes with duration longer than the maximum
allowable time for a route are not selected. Constraint set
(14) represents the logical restrictions on the decision
variables.
Moreover, the cost for route r ∈ R to be
executed by a trailer includes the cost to access customer
sites and the cost to transport the gas on the distribution
route. This cost is defined as follows:

ROUTE GENERATION

In the BTATVD model formulation, set R includes all the
possible routes that start at a depot, visit a source, deliver
to at least one customer, and return to the depot. The
number of routes for each period increases exponentially
as the number of customers increases, which results in an
intractable problem even for a small to moderate sized
Two types of routes are generated: singlecustomer routes that contain a direct trip from a depot to
a customer and back to the depot, and multiple-customer
routes in which more than one customer is visited on a
route. To generate the multiple-customer routes, the
customers are clustered and ordered using a sweep
heuristic. The algorithm is an adaptation of the sweep and
petal methods used to solve VRP (Gillett and Miller,
1974; Ryan et al., 1993). For each depot, the customers
are first sorted by corresponding polar coordinates. Then
the customers are added to a cluster according to the
polar coordinates using either a clockwise or counter
clockwise direction until the total residual partial
demands in a cluster reaches the trailer capacity. A
traveling salesman problem (TSP) can be solved to
generate the sequence of customer visits in each cluster.
For this implementation, however, the sequence of
customer visits is based on the order the customers are
added to the cluster. The cluster and route generation
process is repeated for all of the depots and sources. The
output is a set of routes with their corresponding cost and
duration which are input to the restricted bulk tank
allocation problem to determine the allocation of bulk
tanks to customer sites. To ensure feasibility, multiple
copies of the generated routes are input to the bulk tank
allocation model.
Estimating the product delivery cost plays a
pivotal role in the bulk tank allocation decisions. The
more accurate the estimate of the cost to serve a
customer, the easier it is to determine the effect of a tank
change on the overall distribution network. To more
thoroughly represent the industrial gas distribution
practices, we extend the routing approach of Ellis et al.
(2014) by differentiating between depots and gas sources
and considering the industry practice of continuous
delivery.

• Depots and sources: The routing subproblem in Ellis
et al. (2014) generates candidate routes assuming
depots and sources are co-located such that a full
trailer departs from a depot, delivers product to up to
five customers, and then returns to the depot. In reality,
a depot is the location in which trailers park and
receive maintenance. In order to deliver product,
trailers must first obtain liquefied product from a
source, which may or may not be co-located with the
depot. Customers may have additional product
requirements such as purity of product provided by
certain sources. The allocation of customers to sources
is provided as input to ensure that these requirements
are met.
• Continuous delivery: The consideration of sources
allows for the possibility for a trailer to refill product
during a delivery route. Under certain circumstances,
a trailer may refill at a source and serve additional
customers before returning to the depot. Modeling this
continuous delivery practice provides a more reflective
estimate of the distribution costs in practice. Two
common delivery practices considered in the network
are shown in Figure 1. A trailer following the route (a)
fills at source S1, visits two customers, refills at source
S1, then delivers to three more customers before
returning to the depot. A trailer following route (b)
fills at source S1, visits two customers, refills at source
S2, then delivers to three customers before returning
to the depot. Note that in route (b), only customers
assigned to receive product from this different source
may be considered after refill.
When generating routes for the model to
evaluate, we incorporate this continuous delivery
practice. A trailer obtains product from a source, then it
begins a polar sweep to add additional customers to the
trip. Eventually, the trailer may consider refilling on
product if the product level is below a threshold.

nearest the trailer’s current location. If this source is
different from the last one, the trailer refills on product
and proceeds to serve customers assigned to this new
source.
The objective of the route generation module is
to generate a set of high quality feasible routes quickly.
Details of the route generation approach are presented in
Appendix 1. The generated routes along with their
associated costs and duration are input to a BTATVD
restricted master problem (RMP). The model then
assigns tanks to customers, selects delivery routes, and
determine the delivery amount to each customer on each

BTATVD Restricted Master Problem
(BTATVD-RMP)
Based on a restricted set of routes created using the route
generation approach, the restricted master problem
determines the allocation of bulk tanks to customers
while considering their time varying demand. The model,
which is described in section 3.2, also selects delivery
routes for each time period from the set of potential
routes and determines the delivery amount on each route
in each time period. The objective function value
provides an estimate for total tank allocation costs and
the net present value of the distribution costs.

recurring costs to present value using effective interest
rate. Effective annual interest rate is calculated as (1 +
ι)ξ − 1, where ι represents periodical discount rate and
ξ represents number of periods in one year. When values
recur annually, their present value is calculated as follows:

BTATVD with Recurring Demand
(BTATVD-R)
In many practical situations, demand varies within a year
but is stationary over multiple years, such that the demand
in each period of year one is equal to the demand in
corresponding periods of subsequent years. In this case,
we can solve the BTATVD model for a single year while
considering the overall time horizon. We modify the
objective function using an economic conversion factor

SOLUTION APPROACHES

The BTATVD problem can be viewed as a variant of a
multidimensional knapsack problem which belongs to
the category of NP-hard problems, along with additional
constraints. Therefore, the BTATVD problem also
belongs to the category of NP-hard problems.
Considering the budget limits for tank purchase and tank
(re-)allocations, the goal is to identify a subset of
customers, for which different tanks will contribute the
most to the distribution cost savings. Given the
complexity of the BTATVD problem, we propose the
following three solution approaches for the BTATVD
problem:
• BTATVD Restricted Master Problem (BTATVDRMP),
• BTATVD with Recurring Demand (BTATVD-R), and
• Periodically Restricting Heuristic (PRH).

Periodically Restricting Heuristic (PRH)
For many industry representative data sets, the problem
size becomes intractable for the BTATVD-RMP. Thus,
we explore a periodically restricting heuristics (PRH) to
address industry representative problem sizes. Our PRH
approach for the BTATVD problem includes the
following main phases:
• Solve bulk tank allocation period by period to
determine candidate tanks for each customer across
all time periods, and
• Determine tank allocations for varying demand over
multiple periods from the restricted set of tanks.
For the expected demand in each period, the
preferred tank size is allocated to each customer by
solving the BTA model for expected demand in that
period. Then across all periods, each customer has a set
of candidate suitable tanks. These candidate tanks are
considered when solving the tank allocation problem
across the multiple time periods. Thus, the size of the
solution space is decreased by restricting the number of
tank types that the model considers for each customer.
The overall PRH approach is illustrated in Figure 2 and
Solve bulk tank allocation with constant
demand period by period to determine
candidate tanks
The objective of phase I in our solution approach is to
develop a set of preferred candidate tanks for each
customer. In this phase, the bulk tank allocation problem
is solved for each period assuming that the monthly
demand over the time horizon is equal to the monthly
demand in that period. We adapt the decomposition
approach presented in Ellis et al. (2014) in which first a
set of high quality routes are generated. Using the output
from this modified route generation algorithm, we solve
the restricted bulk tank allocation problem to determine
the allocation of bulk tanks to customer sites for each
period while considering customer locations and demand
in relationship to other customers in the same proximity.
The resulting tank assignments for the individual
periods are used to establish a set of candidate tanks, Ti,
for each customer i.
5.3.2

Determine tank allocations for varying
demand over multiple periods
In phase II, we solve a restricted multiperiod bulk tank
allocation problem, where the model selects from one of
the tanks in set Ti for each customer i. Potential routes are
generated using the sweep algorithm assuming that each
customer’s demand is equal to their maximum demand
across all time periods to ensure sufficient routes are
available during each time period. Constraint sets (6) and
(7) are revised as follows:

Constraint set (19) assigns exactly one tank from each
customer’s set of candidate tanks to that customer, and
constraint set (20) ensures that the amount of each
delivery to customer i on route r in period q plus safety
stock requirements for that customer does not exceed the
mass capacity of the allocated tank from the set of
candidate tanks. Figure 2 summarizes the overall solution
approach.

CASE STUDY RESULTS

To evaluate the performance and scalability of the
proposed models approaches we conducted analyses
based on industrial data sets. We compare the
performance of BTATVD-RMP model with the model
with recurring demand assumption (BTATVD-R) and the
proposed PRH. In these case studies, we use industry
representative cost data, omit specific information about
customers, and omit monetary units to protect sensitive
information from our industrial partner. These data sets
range from 50 to 818 customers and the number included

in the case name indicates the number of customers in
that data set. In the test cases, the customers are assigned
to 8 different depots. We consider 21 different tank types
with capacities ranging from 1.2 m3 to 150 m3, and
refurbishment costs are assumed to range from 6,800 to
12,000. For each data set, the routes generated are the
same for each solution approach. In scenario I, we
consider a 3 year time horizon with 3 month periods (i.e.
4 periods in a year). For scenario II, we extend the length
of study time horizon to 7 years with 3 month periods.
Table 1 summarizes the parameter values of our test
cases. The data sets were analyzed on a workstation with
two Intel Xeon 3.10GHz quad-core processors, 32GB
RAM, and CPLEX v12.5.
In Table 2, we present the results obtained for
each scenario. First we use the BTATVD-RMP model,
with the original objective function (1) in which the
demand is assumed to be changing for all the periods in
the time horizon. Then we use the BTATVD-R model,
with the modified objective function (18) where we
assume that the demand is recurring. In order for the
values to be comparable, we assume that the demand for
years 2 and 3 remain the same as the first year. Finally,
we test the performance of the PRH by comparing the
results obtained from this approach to the other two
models.
For the BTATVD-RMP and BTATVD-R
approaches, we solve the model to within an optimality
gap tolerance of 2% for the set of routes generated. We
capture the lower bound at which the optimization model
stops. Then we use the maximum of the lower bounds
(obtained from BTATVD- RMP and BTATVD-R) as the
best known lower bound of the restricted models. The
best known lower bound is used to determine the gap
between the obtained solution and the lower bound as
follows:
Gap

Estimated Final Cost Lower	Bound
Lower	Bound

(21)

To provide an estimate of the resulting savings yielded by
our approaches for the company, we compare the total
costs to the distribution costs with the initial tank
allocation which we refer to as the fixed-tank approach.
With the fixed-tank approach, we solve the BTATVDRMP model but fix the initial tank allocation for each
customer to estimate the distribution costs of the initial
state.
As shown in Table 2, the recurring demand
assumption with the modified objective function results
in substantially reduced computational time for model
BTATVD-R compared to model BTATVD-RMP. The
PRH approach provides comparable objective function
values in substantially less computational time than
either BTATVD-RMP or BTATVD-R. In all cases, the

function obtained from solving the other two models and
within 3% of the best-known lower bound.
For scenario I, where the study time horizon is 3
years, the approaches yield between 4%-6% reduction in
the overall cost with annual distribution costs reduced by
9%-14% compared to the costs of initial tank allocations
(obtained from the fixed-tank approach). For scenario II,
the study time horizon is increased to 7 years. The total
cost savings are 8%-11%, with 14%-20% reduction in
transportation costs. The extended time horizon provides
a longer payback period for the initial investments for the
tank reallocation. Therefore, compared to a study horizon
of 3 years, more tank exchanges are recommended and
the total savings are more significant.
For these data sets, the PRH approach is capable
of solving larger instances within reasonable
computational time in comparison to the other two
models and enables the industrial gas production

company to consider larger clusters of their customers
while capturing their demand fluctuations. Considering
that an industrial gas production company typically has
thousands of customers around the world, these
approaches could improve their operational efficiency
and result in significant savings in their distribution
network.
For the previous results, the internal rate of
return (IRR) is used as a financial metric to provide
managerial insights on the potential benefits of a more
efficient bulk tank allocation. Table 4 summarizes the
IRR for the test cases in scenarios I and II. Using the
results from the PRH approach, the tank exchange costs
are considered as initial investments (negative cash flow)
and annual distribution savings over the fixed case are
considered as potential revenue (positive cash flow). As

SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS

In this section, we further demonstrate the benefits of the
PRH approach to gain additional managerial insights. We
also perform sensitivity analysis on periodic discount rate
(ι) and refurbishment budget (βrefurb).
To demonstrate the benefits of the capability to

address time varying demand, we compare the results
from the PRH approach with those of the BTA approach
which assumes constant demand (Ellis et al., 2014). For
this analysis, we compare the results of the current
allocation (fixed), the results of the BTA approach based
in constant demand, and the results of the PRH approach.
For the BTA approach, the average demand for each
customer is used as input and the preferred tanks are
selected. Then the resulting investment and distribution
costs of these selected tanks are evaluated using the
seasonal demand values for each customer.
As shown in Table 5, the PRH approach
outperforms both the initial state and the BTA approach.
The results clearly demonstrate the value of using the
PRH approach when customer demand varies over time.
In most cases, the BTA approach that assumes constant
demand actually outperforms the initial case. For the IA50 case, however, the BTA approach results in less
attractive tank allocations particularly with time varying
demand compared to the current tank allocations when
considering seasonality in customer demand. In general,
these results demonstrate the value of having an
from our approach to the period discount rate. Table 6
shows the results from our PRH model for the cases with
periodic discount rates of 1%, 3%, and 5%. To analyze
the results, we compare estimated total savings and
distribution savings by solving the fixed model
(assuming the current tank allocation remains
unchanged) for the same data set and calculating the
difference in total and distribution costs. As shown, the
number of tank exchanges decrease as the periodic
discount rate increases. As the periodic discount rate
increases, the present values of the distribution costs
decrease in comparison to the initial investment costs.
Thus, as expected, higher periodic discount rates result in
less justification for initial tank-related investments and
tank swaps.
We also analyze the effect of more restricting
refurbishment budgets on the results. Table 7 displays the
results from the PRH model with limited refurbishment
budgets. The refurbishment budgets are estimated based
on the number of customers. For this analysis, we base
the refurbishment budget on the number of customers
served (by multiplying the number of customers by 400).
In all scenarios, the investments in tank exchanges are
less than the original case (with a refurbishment budget
of 1,000,000), while the distribution costs increase. For

scenario ID-200, the number of the tank swaps is the
same as the original scenario, but one of the assigned tank
types is different, and the tank exchange costs are lower
and distribution costs are higher. In all scenarios, the
budgetary limit results in slightly increased distribution
costs and overall final costs.
8

SCALABILITY ANALYSIS

Using the PRH approach and the recurring demand
assumption, we are able to solve instances for up to 200
customers in less than 10 minutes within 2% of best
known lower bound. In reality,
an international
industrial gas company may have thousands of customers
around the world and therefore needs to solve larger
instances. To further improve the scalability of our
solution approach, the formulation of the mathematical
model is revised using a relaxation approach. In this
approach, we relax the integrality of the variable for
selecting routes, by changing the route selection variables,
Ψrq, from binary to continuous, limited between 0 and 1.
With this method, a route may be partially selected for
fulfilling demand, leading to distribution costs that are
potentially under-estimated. Thus solutions from this
relaxed model will have objective function values
(overall costs) less than or equal to the original models.

Because the focus of the BTATVD model is on a strategic
problem of allocating tanks, these estimates of
distribution cost may be suitable. If desired, the
distribution costs for the resulting tank allocations can be
further evaluated. For this purpose, we use the resulting
tank allocation decisions and input them to the BTATVDRMP model as given (referred to as the fixed-tank
approach).
We applied this relaxation approach to some of the
test instances from Table 2 along with two larger case. As

shown in Table 8, the relaxation approach solves the data
sets in substantially less computational time. Using the
tank allocations obtained from the relaxation method, we
solve the fixed-tank approach assuming that the allocated
tanks are given and the routes selection variables are
binary. This fixed-tank approach provides estimates of
distribution costs for the suggested tank allocation
consistent with previous results. Table 8 summarizes
fixed-tank approach results with new tank allocations for
and computational time of 50.92 minutes (from Table 2).
The relaxed model solves in approximately 0.09 minutes
as shown in Table 4. The tank allocations from the
relaxed model are then input as fixed solutions in the
BTATVD-R model with binary route selection variables
to obtain estimated final cost of 1,455,272, which is only
0.15% higher than the original BTATVD-R approach.
Thus, with the relaxed approach, we are able to solve
larger data sets in reasonable time and the resulting tank
allocation and distribution costs are similar to the
approaches that use integrated variables.

CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK

The allocation of bulk tanks to customer sites is an
important strategic level decision that has direct impact
on the operational level distribution planning for
industrial gas companies. Through this collaborative
university and industry research project, we have
developed a mixed integer programming model that
addresses the bulk tank allocation problem for time
varying demand while capturing the operational
characteristics of the actual delivery process. Given the
complexity of the problem, we develop a two phase

heuristic approach to address industry representative
problem instances. In the first phase of this approach,
the problem is solved for each period under the
assumption that customer demand is constant and equals
the demand in that period. The result of this phase is a
suggested tank size for each customer in each period and
also a set of suggested routes which are generated via a
sweep heuristic for the period with highest demand. In
phase two, the bulk tank allocation model under varying
demand is solved using CPLEX which determines a
preferred tank allocation only considering the suggested
set of tanks from phase one. This phase also selects
delivery routes and amount of gas to be delivered to each
customer on each route along with the estimated
distribution and investment costs.
The effectiveness of the solution approach was
demonstrated using industry representative data sets
provided by Air Liquide for both 3-year and 7-year time
horizons. For the data sets analyzed, several managerial
insights emerged. As the time horizon increases, more
tank changes are justified and the potential savings
increase. As the discount rate increases, less tank
exchange investments are justified. As the refurbishment
budget is reduced, fewer tank exchanges are
recommended, resulting in increased distribution costs
and overall costs.

volume. When installed at a customer site, the mass
capacity of a tank is determined based on product type
stored and pressure of the customer site. If a customer
requires three different product types, then this is
represented as three different customers in the model.
Likewise, trailer mass capacity is established by product
type. If a single physical depot distributes two different
product types, this is represented as two different depots
for the model. Thus product type is essentially a depot
attribute, and customers are assigned to depots which
provide the required product. Routes are then generated
for customers by depot. The resulting model provides an
assessment of the preferred allocation of tanks across
multiple products.
Future research will be devoted to exploring
approaches to improve the scalability of the solution
approach and quality of the obtained solutions. One
possible improvement of the algorithm could involve
using an alternative route generation method instead of
the sweep heuristic which could produce higher quality
routes depending on the geographical distribution of
customers. We also plan to assess the benefits of tank
allocations in addition to distribution cost savings by
evaluating additional key performance measures.
