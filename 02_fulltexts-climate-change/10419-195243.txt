1 Introduction
In recent years, due to the availability of data on a vast number of correlated
macroeconomic and ﬁnancial variables collected regularly by statistical agencies,
there has been an increasing interest in modeling large systems of economic time
series. Therefore, econometricians have to deal with datasets consisting of hundreds
of series, thus making the use of large dimensional dynamic factor models (DFMs)
more attractive than the usual vector autoregressive (VAR) models, which usually
limit the number of variables; see Boivin and Ng (2006). DFMs were introduced by
Geweke (1977) and Sargent and Sims (1977) with the aim of representing the
dynamics of large systems of time series through a small number of hidden common
factors, and are mainly used for one of the following two objectives: ﬁrst,
forecasting macroeconomic variables and second, estimating the underlying factor
in order to carry out policy-making (e.g., the business cycle; lagging, coincident,
and leading indicators; or impulse-response functions, among other aspects).
Another interesting application is to use the common factors as instrumental
variables or exogenous regressors in panel data analysis. See Bai and Ng (2008),
Stock and Watson (2011), and Breitung and Choi (2013) for a review of existing
literature and applications of DFMs.
Note that macroeconomic time series are generally non-stationary and frequently
cointegrated; see, for example, Kunst and Neusser (1997). On the other hand, a
cointegrated system can be expressed in terms of a factor representation; see Stock
and Watson (1988), Vahid and Engle (1993), Gonzalo and Granger (1995).
Furthermore, these authors show that the common factor representation implies that
the variables of the system are cointegrated if the common factors are I(1) and the
individual effects are I(0). However, in practice, the cointegration results are not
frequently used to predict macroeconomic variables, given that we differentiate
each element of the factor representation individually.
Empirically, it is interesting to determine the number of common factors of the
economy, given that we can summarize a large number of macroeconomic variables
in few common trends.1 Furthermore, by estimating the common factors we can
observe the orthogonal dynamics of the economy, which is very important for
macroeconomic policy. These common factors, for example, may be related to
speciﬁc groups of variables, and it is interesting to analyze mechanisms of
transmission to other groups of variables. Additionally, we can estimate the
conﬁdence intervals for the loading weights, common factors, and common
components, which allow us to carry out statistical inference in order to better
understand economic phenomena.
The stochastic common trends represent the long-run behavior of the variables.
Previous studies related to this paper are Duy and Thoma (1998), who evaluate the
1

The common factors are equivalent to the common trends when we assume a static representation in the
factor model. Barigozzi et al. (2016) develop the econometric theory for non-stationary DFMs with large
(2008), who examine the use of the factor-augmented vector autoregressive (FAVAR)
in order to predict macroeconomic and ﬁnancial variables, focusing on the US
economy. They conclude that on average, factor forecasts are slightly better than other
models. Banerjee et al. (2014) incorporate the error correction term in FAVAR
models, showing that their approach generally offers higher forecasting accuracy
relative to the FAVAR. Also, Eickmeier et al. (2014) prove different speciﬁcations of
FAVAR models, using time-varying coefﬁcients (tv) and stochastic volatility errors.
The main conclusion is that the FAVAR models, regardless of the speciﬁcation,
outperform univariate models on in-sample forecasts. When they evaluate the outsample performance, there is no improvement with respect to the benchmark model.
More recently, Hindrayanto et al. (2016) study the forecasting performance of a four
factor model approach for large datasets. They conclude that a collapsed DFM is the
most accurate model. Finally, Wilms and Croux (2016) propose a sparse cointegration
method for a large set of variables by setting some coefﬁcients in the cointegration
relationship at exactly zero. They conclude that their method leads to signiﬁcant
forecast accuracy with respect to the method proposed by Johansen (1988, 1991).
Other samples of reference are Stock and Watson (2002a, b), Marcellino et al. (2003),
˜
Pena and Poncela (2004), Reijer (2005), Schumacher (2007), Giannone et al. (2008),
Eickmeier et al. (2014), Lahiri et al. (2015), and Panopoulou and Vrontos (2015), who
show that DFMs are useful in order to reduce the forecast errors with respect to the
traditional models, as autoregressive approaches and linear regressions with
macroeconomic diffusion indexes.2 It is important to comment that, in a similar
¨
way as we have proposed in this study but in a stationary framework, Brauning and
Koopman (2014) propose to use collapsed dynamic factor analysis in order to predict
target variables of the economy, exploiting the state-space representation between the
target variables and the common factors. They conclude that the forecast accuracy is
improved with respect to benchmark models.
However, most empirical applications have been carried out for the US or Euro
economies. Therefore, we propose a FAVAR model to predict Mexican economic
activity using concepts of cointegration such that we forecast I(1) time series where
the estimated common factors are the common trends of the economy. We readily
exploit the long-run relationship between the common factors and the speciﬁc
variable that we wish to predict.3
We contribute to the literature in two ways: (1) empirically in determining the
number of common trends of the Mexican economy and (2) the use of the common
trends in order to predict economic activity. This is an advantage with respect to
2

Certainly, macroeconomic diffusion indexes are related to DFMs. However, in this study we make a
distinction between multivariate predictive approaches and the classic diffusion index forecasts given by
Stock and Watson (2002b). Furthermore, we focus on a DFM from a static point of view. Once the
common factors are estimated and their non-stationarity disentangled, we use the factors in the proposed
FAVAR representation.

A related study is Caruso (2015), who examines the ﬂow of conjunctural data relevant to assess the
state of Mexico’s economy. Speciﬁcally, the author exploits the information embedded in macroeconomic
news from both Mexico and the US, in a model constructed to nowcast Mexican real Gross Domestic
straightforward to implement computationally. Furthermore, we also direct our
attention to the predictive capacity of macroeconomic variables and their common
trends. In this way, we use the traditional method of principal components (PC) and
additionally, partial least squares (PLS).
The rest of this paper is structured as follows. In Sect. 2, we summarize the
historical behavior of the Mexican economy. In Sect. 3, we brieﬂy explain the DFM
and the FAVAR representation. In Sect. 4, we describe the estimation methods
used. In Sect. 5, we describe the data, present the cointegration results, their
descriptive predictive features, the empirical strategy to obtain small forecast errors,
and the results obtained. Finally, we conclude in Sect. 6.

2 The Mexican economy
Mexico is one of the world’s leading emerging countries. According to data from
the International Monetary Fund (IMF), it is the 11th largest economy and the
largest emerging country outside the BRICs, i.e., Brazil, Russia, India, and China
(Rodriguez-Pose and Villarreal 2015). In 2015, Mexico’s population ascended to
119.9 million and its GDP per capita stood at 9005.0 US dollars (World Bank
2016b).
After a prolonged period of sustained economic growth, the country began
decelerating in the late 1970s. Following a sovereign default, Mexico encountered a
severe economic crisis from 1982 to 1985. Subsequently, the Mexican government
put forward a series of market reforms that culminated with the implementation of
the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1994. These reforms included the
privatization of previously government-operated ﬁrms, ﬁscal reforms, and opening
the country to trade and foreign direct investment (FDI), among other actions
(Kehoe and Ruhl 2010). Mexico’s economic transformation was successful in
reducing inﬂation, maintaining ﬁscal discipline, reducing its external debt burden,
and increasing trade as a share of GDP (Hanson 2010). Nonetheless, this was not
accompanied by high levels of economic growth, as between 1982 and 2015 the
country’s GDP grew at an average annual rate of 2.3% (World Bank 2016a).
Moreover, in recent decades the Mexican economy has regressed on different
fronts. In 1995, Mexico was responsible for 7.0% of trade among economies
classiﬁed by the IMF as emerging and developing, behind China at 12.7%. By 2008,
China’s share was still the largest and totaled 22.3%, while Mexico dropped to third
at 5.4%, behind Russia. Additionally, in 1995, China was the largest recipient of
FDI to emerging and developing economies, accounting for 33.4%, while Mexico
was second, receiving 8.5%. By 2008, Mexico’s position had weakened considerably, falling to seventh at 3.2% (Kehoe and Ruhl 2010). Factors, such as rigidities
in the labor market, an inefﬁcient ﬁnancial sector, and a lack of contract
enforcement, have limited Mexico’s capacity to beneﬁt from its reforms and
therefore hindered the country’s economic growth (Kehoe and Ruhl 2010).
As an economy open to world markets, Mexico hosts many modern ﬁrms,
this represents only a small part of the economy and is concentrated in a few regions
of the country. Another segment of the economy is characterized by high levels of
informality, low-skilled work, low productivity levels, and out-of-date technologies.
Unregistered ﬁrms in the informal sector employ close to half of Mexico’s labor
force, with workers that frequently lack access to a good education, reliable health
care, and affordable ﬁnancial services, conditions that strongly hamper their
accumulation of human capital. Lastly, a third segment of the economy is made up
of companies that, for long periods, have been protected from competition,
particularly dominant ﬁrms in the energy and telecommunications sectors
(Dougherty 2015).
During the global economic crisis of 2008–2009, Mexico’s GDP suffered a
signiﬁcant contraction, which was accentuated by a reduction in the amount of
remittances the country receives from migrant workers based in the US and the
outbreak of inﬂuenza A(H1N1) throughout the country. Nevertheless, due to an
upgraded macroeconomic policy framework and careful regulation of the ﬁnancial
system, Mexico did not suffer the type of ﬁnancial and ﬁscal crises experienced in
other countries (Schwellnus 2011).
In the years following the global economic crisis, the Mexican economy was
characterized by a persistent trend of increasing debt-to-GDP, which grew from
29.0% in 2007 to 50.5% in 2016, and a signiﬁcant decline in the volume of oil
production (World Bank 2016a). Output volatility in Mexico remained high, which
can have high costs for individuals and for long-term growth. Furthermore, in
Mexico, temporary disturbances in output are usually accompanied by temporary
reductions in consumption, since a substantial share of the population is creditconstrained and the social safety net is generally weak. This is costly for individuals
who prefer a smooth path of consumption and are averse to periods of
unemployment or poverty (Schwellnus 2011).
Finally, during the last decade, Mexico has implemented a more ambitious and
wide-ranging innovation policy aimed at getting closer to the technological frontier
and generating higher levels of economic growth (Rodriguez-Pose and Villarreal
2015). By 2016, the expansion of economic activity was highly dependent on
private consumption as low levels of investment and export demand were scarcely
contributing to growth. In the medium term, economic and ﬁnancial stability and an
increase in external competitiveness, derived from the depreciation of the country’s
currency, are expected to boost private investment, exports, and hence economic
growth (World Bank 2016b).
In this context, it is very important to formulate an econometric approach in order
to successfully predict Mexican economic activity, which takes into account a large
number of macroeconomic and ﬁnancial variables associated with the behavior of
the economy. Hence, we use a large non-stationary DFM in which the variables are
summarized in the common trends of the Mexican economy. These common trends
are used in a FAVAR representation, evaluating the out-sample forecast error one
In this section we introduce notation and describe the non-stationary DFM and the
FAVAR model in order to use the common trends to predict a speciﬁc
macroeconomic variable.
3.1 Non-stationary dynamic factor model
Suppose that N large economic time series Yt ¼ ðy1t ; . . .; yNt Þ0 , observed from
t ¼ 1; . . .; T, are I(1) and any two series yit and yjt are cointegrated, such that the
idiosyncratic component et ¼ ðe1t ; . . .; eNt Þ0 is stationary. In this case, and following
Stock and Watson (1988), there is a common factor representation as follows:
Yt ¼ PFt þ et ;

ð1Þ

where P ¼ ðp01 ; . . .; p0N Þ0 is the N Â r (r\N) matrix of factor loadings, where pi ¼
ðpi1 ; . . .; pir Þ and Ft ¼ ðF1t ; . . .; Frt Þ0 is the r Â 1 vector of common factors, or in this
case, the common trends.
Given that any two series of Yt are cointegrated in the sense of Engle and Granger
(1987), the dynamic of the common factors and the idiosyncratic components are
the following:
Ft ¼ FtÀ1 þ gt

ð2Þ

et ¼ CðLÞetÀ1 þ at

ð3Þ

where the factor disturbances, gt ¼ ðg1t ; . . .; grt Þ0 , are r Â 1 vectors, distributed
independently from the idiosyncratic noises for all leads and lags. Furthermore, gt
and at are white noises with positive deﬁnite covariance matrices Rg and Ra ,
respectively. Additionally, CðLÞ collected the N Â N matrices containing the
autoregressive parameters of the idiosyncratic components where L is the lag
operator such that Lk et ¼ etÀk . These autoregressive matrices satisfy the usual stationarity assumptions.
The DFM in Eqs. (1)–(3) is not identiﬁed because for any r Â r non-singular
matrix H, the system can be expressed in terms of a new loading matrix and a new
set of common factors as follows:
Yt ¼ PÃ FtÃ þ et

ð4Þ

Ã
FtÃ ¼ FtÀ1 þ gÃ ;
t

ð5Þ

where PÃ ¼ PH, FtÃ ¼ H À1 Ft , and gÃ ¼ H À1 gt . The DFM in Eqs. (4) and (5) is
t
observationally equivalent to that in Eqs. (1) and (2). A normalization is necessary
to solve this identiﬁcation problem and uniquely deﬁne the factors. In the context of
PC factor extraction, it is common to impose the restriction P0 P=N ¼ Ir and F 0 F
being diagonal, where F ¼ ðF1 ; . . .; FT Þ0 is a T Â r matrix of common factors.
Alternatively, we can set the restrictions F 0 F=T 2 ¼ Ir and P0 P being diagonal; see
Bai and Ng (2008). On the other hand, when C 6¼ 0 and Ra is diagonal, there is
serial correlation in the idiosyncratic noises and in this case the DFM is called exact;
see Stock and Watson (2011). Chamberlain and Rothschild (1983) introduce the
term approximate model when the idiosyncratic term does not need to have a
diagonal covariance matrix. Forni et al. (2000) and Stock and Watson (2002a)
generalize the approximate model, allowing for weak serial and cross-correlation.
Furthermore, Bai and Ng (2002) and Bai (2003) also allow for heteroskedasticity in
both the time and cross-sectional dimensions.
3.2 The factor-augmented autoregressive model
Once the non-stationary DFM is speciﬁed, we can use the common trends to predict
a speciﬁc macroeconomic variable, denoted as xt ; see Stock and Watson (2005),
Banerjee et al. (2013), among many others. It is important to comment that if
forecasting is the objective, although (xt ; Ft Þ0 are integrated or cointegrated, the
FAVAR speciﬁcation is quite convenient. Note that the optimal conditional
expectation does not require stationarity or stability in the system. The theoretical
¨
justiﬁcation is given by Lutkepohl (2006). More recently, Barigozzi et al. (2016)
discuss several situations where a VAR estimated in levels is equivalent to a
cointegrated VAR. Basically, when estimating a VAR in levels we can consistently
estimate the parameters of a cointegrated VAR. Therefore, the FAVAR is provided
as follows:

summarize its long-run behavior are used to predict a speciﬁc macroeconomic
¨
variable. For a similar representation but in the stationary context, see Brauning and
Koopman (2014). Note that expression (6) is the prediction equation; for example,
assuming p ¼ 1, for any h step ahead, then
xtþh ¼ U11 xtÀðhþ1Þ þ U12 F1;tÀðhþ1Þ þ Á Á Á þ U1rþ1 Frþ1;tÀðhþ1Þ þ vtþh :

ð7Þ

The estimation of the parameters of Eq. (6) is obtained using restricted ordinary
least squares (OLS). Furthermore, it is necessary to deﬁne the number of common
factors and their factor estimates. In this section we describe some traditional
methods to determine the number of non-stationary common factors. Additionally,
we describe PC factor extraction and comment on an alternative method to estimate
the common factors, known in literature as PLS.
4.1 Determining the number of factors
It was previously assumed that r is known, however in practice it is frequently
necessary to estimate it. In this subsection we describe two procedures to determine
r in the context of large DFMs, namely the Onatski (2010) procedure and the ratio
of eigenvalues proposed by Ahn and Horenstein (2013). There are other alternatives
to determine r, the Bai and Ng (2002) information criteria, the respective correction
proposed by Alessi et al. (2010), and the procedure carried out by Kapetanios
(2010), among many other approaches. Moreover, in the context of non-stationary
DFMs, Ergemen and Rodriguez-Caballero (2016) use the procedure given by Hallin
and Liska (2007) to determine the number of regional and global factors allowing
fractional differencing in Yt . However, and following Corona et al. (2017a), they
show that the ﬁnite sample performance of the proposed procedures in this paper
exhibits a good performance when we use data in ﬁrst differences or levels and the
common factors are I(1).4
4.1.1 Onatski (2010) procedure
The Onatski (2010) procedure is based on the behavior of two adjacent eigenvalues
^
of RY ¼ T À1 Y 0 Y, for j ¼ 1; . . .; rmax . Intuitively, it is reasonable that when N and T
^
^
^ ^
tend to inﬁnity, the difference between kj À kjþ1 tends to zero while kr À krþ1
^
^
diverges to inﬁnity, where ki is the i-largest eigenvalue of RY . Onatski (2010) points
out the necessity of determining a ‘‘sharp’’ threshold that separates convergent and
divergent eigenvalues, denoted as d. The author gives the empirical procedure to
determine the threshold and in practice, this approach is more robust in presence of
non-stationarity and when the factors are weak or when the proportion of variance
attributed to the idiosyncratic components is larger than the variance of the common
^ ^
^
component. We denote this estimator as r ED ¼ maxfj rmax : kj À kjþ1 ! dg:.
4.1.2 The Ahn and Horenstein (2013) ratios of eigenvalues
Ahn and Horenstein (2013) develop the consistency of the estimation of r when they
^
use the ratio of two adjacent eigenvalues of RY under the traditional assumptions of
4

Alternatively, Bai (2004) proposes an information criteria for data in levels, modifying the PCðkÞ

chosen following the deﬁnition of Ahn and Horenstein (2013), according to which
^
^
k0 ! 0 and mk0 ! 1 as m ! 1:
4.2 Principal components factor extraction
The most popular method to extract static common factors is based on PC given that
it does not require assumptions of the error distribution, and the estimation of the
common component is consistent, among many other properties; see Bai (2003).
This procedure separates the common component from the idiosyncratic noises by
considering a cross-sectional averaging of the variables within Yt such that when
N and T tend simultaneously to inﬁnity, the weighted averages of the idiosyncratic
noises converge to zero, with only the linear combinations of the factors remaining.
Therefore, this method requires that the cumulative effects of the common
component increase proportionally with N, while the eigenvalues associated with
the idiosyncratic components remain bounded.
The PC estimator of Ft can be derived as the solution to the following least
squares problem:

subject to the restrictions F 0 F=T 2 ¼ Ir and P0 P being diagonal, where F ¼
ðF1 ; . . .; FT Þ0 is a r Â T matrix of common trends. The minimization problem in (10)
is equivalent to maximizing tr½F 0 ðYY 0 ÞF where Y ¼ ðY1 ; . . .; YT Þ0 with the dimen^
sion T Â N. This maximization problem is solved by setting F equal to T times the
eigenvectors corresponding to the r largest eigenvalues of the T Â T matrix YY 0 .
The corresponding PC estimator of P is given by5:

5

Alternatively, if we choose the restrictions P0 P=N ¼ Ir and F 0 F being diagonal, the estimator of the
pﬃﬃﬃﬃ
^
matrix of factor loadings, P, is N times the eigenvectors corresponding to the r largest eigenvalues of
^
^
the N Â N matrix Y 0 Y, with estimated factor matrix F ¼ Y P=N. The difference is only computational,
these latest restrictions are less costly when T [ N, whereas F 0 F=T 2 ¼ Ir with P0 P being diagonal are

Bai (2003) deduces that the rate of convergence and the limiting distributions of the
estimated factors, factor loadings and common component is the stationary DFM
when the cross-section and time dimensions tend towards inﬁnity. Under the
^ ^
assumptions considered in this paper, Bai (2004) shows the consistency of Ft , P; and
^t is analyzed by Bai
the common component. The ﬁnite sample performance of F
^
(2004) and recently by Corona et al. (2017b). The ﬁrst author concludes that Ft is a
close estimation of Ft when the idiosyncratic errors are stationary and even if the
sample size is moderately small (i.e., N ¼ 100 and T ¼ 40). The second authors
consider structure dependence in the idiosyncratic errors and show that when the
idiosyncratic errors are I(0) we can obtain close estimations of Ft even if N is small
^
and the variance of et is large. When the idiosyncratic errors are I(1), Ft works
poorly. In this case, it is convenient to use the estimator given by Bai and Ng
(2004).6 Other alternatives to estimate the common factors without differencing
them are given by Barigozzi et al. (2016) and Corona et al. (2017b).
Note that the estimation of Ft disregards the dynamic of Eqs. (2) and (3). The
reason for this is that we estimate the common factors from static representation in
the factor model. Corona et al. (2017b) incorporate the dynamic of Eq. (2) in a
second step to obtain smooth estimates of the common factors using the Kalman
ﬁlter. However, in this study we focus on a large DFM from static representation.
For a technical discussion of the analogies and differences between static and
dynamic representation, see for example Bai and Ng (2007). Thus, our approach is
related to Bai (2004) and Bai and Ng (2004), who study non-stationarity in DFMs
under a static representation.
4.3 Partial least squares
In addition to the estimation of Ft by PC, we consider the PLS estimation, which
takes into account the effect of a dependent variable. In a similar manner to Fuentes
et al. (2015), we estimate the common factors in economic time series using PLS,
~
denoted as F t . Intuitively, the idea is to ﬁnd the orthogonal latent variables that
maximize the covariance between Y and x ¼ ðx1 ; . . .; xT Þ0 . The estimation process is
iterative, and the ﬁrst step consists in the eigenvalue decomposition of the following
T Â T matrix:
M ¼ Yxx0 Y 0

ð12Þ

~
Then, the ﬁrst common factor, F 1t , is the ﬁrst eigenvector associated to the ﬁrst
eigenvalue of M. The second common factor is estimated from the residual matrix
~0
of e ¼ Y À BF 1 . To obtain the following common factors, the process is repeated
~
~
r À 2 steps using the F 1t ; . . .; F rÀ1t common factors in each step.

According to Bai and Ng (2004), if et is not stationary, it is necessary to differentiate Yt to consistently

In this section we present the data from the Mexican economy used in this study,
describe the methodology to evaluate the accuracy of the common trends in order to
predict the Mexican economy, determine the number of common trends, and
analyze their dynamic by evaluating the performance of the FAVAR model
proposed in Sect. 2 with respect to benchmark models.

5.1 Data
Initially, we consider 511 macroeconomic and ﬁnancial variables obtained from the
Banco de Informacion Economica (BIE) of the Insituto Nacional de Geografıa y
´
´
´
Estadıstica (INEGI), Mexico’s national statistical agency. The analysis covers from
´
March 2005 to April 2016, hence, T ¼ 133. The blocks of variables are considered
according to the INEGI division, and additionally, we compare this division with
respect to the National Institute’s Global Econometric Model, which considers nine
blocks with a total of 67 variables.7
According to our approach, it is necessary that all variables are integrated of
order one, so that, if factors are found, these are the common trends of the
observations. In this case, we consider only I(1) variables according to the
Augmented Dickey–Fuller (ADF) test.8 When needed, the time series have been
deseasonalized and corrected by outliers using X-13ARIMA-SEATS developed by
the US Census Bureau.9 Following Stock and Watson (2005), outliers are
substituted by the median of the ﬁve previous observations.
Finally, according to these non-stationary conditions, we work with the following
database of N ¼ 211 variables (number between parentheses)10:

5.2 Estimating the common trends
We apply the criteria described in this article to detect the number of factors. We
^
^
^
use an rmax ¼ 11. The results indicate that r ER ¼ r GR ¼ 2 and r ED ¼ 5.13 Given that
Onatski (2010) is more robust in the presence of non-stationarity, see Corona et al.
(2017a), we work with this number of factors.14
Figure 1 plots the results of the ratios and differences of eigenvalues with the
respective threshold. Note that, intuitively, it is congruent that the ratio of
eigenvalues of Ahn and Horenstein (2013) determines one and two common factors,
given that the ﬁrst and second differences of eigenvalues are large, while the others
are practically zero. However, the estimation of the ‘‘sharp’’ threshold is one of the
main contributions from Onatski (2010), which as we have mentioned, consistently
separates convergent and divergent eigenvalues. Furthermore, the ﬁve common
factors explain 79.19% of the total variability. Speciﬁcally, the ﬁrst common factor
explains 46.14%, the second 19.59%, the third 6.2%, the fourth 4.75%; and the ﬁfth
2.51%.
Figure 2 plots the behaviors between ln xt (deseasonalized) and each common
factor extracted by PC and PLS. We observe that the ﬁrst common factor, for each
procedure, is similar to ln xt with contemporaneous linear correlations of 0.95 for
PC and 0.96 for PLS. The second common factors are slightly correlated with ln xt ,
having contemporaneous correlations of 0.13 and 0.08 for PC and PLS, respectively.
~
~
On the other hand, F 3t and F 5t have an inverse behavior, although the correlations
with respect to ln xt are around À0:01: In the other cases, the estimated common
factors are positively related to ln xt but the linear correlations are drastically small.
These facts indicate that contemporaneously, only the ﬁrst two common factors are
associated with economic activity. It is interesting to mention that these two factors
explain 65.73% of the total variability. Note that it is complicated to establish the
predictive capacity between the common factors, and it is necessary to evaluate it in
the FAVAR model. Furthermore, it is clear that the sample period includes the
economic crisis of 2008–2009; however, Stock and Watson (2011) show that the PC
estimator of the factors is consistent even with certain types of breaks or time
variation in the factor loadings.
Figure 3 shows the weighted average contribution of each variable block in the
common factors estimated by PC. Each color bar represents the contribution of the
percentage of explanation of each variable group with respect to each common
factor, denoted as follows:

Note that the block of economic activity includes the components of the aggregate IGAE. Hence, this
speciﬁc variable is not included in the block.

Additionally, we estimate the Bai and Ng (2002) information criteria using data in levels and ﬁrst^
differenced data. In both cases, the three criteria tend to r ¼ rmax .

least relevant groups of variables. Note that this importance is in terms of the
loading contribution and it is not interpreted as predictive power. Speciﬁcally, the
ﬁrst common factor is more correlated with the IGAE of tertiary activities (0.99),

and Ng (2004), ﬁrst, we carry out a Panel Analysis of Non-stationarity in
Idiosyncratic and Common Components (PANIC) on the idiosyncratic errors
obtained using the ‘‘differencing and recumulating’’ method in order to disentangle
the non-stationarity in this component. Second, we apply a PANIC to the
idiosyncratic components estimated using data in levels as we have proposed in this
study. In the ﬁrst analysis, we obtain a p value of 0.1171 while in the second, we
^
obtain a p value of 0.0000. Although in the ﬁrst case et is statistically non-stationary,
the p value is around the uncertainty zone. Furthermore, we apply the variant of the
ADF test proposed by Bai (2004) with the aim of detecting how many of the ﬁve
common factors are non-stationary. As we expected, the tests show that the ﬁve
common factors are non-stationary. Therefore, we conclude that the idiosyncratic
terms are stationary and the common factors are non-stationary; hence, we can also
argue that the elements of Yt are cointegrated and the common factors are the
common trends of Yt and xt .
Note that Eq. (13) is the static version of Eq. (7). The goal of this exercise is to
determine whether Ft are the common trends of xt and Yt . We use this information to
forecast the target variable with the FAVAR model presented in Sect. 2.
5.3 Evaluating the use of common trends to predict Mexican economic
activity
It is important to have an empirical strategy to adequately predict the target variable.
Consequently, with the aim of selecting the forecast model, we consider all
Pr r
r
possibilities of FAVAR models,
i¼1 Ci Â 396, where Ci is the binomial
 
r
coefﬁcient
and 396 is obtained as the product of 11 seasonal dummies (3–12
i
and none), 3 deterministic speciﬁcations in the FAVAR model (none, constant and
such that we forecast 12 periods (1 year) for h ¼ 2. This forecast period is one of
relative economic and political stability in Mexico. For example, during this time
frame, the annual growth rate of Mexico’s GDP in any quarter was never lower than
2.3% and never higher than 2.8% (INEGI 2016). Moreover, the country’s economic
performance tends to be more volatile in times close to presidential elections in
Mexico, and to a lesser degree in the US, which do not coincide with our forecast
period. Statistically, this period represents around 10% of the number of
observations and discounting the degrees of freedom, we are able to represent
25% of T À K where K is the number of parameters in the FAVAR model.
For each model, we compute the forecast error. The forecasts are dynamic, so
that we update T þ 1 in each month. We selected the model that minimizes the Root
Mean Square Error (RMSE).15 Furthermore, we focus on the models that give a
forecast error lower than a threshold. This threshold is determined directly using
Eickmeier et al. (2014) as a reference. In their work they predict several
macroeconomic variables using FAVAR models, FAVAR-tv, FAVAR-tv with
stochastic volatility errors and univariate models. For one and two step ahead,
forecasting the US GDP, the RMSE values in in-sample forecasts are 0.76 and 0.80
considering all periods for h ¼ 1 and h ¼ 2; respectively. However, we select a
threshold of 0.5 to obtain more accurate forecasts. Note that, if we predict D ln xt for
the ﬁrst step ahead, the forecast error is eTþ1 ¼ ðln xTþ1 À ln xT ÞÀ
ðln xfTþ1 À ln xT Þ ¼ ln xTþ1 À ln xfTþ1 , i.e., it is equivalent to forecasting the level
of the ﬁrst step ahead. Therefore, we focus on the levels of the IGAE.
5.4 Using common trends to predict Mexican economic activity
First, in order to descriptively evaluate the predictive capacity of each variable, we
calculate the cross-correlation between yitÀh and xt and consequently:
qÃ ¼ corrðyitÀh ; xt Þjfmaxðh
h

12 : ProbðcorrðyitÀh ; xt ÞÞ\aÞg;

where a ¼ 0:05. Figure 4 plots the results of the previous equation. Note that the top
panel plots the qÃ with the conﬁdence interval. The middle panel shows their
h
corresponding maximum signiﬁcant lag, maxðh 12 : ProbðcorrðyitÀh ; xt ÞÞ\aÞ and
bottom panel presents the mean absolute correlations for each block of variables.
Note that the block of variables most highly correlated with the future of xt is the
miscellaneous one. It is interesting to note that all signiﬁcant variables of this block
are positively correlated with the IGAE. Other interesting variable blocks are the
economic activity and ﬁnancial groups. On the other hand, the blocks least correlated with the future of xt are consumer conﬁdence, employment, and prices.
15

As we have mentioned in the introduction, the goal of this paper is to forecast Mexican economic
activity. To this end, we have two measures: quarterly, GDP; and monthly, IGAE. In an early analysis, we
prove that IGAE is perfectly correlated with GDP. In this case, given the monthly frequency data, it is

common factors shows that the elements of Yt are cointegrated; hence, it is
reasonable to expect that the correlations between yit and xt are not spurious.
Once the models are estimated, we review the forecast errors lower than the
threshold in the training sample. Figure 5 plots the historical behavior of the RMSE
for the selected predictive models. The top panel plots the RMSE for h ¼ 1. Note
that the PC gives slightly more accurate results than PLS. Furthermore, the
dispersion of the RMSE for PLS is larger than PLS and neither approach presents
outliers. The bottom panel shows the results for h ¼ 2. We can see that for both
procedures, the forecast errors are slightly increased with respect to h ¼ 1. It is
interesting to mention that for both h the tails from both procedures are intercepted.
This graph is important because this behavior is expected for the following two
predicted months.
Using the models from Fig. 5 we predict two steps ahead: May and June 2016.
Note that we have n models, such that it is necessary to combine the forecasts. Thus
we propose a weighted average, obtaining loadings similar to the PLS procedure by
solving the following optimization problem:
q1 ¼ max corðX f w; xbÞ
w;b

subject to

VarðX f wÞ ¼ VarðxbÞ ¼ 1;

where w ¼ ðw1 ; . . .; wn Þ. In order to normalize the loading weights, we carry out the
P
following scaling: wÃ ¼ nð n wi ÞÀ1 w, such that the loading weights are between
i¼1
0 and 1. Figure 6 shows the forecast density, the predictions, and the observed data.
We plot the conﬁdence interval to 95%. Note that for h ¼ 1, PLS is more accurate
than PC, while for h ¼ 2, PLS is less accurate. The models are centered on the mean
of the distribution. Moreover, the forecast density acquires the observed data.
Furthermore, focusing on h ¼ 2, the distribution of PC has two modes and the
predicted data tend towards the center of the distribution. On the other hand, for
PLS, it tends towards the median of the distribution.
An interesting question is: which common trends are helpful to reduce forecast
error? To this end, we compute the following coefﬁcients through OLS:
oet jDti ¼ 1\0

and Probðoet jDti ¼ 1Þ\0:10

for i ¼ 1; . . .; Nm ;

where Nm is the number of models for each procedure. In other words, we carry out
a linear regression between the forecast errors according to each procedure and
dummy variables that specify the combination of common trends F1t , F2t , F3t , F4t ;
and F5t for both procedures. Figure 7 plots the result for each procedure in each h.
We can see that, in PC, F1t is a very important common factor to reduce the forecast
error for h ¼ 1, whereas F1t , F2t , F4t ; and F5t are important for h ¼ 2. Furthermore,
in the PLS approach F1t , F2t , F4t ; and F5t are relevant common factors for h ¼ 1
whereas F1t ; and F2t are for h ¼ 2. In fact, for both procedures the interaction of all
common factors is important to reduce the forecast errors. This result completes the
conclusions when we analyze Figs. 1 and 4, where all common factors are helpful to
reduce the forecast errors.
In order to evaluate the forecast accuracy in ‘‘real time,’’ we predict two steps ahead

forecast error for May 2016. For h ¼ 1, PC gives a forecast error of 0.1 in June 2016. In
conclusion, and with reference to Fig. 5, the results are as expected given that PC and
PLS give forecast errors lower than the selected threshold.
It is interesting to mention the historical behavior of the models. Hence, we ﬁrst
analyze the RMSE of the benchmark models: the Autoregressive Integrated Moving

slightly reduced in both cases; however, the macroeconomic diffusion index has better
results. Hence, note that the inclusion of the factor in linear models reduces the forecast
error. Then, we would expect the FAVAR models to show a small RMSE.16

Alternatively, we can consider RMSE in terms of benchmark models like several authors. However,

considering the approach presented in this work. Note that the RMSE interval of
PC for h ¼ 1 is between 0.27 and 0.67 and for h ¼ 2 between 0.29 and 0.59. The
RMSE mean values are 0.47 and 0.44 for each h, respectively. Note that in both h,
February 2016 is the outlier forecast error. On the other hand, for PLS and h ¼ 1,
the forecast errors are between 0.34 and 0.60 and for h ¼ 2, the conﬁdence interval
is between 0.3 and 0.64. In this case, the mean of RMSE is 0.47 for each h,
respectively. Note that the improvement with respect to the ARIMA model and
macroeconomic diffusion index is relevant, above all when the factors are estimated
using PC. Note that the forecast errors are very similar between PC and PLS.
A question of interest is: are the models consistent through the training sample?
We can obtain different models in each step ahead, in which case the consistency of
the predictors may be questionable. Taking into account only the selected models,
we can observe in Fig. 11 that all models are robust in h ¼ 1. In fact, 76% of the
models are within the threshold and for h ¼ 2, the behavior of the predictions is
similar to May 2016. Note that the predictions for May and June 2016 are carried
out with information up to April 2016. Hence, we present the forecast in h ¼ 1 for
May 2016 and h ¼ 2 for June 2016. The model is not updated as in the previous
forecasts. It is interesting to note that February 2016 was the most complicated
month to predict; however, the robustness of the selected models is reasonable. The
reason why February 2016 was a complicated month to predict can be explained by
the fact that this month has 29 days, and the seasonal variables and the dynamics
between the variables do not account for this effect.

6 Conclusions and further research
In this paper we estimated the common trends of the Mexican economy using a large
dataset of macroeconomic variables. Using cointegration concepts, we estimated the
common trends using I(1) variables through PC, determining the number of common
factors according to the Onatski (2010) and the Ahn and Horenstein (2013)
procedures. Alternatively, we estimated the common factors using PLS.
We ﬁnd that 211 macroeconomic and ﬁnancial variables can be summarized in at
^
most r ¼ 5 common trends, which are cointegrated with Mexican economic
activity. Furthermore, we use the common trends in a FAVAR model with the aim
of predicting Mexican economic activity. We statistically evaluate the predictive
capacity of the common trends, where we can see that each common factor reduces
the forecast error. Additionally, we observe that the forecast error is reduced with
respect to the ARIMA and factor-augmented regressions, such that the common
trends are useful to predict Mexican economic activity.
An important conclusion is that the macroeconomic common trends can be used
in more sophisticated models in order to reduce the forecast errors. Additionally,
note that in this study we used data in levels in order to estimate the common
factors. This is empirical evidence on the use of DFMs when we do not transform

Economically, the more relevant groups of variables in the determination of the
common trends are the miscellaneous group, the economic activity, balance of
trade, and the industrial sector. The ﬁrst group of variables basically comprises
tourism information and variables related to the automotive industry. In this context,
the behaviors of the external sector and internal demand are very important to
predict the behavior of the global economy. It is reasonable to expect that external
uncertainty and disincentives in the internal market can be dangerous for future
economic growth. In other words, these groups of variables indicate the future
movements of Mexican economic activity.
A future line of research is to use the common trends in factor error correction
models (FECM), and FAVAR with time-varying coefﬁcients, among many other
models, combining the predictions with different combinations of forecasting
methods. Furthermore, we consider a unit root test that takes into account the
structural break that occurred between 2008 and 2009 in order to reﬁne the procedure
to select I(1) variables. Consequently, it is interesting to study the non-stationarity of
the estimated common factors in the presence of breaks. Additionally, we will take into
account the possibility of sparse cointegration for forecasting proposes.

Abstract In this paper we propose to use the common trends of the Mexican
economy in order to predict economic activity one and two steps ahead. We exploit
the cointegration properties of the macroeconomic time series, such that, when the
series are I(1) and cointegrated, there is a factor representation, where the common
factors are the common trends of the macroeconomic variables. Thus, we estimate a
large non-stationary dynamic factor model using principal components (PC) as
suggested by Bai (J Econom 122(1):137–183, 2004), where the estimated common
factors are used in a factor-augmented vector autoregressive model to forecast the
Global Index of Economic Activity. Additionally, we estimate the common trends
through partial least squares. The results indicate that the common trends are useful
to predict Mexican economic activity, and reduce the forecast error with respect to
benchmark models, mainly when estimated using PC.

1 Introduction
In recent years, due to the availability of data on a vast number of correlated
macroeconomic and ﬁnancial variables collected regularly by statistical agencies,
there has been an increasing interest in modeling large systems of economic time
series. Therefore, econometricians have to deal with datasets consisting of hundreds
of series, thus making the use of large dimensional dynamic factor models (DFMs)
more attractive than the usual vector autoregressive (VAR) models, which usually
limit the number of variables; see Boivin and Ng (2006). DFMs were introduced by
Geweke (1977) and Sargent and Sims (1977) with the aim of representing the
dynamics of large systems of time series through a small number of hidden common
factors, and are mainly used for one of the following two objectives: ﬁrst,
forecasting macroeconomic variables and second, estimating the underlying factor
in order to carry out policy-making (e.g., the business cycle; lagging, coincident,
and leading indicators; or impulse-response functions, among other aspects).
Another interesting application is to use the common factors as instrumental
variables or exogenous regressors in panel data analysis. See Bai and Ng (2008),
Stock and Watson (2011), and Breitung and Choi (2013) for a review of existing
literature and applications of DFMs.
Note that macroeconomic time series are generally non-stationary and frequently
cointegrated; see, for example, Kunst and Neusser (1997). On the other hand, a
cointegrated system can be expressed in terms of a factor representation; see Stock
and Watson (1988), Vahid and Engle (1993), Gonzalo and Granger (1995).
Furthermore, these authors show that the common factor representation implies that
the variables of the system are cointegrated if the common factors are I(1) and the
individual effects are I(0). However, in practice, the cointegration results are not
frequently used to predict macroeconomic variables, given that we differentiate
each element of the factor representation individually.
Empirically, it is interesting to determine the number of common factors of the
economy, given that we can summarize a large number of macroeconomic variables
in few common trends.1 Furthermore, by estimating the common factors we can
observe the orthogonal dynamics of the economy, which is very important for
macroeconomic policy. These common factors, for example, may be related to
speciﬁc groups of variables, and it is interesting to analyze mechanisms of
transmission to other groups of variables. Additionally, we can estimate the
conﬁdence intervals for the loading weights, common factors, and common
components, which allow us to carry out statistical inference in order to better
understand economic phenomena.
The stochastic common trends represent the long-run behavior of the variables.
Previous studies related to this paper are Duy and Thoma (1998), who evaluate the
1

The common factors are equivalent to the common trends when we assume a static representation in the
factor model. Barigozzi et al. (2016) develop the econometric theory for non-stationary DFMs with large
(2008), who examine the use of the factor-augmented vector autoregressive (FAVAR)
in order to predict macroeconomic and ﬁnancial variables, focusing on the US
economy. They conclude that on average, factor forecasts are slightly better than other
models. Banerjee et al. (2014) incorporate the error correction term in FAVAR
models, showing that their approach generally offers higher forecasting accuracy
relative to the FAVAR. Also, Eickmeier et al. (2014) prove different speciﬁcations of
FAVAR models, using time-varying coefﬁcients (tv) and stochastic volatility errors.
The main conclusion is that the FAVAR models, regardless of the speciﬁcation,
outperform univariate models on in-sample forecasts. When they evaluate the outsample performance, there is no improvement with respect to the benchmark model.
More recently, Hindrayanto et al. (2016) study the forecasting performance of a four
factor model approach for large datasets. They conclude that a collapsed DFM is the
most accurate model. Finally, Wilms and Croux (2016) propose a sparse cointegration
method for a large set of variables by setting some coefﬁcients in the cointegration
relationship at exactly zero. They conclude that their method leads to signiﬁcant
forecast accuracy with respect to the method proposed by Johansen (1988, 1991).
Other samples of reference are Stock and Watson (2002a, b), Marcellino et al. (2003),
˜
Pena and Poncela (2004), Reijer (2005), Schumacher (2007), Giannone et al. (2008),
Eickmeier et al. (2014), Lahiri et al. (2015), and Panopoulou and Vrontos (2015), who
show that DFMs are useful in order to reduce the forecast errors with respect to the
traditional models, as autoregressive approaches and linear regressions with
macroeconomic diffusion indexes.2 It is important to comment that, in a similar
¨
way as we have proposed in this study but in a stationary framework, Brauning and
Koopman (2014) propose to use collapsed dynamic factor analysis in order to predict
target variables of the economy, exploiting the state-space representation between the
target variables and the common factors. They conclude that the forecast accuracy is
improved with respect to benchmark models.
However, most empirical applications have been carried out for the US or Euro
economies. Therefore, we propose a FAVAR model to predict Mexican economic
activity using concepts of cointegration such that we forecast I(1) time series where
the estimated common factors are the common trends of the economy. We readily
exploit the long-run relationship between the common factors and the speciﬁc
variable that we wish to predict.3
We contribute to the literature in two ways: (1) empirically in determining the
number of common trends of the Mexican economy and (2) the use of the common
trends in order to predict economic activity. This is an advantage with respect to
2

Certainly, macroeconomic diffusion indexes are related to DFMs. However, in this study we make a
distinction between multivariate predictive approaches and the classic diffusion index forecasts given by
Stock and Watson (2002b). Furthermore, we focus on a DFM from a static point of view. Once the
common factors are estimated and their non-stationarity disentangled, we use the factors in the proposed
FAVAR representation.

3

A related study is Caruso (2015), who examines the ﬂow of conjunctural data relevant to assess the
state of Mexico’s economy. Speciﬁcally, the author exploits the information embedded in macroeconomic
news from both Mexico and the US, in a model constructed to nowcast Mexican real Gross Domestic
straightforward to implement computationally. Furthermore, we also direct our
attention to the predictive capacity of macroeconomic variables and their common
trends. In this way, we use the traditional method of principal components (PC) and
additionally, partial least squares (PLS).
The rest of this paper is structured as follows. In Sect. 2, we summarize the
historical behavior of the Mexican economy. In Sect. 3, we brieﬂy explain the DFM
and the FAVAR representation. In Sect. 4, we describe the estimation methods
used. In Sect. 5, we describe the data, present the cointegration results, their
descriptive predictive features, the empirical strategy to obtain small forecast errors,
and the results obtained. Finally, we conclude in Sect. 6.

2 The Mexican economy
Mexico is one of the world’s leading emerging countries. According to data from
the International Monetary Fund (IMF), it is the 11th largest economy and the
largest emerging country outside the BRICs, i.e., Brazil, Russia, India, and China
(Rodriguez-Pose and Villarreal 2015). In 2015, Mexico’s population ascended to
119.9 million and its GDP per capita stood at 9005.0 US dollars (World Bank
2016b).
After a prolonged period of sustained economic growth, the country began
decelerating in the late 1970s. Following a sovereign default, Mexico encountered a
severe economic crisis from 1982 to 1985. Subsequently, the Mexican government
put forward a series of market reforms that culminated with the implementation of
the North American Free Trade Agreement in 1994. These reforms included the
privatization of previously government-operated ﬁrms, ﬁscal reforms, and opening
the country to trade and foreign direct investment (FDI), among other actions
(Kehoe and Ruhl 2010). Mexico’s economic transformation was successful in
reducing inﬂation, maintaining ﬁscal discipline, reducing its external debt burden,
and increasing trade as a share of GDP (Hanson 2010). Nonetheless, this was not
accompanied by high levels of economic growth, as between 1982 and 2015 the
country’s GDP grew at an average annual rate of 2.3% (World Bank 2016a).
Moreover, in recent decades the Mexican economy has regressed on different
fronts. In 1995, Mexico was responsible for 7.0% of trade among economies
classiﬁed by the IMF as emerging and developing, behind China at 12.7%. By 2008,
China’s share was still the largest and totaled 22.3%, while Mexico dropped to third
at 5.4%, behind Russia. Additionally, in 1995, China was the largest recipient of
FDI to emerging and developing economies, accounting for 33.4%, while Mexico
was second, receiving 8.5%. By 2008, Mexico’s position had weakened considerably, falling to seventh at 3.2% (Kehoe and Ruhl 2010). Factors, such as rigidities
in the labor market, an inefﬁcient ﬁnancial sector, and a lack of contract
enforcement, have limited Mexico’s capacity to beneﬁt from its reforms and
therefore hindered the country’s economic growth (Kehoe and Ruhl 2010).
As an economy open to world markets, Mexico hosts many modern ﬁrms,
this represents only a small part of the economy and is concentrated in a few regions
of the country. Another segment of the economy is characterized by high levels of
informality, low-skilled work, low productivity levels, and out-of-date technologies.
Unregistered ﬁrms in the informal sector employ close to half of Mexico’s labor
force, with workers that frequently lack access to a good education, reliable health
care, and affordable ﬁnancial services, conditions that strongly hamper their
accumulation of human capital. Lastly, a third segment of the economy is made up
of companies that, for long periods, have been protected from competition,
particularly dominant ﬁrms in the energy and telecommunications sectors
(Dougherty 2015).
During the global economic crisis of 2008–2009, Mexico’s GDP suffered a
signiﬁcant contraction, which was accentuated by a reduction in the amount of
remittances the country receives from migrant workers based in the US and the
outbreak of inﬂuenza A(H1N1) throughout the country. Nevertheless, due to an
upgraded macroeconomic policy framework and careful regulation of the ﬁnancial
system, Mexico did not suffer the type of ﬁnancial and ﬁscal crises experienced in
other countries (Schwellnus 2011).
In the years following the global economic crisis, the Mexican economy was
characterized by a persistent trend of increasing debt-to-GDP, which grew from
29.0% in 2007 to 50.5% in 2016, and a signiﬁcant decline in the volume of oil
production (World Bank 2016a). Output volatility in Mexico remained high, which
can have high costs for individuals and for long-term growth. Furthermore, in
Mexico, temporary disturbances in output are usually accompanied by temporary
reductions in consumption, since a substantial share of the population is creditconstrained and the social safety net is generally weak. This is costly for individuals
who prefer a smooth path of consumption and are averse to periods of
unemployment or poverty (Schwellnus 2011).
Finally, during the last decade, Mexico has implemented a more ambitious and
wide-ranging innovation policy aimed at getting closer to the technological frontier
and generating higher levels of economic growth (Rodriguez-Pose and Villarreal
2015). By 2016, the expansion of economic activity was highly dependent on
private consumption as low levels of investment and export demand were scarcely
contributing to growth. In the medium term, economic and ﬁnancial stability and an
increase in external competitiveness, derived from the depreciation of the country’s
currency, are expected to boost private investment, exports, and hence economic
growth (World Bank 2016b).
In this context, it is very important to formulate an econometric approach in order
to successfully predict Mexican economic activity, which takes into account a large
number of macroeconomic and ﬁnancial variables associated with the behavior of
the economy. Hence, we use a large non-stationary DFM in which the variables are
summarized in the common trends of the Mexican economy. These common trends
are used in a FAVAR representation, evaluating the out-sample forecast error one
In this section we introduce notation and describe the non-stationary DFM and the
FAVAR model in order to use the common trends to predict a speciﬁc
macroeconomic variable.
3.1 Non-stationary dynamic factor model
Suppose that N large economic time series Yt ¼ ðy1t ; . . .; yNt Þ0 , observed from
t ¼ 1; . . .; T, are I(1) and any two series yit and yjt are cointegrated, such that the
idiosyncratic component et ¼ ðe1t ; . . .; eNt Þ0 is stationary. In this case, and following
Stock and Watson (1988), there is a common factor representation as follows:
Yt ¼ PFt þ et ;

ð1Þ

where P ¼ ðp01 ; . . .; p0N Þ0 is the N Â r (r\N) matrix of factor loadings, where pi ¼
ðpi1 ; . . .; pir Þ and Ft ¼ ðF1t ; . . .; Frt Þ0 is the r Â 1 vector of common factors, or in this
case, the common trends.
Given that any two series of Yt are cointegrated in the sense of Engle and Granger
(1987), the dynamic of the common factors and the idiosyncratic components are
the following:
Ft ¼ FtÀ1 þ gt

ð2Þ

et ¼ CðLÞetÀ1 þ at

ð3Þ

where the factor disturbances, gt ¼ ðg1t ; . . .; grt Þ0 , are r Â 1 vectors, distributed
independently from the idiosyncratic noises for all leads and lags. Furthermore, gt
and at are white noises with positive deﬁnite covariance matrices Rg and Ra ,
respectively. Additionally, CðLÞ collected the N Â N matrices containing the
autoregressive parameters of the idiosyncratic components where L is the lag
operator such that Lk et ¼ etÀk . These autoregressive matrices satisfy the usual stationarity assumptions.
The DFM in Eqs. (1)–(3) is not identiﬁed because for any r Â r non-singular
matrix H, the system can be expressed in terms of a new loading matrix and a new
set of common factors as follows:
Yt ¼ PÃ FtÃ þ et

ð4Þ

Ã
FtÃ ¼ FtÀ1 þ gÃ ;
t

ð5Þ

where PÃ ¼ PH, FtÃ ¼ H À1 Ft , and gÃ ¼ H À1 gt . The DFM in Eqs. (4) and (5) is
t
observationally equivalent to that in Eqs. (1) and (2). A normalization is necessary
to solve this identiﬁcation problem and uniquely deﬁne the factors. In the context of
PC factor extraction, it is common to impose the restriction P0 P=N ¼ Ir and F 0 F
being diagonal, where F ¼ ðF1 ; . . .; FT Þ0 is a T Â r matrix of common factors.
Alternatively, we can set the restrictions F 0 F=T 2 ¼ Ir and P0 P being diagonal; see
Bai and Ng (2008). On the other hand, when C 6¼ 0 and Ra is diagonal, there is
serial correlation in the idiosyncratic noises and in this case the DFM is called exact;
see Stock and Watson (2011). Chamberlain and Rothschild (1983) introduce the
term approximate model when the idiosyncratic term does not need to have a
diagonal covariance matrix. Forni et al. (2000) and Stock and Watson (2002a)
generalize the approximate model, allowing for weak serial and cross-correlation.
Furthermore, Bai and Ng (2002) and Bai (2003) also allow for heteroskedasticity in
both the time and cross-sectional dimensions.
3.2 The factor-augmented autoregressive model
Once the non-stationary DFM is speciﬁed, we can use the common trends to predict
a speciﬁc macroeconomic variable, denoted as xt ; see Stock and Watson (2005),
Banerjee et al. (2013), among many others. It is important to comment that if
forecasting is the objective, although (xt ; Ft Þ0 are integrated or cointegrated, the
FAVAR speciﬁcation is quite convenient. Note that the optimal conditional
expectation does not require stationarity or stability in the system. The theoretical
¨
justiﬁcation is given by Lutkepohl (2006). More recently, Barigozzi et al. (2016)
discuss several situations where a VAR estimated in levels is equivalent to a
cointegrated VAR. Basically, when estimating a VAR in levels we can consistently
estimate the parameters of a cointegrated VAR. Therefore, the FAVAR is provided

Koopman (2014). Note that expression (6) is the prediction equation; for example,

The estimation of the parameters of Eq. (6) is obtained using restricted ordinary
least squares (OLS). Furthermore, it is necessary to deﬁne the number of common
factors and their factor estimates. In this section we describe some traditional
methods to determine the number of non-stationary common factors. Additionally,
we describe PC factor extraction and comment on an alternative method to estimate
the common factors, known in literature as PLS.
4.1 Determining the number of factors
It was previously assumed that r is known, however in practice it is frequently
necessary to estimate it. In this subsection we describe two procedures to determine
r in the context of large DFMs, namely the Onatski (2010) procedure and the ratio
of eigenvalues proposed by Ahn and Horenstein (2013). There are other alternatives
to determine r, the Bai and Ng (2002) information criteria, the respective correction
proposed by Alessi et al. (2010), and the procedure carried out by Kapetanios
(2010), among many other approaches. Moreover, in the context of non-stationary
DFMs, Ergemen and Rodriguez-Caballero (2016) use the procedure given by Hallin
and Liska (2007) to determine the number of regional and global factors allowing
fractional differencing in Yt . However, and following Corona et al. (2017a), they
show that the ﬁnite sample performance of the proposed procedures in this paper
exhibits a good performance when we use data in ﬁrst differences or levels and the
common factors are I(1).4
4.1.1 Onatski (2010) procedure
The Onatski (2010) procedure is based on the behavior of two adjacent eigenvalues
^
of RY ¼ T À1 Y 0 Y, for j ¼ 1; . . .; rmax . Intuitively, it is reasonable that when N and T
^
^
^ ^
tend to inﬁnity, the difference between kj À kjþ1 tends to zero while kr À krþ1
^
^
diverges to inﬁnity, where ki is the i-largest eigenvalue of RY . Onatski (2010) points
out the necessity of determining a ‘‘sharp’’ threshold that separates convergent and
divergent eigenvalues, denoted as d. The author gives the empirical procedure to
determine the threshold and in practice, this approach is more robust in presence of
non-stationarity and when the factors are weak or when the proportion of variance
attributed to the idiosyncratic components is larger than the variance of the common
^ ^
^
component. We denote this estimator as r ED ¼ maxfj rmax : kj À kjþ1 ! dg:.
4.1.2 The Ahn and Horenstein (2013) ratios of eigenvalues
Ahn and Horenstein (2013) develop the consistency of the estimation of r when they
^
use the ratio of two adjacent eigenvalues of RY under the traditional assumptions of
4

Alternatively, Bai (2004) proposes an information criteria for data in levels, modifying the PCðkÞ

chosen following the deﬁnition of Ahn and Horenstein (2013), according to which
^
^
k0 ! 0 and mk0 ! 1 as m ! 1:
4.2 Principal components factor extraction
The most popular method to extract static common factors is based on PC given that
it does not require assumptions of the error distribution, and the estimation of the
common component is consistent, among many other properties; see Bai (2003).
This procedure separates the common component from the idiosyncratic noises by
considering a cross-sectional averaging of the variables within Yt such that when
N and T tend simultaneously to inﬁnity, the weighted averages of the idiosyncratic
noises converge to zero, with only the linear combinations of the factors remaining.
Therefore, this method requires that the cumulative effects of the common
component increase proportionally with N, while the eigenvalues associated with
the idiosyncratic components remain bounded.
The PC estimator of Ft can be derived as the solution to the following least
squares problem:
Vr ðP; FÞ ¼

subject to the restrictions F 0 F=T 2 ¼ Ir and P0 P being diagonal, where F ¼
ðF1 ; . . .; FT Þ0 is a r Â T matrix of common trends. The minimization problem in (10)
is equivalent to maximizing tr½F 0 ðYY 0 ÞF where Y ¼ ðY1 ; . . .; YT Þ0 with the dimen^
sion T Â N. This maximization problem is solved by setting F equal to T times the
eigenvectors corresponding to the r largest eigenvalues of the T Â T matrix YY 0 .
The corresponding PC estimator of P is given by5:

5

Alternatively, if we choose the restrictions P0 P=N ¼ Ir and F 0 F being diagonal, the estimator of the
pﬃﬃﬃﬃ
^
matrix of factor loadings, P, is N times the eigenvectors corresponding to the r largest eigenvalues of
^
^
the N Â N matrix Y 0 Y, with estimated factor matrix F ¼ Y P=N. The difference is only computational,
these latest restrictions are less costly when T [ N, whereas F 0 F=T 2 ¼ Ir with P0 P being diagonal are
P¼ 2 :

ð11Þ

Bai (2003) deduces that the rate of convergence and the limiting distributions of the
estimated factors, factor loadings and common component is the stationary DFM
when the cross-section and time dimensions tend towards inﬁnity. Under the
^ ^
assumptions considered in this paper, Bai (2004) shows the consistency of Ft , P; and
^t is analyzed by Bai
the common component. The ﬁnite sample performance of F
^
(2004) and recently by Corona et al. (2017b). The ﬁrst author concludes that Ft is a
close estimation of Ft when the idiosyncratic errors are stationary and even if the
sample size is moderately small (i.e., N ¼ 100 and T ¼ 40). The second authors
consider structure dependence in the idiosyncratic errors and show that when the
idiosyncratic errors are I(0) we can obtain close estimations of Ft even if N is small
^
and the variance of et is large. When the idiosyncratic errors are I(1), Ft works
poorly. In this case, it is convenient to use the estimator given by Bai and Ng
(2004).6 Other alternatives to estimate the common factors without differencing
them are given by Barigozzi et al. (2016) and Corona et al. (2017b).
Note that the estimation of Ft disregards the dynamic of Eqs. (2) and (3). The
reason for this is that we estimate the common factors from static representation in
the factor model. Corona et al. (2017b) incorporate the dynamic of Eq. (2) in a
second step to obtain smooth estimates of the common factors using the Kalman
ﬁlter. However, in this study we focus on a large DFM from static representation.
For a technical discussion of the analogies and differences between static and
dynamic representation, see for example Bai and Ng (2007). Thus, our approach is
related to Bai (2004) and Bai and Ng (2004), who study non-stationarity in DFMs
under a static representation.
4.3 Partial least squares
In addition to the estimation of Ft by PC, we consider the PLS estimation, which
takes into account the effect of a dependent variable. In a similar manner to Fuentes
et al. (2015), we estimate the common factors in economic time series using PLS,
~
denoted as F t . Intuitively, the idea is to ﬁnd the orthogonal latent variables that
maximize the covariance between Y and x ¼ ðx1 ; . . .; xT Þ0 . The estimation process is
iterative, and the ﬁrst step consists in the eigenvalue decomposition of the following
T Â T matrix:
M ¼ Yxx0 Y 0

ð12Þ

~
Then, the ﬁrst common factor, F 1t , is the ﬁrst eigenvector associated to the ﬁrst
eigenvalue of M. The second common factor is estimated from the residual matrix
~0
of e ¼ Y À BF 1 . To obtain the following common factors, the process is repeated
~
~
r À 2 steps using the F 1t ; . . .; F rÀ1t common factors in each step.
6
According to Bai and Ng (2004), if et is not stationary, it is necessary to differentiate Yt to consistently

In this section we present the data from the Mexican economy used in this study,
describe the methodology to evaluate the accuracy of the common trends in order to
predict the Mexican economy, determine the number of common trends, and
analyze their dynamic by evaluating the performance of the FAVAR model
proposed in Sect. 2 with respect to benchmark models.

5.1 Data
Initially, we consider 511 macroeconomic and ﬁnancial variables obtained from the
Banco de Informacion Economica (BIE) of the Insituto Nacional de Geografıa y
´
´
´
Estadıstica (INEGI), Mexico’s national statistical agency. The analysis covers from
´
March 2005 to April 2016, hence, T ¼ 133. The blocks of variables are considered
according to the INEGI division, and additionally, we compare this division with
respect to the National Institute’s Global Econometric Model, which considers nine
blocks with a total of 67 variables.7
According to our approach, it is necessary that all variables are integrated of
order one, so that, if factors are found, these are the common trends of the
observations. In this case, we consider only I(1) variables according to the
Augmented Dickey–Fuller (ADF) test.8 When needed, the time series have been
deseasonalized and corrected by outliers using X-13ARIMA-SEATS developed by
the US Census Bureau.9 Following Stock and Watson (2005), outliers are
substituted by the median of the ﬁve previous observations.
Finally, according to these non-stationary conditions, we work with the following
database of N ¼ 211 variables (number between parentheses)10:

5.2 Estimating the common trends
We apply the criteria described in this article to detect the number of factors. We
^
^
^
use an rmax ¼ 11. The results indicate that r ER ¼ r GR ¼ 2 and r ED ¼ 5.13 Given that
Onatski (2010) is more robust in the presence of non-stationarity, see Corona et al.
(2017a), we work with this number of factors.14
Figure 1 plots the results of the ratios and differences of eigenvalues with the
respective threshold. Note that, intuitively, it is congruent that the ratio of
eigenvalues of Ahn and Horenstein (2013) determines one and two common factors,
given that the ﬁrst and second differences of eigenvalues are large, while the others
are practically zero. However, the estimation of the ‘‘sharp’’ threshold is one of the
main contributions from Onatski (2010), which as we have mentioned, consistently
separates convergent and divergent eigenvalues. Furthermore, the ﬁve common
factors explain 79.19% of the total variability. Speciﬁcally, the ﬁrst common factor
explains 46.14%, the second 19.59%, the third 6.2%, the fourth 4.75%; and the ﬁfth
2.51%.
Figure 2 plots the behaviors between ln xt (deseasonalized) and each common
factor extracted by PC and PLS. We observe that the ﬁrst common factor, for each
procedure, is similar to ln xt with contemporaneous linear correlations of 0.95 for
PC and 0.96 for PLS. The second common factors are slightly correlated with ln xt ,
having contemporaneous correlations of 0.13 and 0.08 for PC and PLS, respectively.
~
~
On the other hand, F 3t and F 5t have an inverse behavior, although the correlations
with respect to ln xt are around À0:01: In the other cases, the estimated common
factors are positively related to ln xt but the linear correlations are drastically small.
These facts indicate that contemporaneously, only the ﬁrst two common factors are
associated with economic activity. It is interesting to mention that these two factors
explain 65.73% of the total variability. Note that it is complicated to establish the
predictive capacity between the common factors, and it is necessary to evaluate it in
the FAVAR model. Furthermore, it is clear that the sample period includes the
economic crisis of 2008–2009; however, Stock and Watson (2011) show that the PC
estimator of the factors is consistent even with certain types of breaks or time
variation in the factor loadings.
Figure 3 shows the weighted average contribution of each variable block in the
common factors estimated by PC. Each color bar represents the contribution of the
percentage of explanation of each variable group with respect to each common
factor, denoted as follows:
12

Note that the block of economic activity includes the components of the aggregate IGAE. Hence, this
speciﬁc variable is not included in the block.
13
Additionally, we estimate the Bai and Ng (2002) information criteria using data in levels and ﬁrst^
differenced data. In both cases, the three criteria tend to r ¼ rmax .

For the US economy, Alessi et al. (2010) determine six common factors using the database from Stock

variance contribution of each common factor. The block that most explains the
common factors is the miscellaneous group, economic activity, and balance of trade
blocks. On the other hand, prices, employment, and consumer conﬁdence are the
least relevant groups of variables. Note that this importance is in terms of the
loading contribution and it is not interpreted as predictive power. Speciﬁcally, the
ﬁrst common factor is more correlated with the IGAE of tertiary activities (0.99),
the second common factor with the economic situation with respect to last year
(0.94), the third common factor with oil exports (0.78), the fourth common factor
with ediﬁcation (0.70), and the ﬁfth common factor with the food industry (0.53).
In order to evaluate if the common factors are the common trends of xt , we carry
out the cointegration exercise. The possible cointegration relationship is given by:

and Ng (2004), ﬁrst, we carry out a Panel Analysis of Non-stationarity in
Idiosyncratic and Common Components (PANIC) on the idiosyncratic errors
obtained using the ‘‘differencing and recumulating’’ method in order to disentangle
the non-stationarity in this component. Second, we apply a PANIC to the
idiosyncratic components estimated using data in levels as we have proposed in this
study. In the ﬁrst analysis, we obtain a p value of 0.1171 while in the second, we
^
obtain a p value of 0.0000. Although in the ﬁrst case et is statistically non-stationary,
the p value is around the uncertainty zone. Furthermore, we apply the variant of the
ADF test proposed by Bai (2004) with the aim of detecting how many of the ﬁve
common factors are non-stationary. As we expected, the tests show that the ﬁve
common factors are non-stationary. Therefore, we conclude that the idiosyncratic
terms are stationary and the common factors are non-stationary; hence, we can also
argue that the elements of Yt are cointegrated and the common factors are the
common trends of Yt and xt .
Note that Eq. (13) is the static version of Eq. (7). The goal of this exercise is to
determine whether Ft are the common trends of xt and Yt . We use this information to
forecast the target variable with the FAVAR model presented in Sect. 2.
5.3 Evaluating the use of common trends to predict Mexican economic
activity
It is important to have an empirical strategy to adequately predict the target variable.
Consequently, with the aim of selecting the forecast model, we consider all
Pr r
r
possibilities of FAVAR models,
i¼1 Ci Â 396, where Ci is the binomial
 
r
coefﬁcient
and 396 is obtained as the product of 11 seasonal dummies (3–12
i
and none), 3 deterministic speciﬁcations in the FAVAR model (none, constant and
such that we forecast 12 periods (1 year) for h ¼ 2. This forecast period is one of
relative economic and political stability in Mexico. For example, during this time
frame, the annual growth rate of Mexico’s GDP in any quarter was never lower than
2.3% and never higher than 2.8% (INEGI 2016). Moreover, the country’s economic
performance tends to be more volatile in times close to presidential elections in
Mexico, and to a lesser degree in the US, which do not coincide with our forecast
period. Statistically, this period represents around 10% of the number of
observations and discounting the degrees of freedom, we are able to represent
25% of T À K where K is the number of parameters in the FAVAR model.
For each model, we compute the forecast error. The forecasts are dynamic, so
that we update T þ 1 in each month. We selected the model that minimizes the Root
Mean Square Error (RMSE).15 Furthermore, we focus on the models that give a
forecast error lower than a threshold. This threshold is determined directly using
Eickmeier et al. (2014) as a reference. In their work they predict several
macroeconomic variables using FAVAR models, FAVAR-tv, FAVAR-tv with
stochastic volatility errors and univariate models. For one and two step ahead,
forecasting the US GDP, the RMSE values in in-sample forecasts are 0.76 and 0.80
considering all periods for h ¼ 1 and h ¼ 2; respectively. However, we select a
threshold of 0.5 to obtain more accurate forecasts. Note that, if we predict D ln xt for
the ﬁrst step ahead, the forecast error is eTþ1 ¼ ðln xTþ1 À ln xT ÞÀ
ðln xfTþ1 À ln xT Þ ¼ ln xTþ1 À ln xfTþ1 , i.e., it is equivalent to forecasting the level
of the ﬁrst step ahead. Therefore, we focus on the levels of the IGAE.
5.4 Using common trends to predict Mexican economic activity
First, in order to descriptively evaluate the predictive capacity of each variable, we
calculate the cross-correlation between yitÀh and xt and consequently:
qÃ ¼ corrðyitÀh ; xt Þjfmaxðh
h

12 : ProbðcorrðyitÀh ; xt ÞÞ\aÞg;

where a ¼ 0:05. Figure 4 plots the results of the previous equation. Note that the top
panel plots the qÃ with the conﬁdence interval. The middle panel shows their
h
corresponding maximum signiﬁcant lag, maxðh 12 : ProbðcorrðyitÀh ; xt ÞÞ\aÞ and
bottom panel presents the mean absolute correlations for each block of variables.
Note that the block of variables most highly correlated with the future of xt is the
miscellaneous one. It is interesting to note that all signiﬁcant variables of this block
are positively correlated with the IGAE. Other interesting variable blocks are the
economic activity and ﬁnancial groups. On the other hand, the blocks least correlated with the future of xt are consumer conﬁdence, employment, and prices.
15

As we have mentioned in the introduction, the goal of this paper is to forecast Mexican economic
activity. To this end, we have two measures: quarterly, GDP; and monthly, IGAE. In an early analysis, we
prove that IGAE is perfectly correlated with GDP. In this case, given the monthly frequency data, it is

common factors shows that the elements of Yt are cointegrated; hence, it is
reasonable to expect that the correlations between yit and xt are not spurious.
Once the models are estimated, we review the forecast errors lower than the
threshold in the training sample. Figure 5 plots the historical behavior of the RMSE
for the selected predictive models. The top panel plots the RMSE for h ¼ 1. Note
that the PC gives slightly more accurate results than PLS. Furthermore, the
dispersion of the RMSE for PLS is larger than PLS and neither approach presents
outliers. The bottom panel shows the results for h ¼ 2. We can see that for both
procedures, the forecast errors are slightly increased with respect to h ¼ 1. It is
interesting to mention that for both h the tails from both procedures are intercepted.
This graph is important because this behavior is expected for the following two
predicted months.
Using the models from Fig. 5 we predict two steps ahead: May and June 2016.
Note that we have n models, such that it is necessary to combine the forecasts. Thus
we propose a weighted average, obtaining loadings similar to the PLS procedure by
solving the following optimization problem:
q1 ¼ max corðX f w; xbÞ
w;b

subject to

VarðX f wÞ ¼ VarðxbÞ ¼ 1;

where w ¼ ðw1 ; . . .; wn Þ. In order to normalize the loading weights, we carry out the
P
following scaling: wÃ ¼ nð n wi ÞÀ1 w, such that the loading weights are between
i¼1
0 and 1. Figure 6 shows the forecast density, the predictions, and the observed data.
We plot the conﬁdence interval to 95%. Note that for h ¼ 1, PLS is more accurate
than PC, while for h ¼ 2, PLS is less accurate. The models are centered on the mean
of the distribution. Moreover, the forecast density acquires the observed data.
Furthermore, focusing on h ¼ 2, the distribution of PC has two modes and the
predicted data tend towards the center of the distribution. On the other hand, for
PLS, it tends towards the median of the distribution.
An interesting question is: which common trends are helpful to reduce forecast
error? To this end, we compute the following coefﬁcients through OLS:
oet jDti ¼ 1\0

and Probðoet jDti ¼ 1Þ\0:10

for i ¼ 1; . . .; Nm ;

where Nm is the number of models for each procedure. In other words, we carry out
a linear regression between the forecast errors according to each procedure and
dummy variables that specify the combination of common trends F1t , F2t , F3t , F4t ;
and F5t for both procedures. Figure 7 plots the result for each procedure in each h.
We can see that, in PC, F1t is a very important common factor to reduce the forecast
error for h ¼ 1, whereas F1t , F2t , F4t ; and F5t are important for h ¼ 2. Furthermore,
in the PLS approach F1t , F2t , F4t ; and F5t are relevant common factors for h ¼ 1
whereas F1t ; and F2t are for h ¼ 2. In fact, for both procedures the interaction of all
common factors is important to reduce the forecast errors. This result completes the
conclusions when we analyze Figs. 1 and 4, where all common factors are helpful to
reduce the forecast errors.
In order to evaluate the forecast accuracy in ‘‘real time,’’ we predict two steps ahead

as PC (2), (iii) PLS, (iv) PLS (2), (v) the average between the ﬁrst and third models, and
(vi) the average between the second and fourth models. We can see that for h ¼ 1 PLS,
PLS (2) and the forecast average of PC and PLS are the most accurate model with 0
forecast error for May 2016. For h ¼ 1, PC gives a forecast error of 0.1 in June 2016. In
conclusion, and with reference to Fig. 5, the results are as expected given that PC and
PLS give forecast errors lower than the selected threshold.
It is interesting to mention the historical behavior of the models. Hence, we ﬁrst
analyze the RMSE of the benchmark models: the Autoregressive Integrated Moving
Average (ARIMA) and the macroeconomic diffusion index (Stock and Watson

that the RMSE interval is between 0.82 and 1.07 for the ARIMA model, while for the
macroeconomic diffusion index it is between 0.62 and 0.83. For h ¼ 2 the errors are
slightly reduced in both cases; however, the macroeconomic diffusion index has better
results. Hence, note that the inclusion of the factor in linear models reduces the forecast
error. Then, we would expect the FAVAR models to show a small RMSE.16

Alternatively, we can consider RMSE in terms of benchmark models like several authors. However,
we decide to use the RMSE to easily verify whether the FAVAR models give RMSEs lower than the

considering the approach presented in this work. Note that the RMSE interval of
PC for h ¼ 1 is between 0.27 and 0.67 and for h ¼ 2 between 0.29 and 0.59. The
RMSE mean values are 0.47 and 0.44 for each h, respectively. Note that in both h,
February 2016 is the outlier forecast error. On the other hand, for PLS and h ¼ 1,
the forecast errors are between 0.34 and 0.60 and for h ¼ 2, the conﬁdence interval
is between 0.3 and 0.64. In this case, the mean of RMSE is 0.47 for each h,
respectively. Note that the improvement with respect to the ARIMA model and
macroeconomic diffusion index is relevant, above all when the factors are estimated
using PC. Note that the forecast errors are very similar between PC and PLS.
A question of interest is: are the models consistent through the training sample?
We can obtain different models in each step ahead, in which case the consistency of
the predictors may be questionable. Taking into account only the selected models,
we can observe in Fig. 11 that all models are robust in h ¼ 1. In fact, 76% of the
models are within the threshold and for h ¼ 2, the behavior of the predictions is
similar to May 2016. Note that the predictions for May and June 2016 are carried
out with information up to April 2016. Hence, we present the forecast in h ¼ 1 for
May 2016 and h ¼ 2 for June 2016. The model is not updated as in the previous
forecasts. It is interesting to note that February 2016 was the most complicated
month to predict; however, the robustness of the selected models is reasonable. The
reason why February 2016 was a complicated month to predict can be explained by
the fact that this month has 29 days, and the seasonal variables and the dynamics
between the variables do not account for this effect.

6 Conclusions and further research
In this paper we estimated the common trends of the Mexican economy using a large
dataset of macroeconomic variables. Using cointegration concepts, we estimated the
common trends using I(1) variables through PC, determining the number of common
factors according to the Onatski (2010) and the Ahn and Horenstein (2013)
procedures. Alternatively, we estimated the common factors using PLS.
We ﬁnd that 211 macroeconomic and ﬁnancial variables can be summarized in at
^
most r ¼ 5 common trends, which are cointegrated with Mexican economic
activity. Furthermore, we use the common trends in a FAVAR model with the aim
of predicting Mexican economic activity. We statistically evaluate the predictive
capacity of the common trends, where we can see that each common factor reduces
the forecast error. Additionally, we observe that the forecast error is reduced with
respect to the ARIMA and factor-augmented regressions, such that the common
trends are useful to predict Mexican economic activity.
An important conclusion is that the macroeconomic common trends can be used
in more sophisticated models in order to reduce the forecast errors. Additionally,
note that in this study we used data in levels in order to estimate the common
factors. This is empirical evidence on the use of DFMs when we do not transform

Economically, the more relevant groups of variables in the determination of the
common trends are the miscellaneous group, the economic activity, balance of
trade, and the industrial sector. The ﬁrst group of variables basically comprises
tourism information and variables related to the automotive industry. In this context,
the behaviors of the external sector and internal demand are very important to
predict the behavior of the global economy. It is reasonable to expect that external
uncertainty and disincentives in the internal market can be dangerous for future
economic growth. In other words, these groups of variables indicate the future
movements of Mexican economic activity.
A future line of research is to use the common trends in factor error correction
models (FECM), and FAVAR with time-varying coefﬁcients, among many other
models, combining the predictions with different combinations of forecasting
methods. Furthermore, we consider a unit root test that takes into account the
structural break that occurred between 2008 and 2009 in order to reﬁne the procedure
to select I(1) variables. Consequently, it is interesting to study the non-stationarity of
the estimated common factors in the presence of breaks. Additionally, we will take into
account the possibility of sparse cointegration for forecasting proposes.
