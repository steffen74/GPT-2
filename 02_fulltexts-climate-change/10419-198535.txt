Introduction
In recent years the issues of energy security and energy dependence have been subject to heated
debates due to their importance for the normal development and functioning of national economies.
It is an undeniable fact that in the twenty-first century the energy sec-tor affects both the everyday
lives of the ordinary people and the industry to such an extent that economies cannot exist without
such a sector. The importance of the energy sector makes all countries consider the issues of their
energy security and the reliability of their energy supply.
Bulgaria does not have significant sources of oil or natural gas in its territory. This is why it has
to meet its energy needs by importing energy from other countries. The continual import spins the
country in the spiral of energy dependence on the import of oil products, which negatively affects its
economy. The high dependence levels affect the overall economic stability of the country as well.
This research aims to determine the effects of the import of oil products and the degree of
diversification of energy supplies and suppliers for Bulgaria‚Äôs national economy by analysing the
factors that have negative effects on the energy security of the country.

1. Literature review
1.1. Energy security context
The topic of national energy security has been the focus of attention of many scholars for quite
a while. Numerous research studies in this field have shown that it is a topical and complex issue of
indisputable importance. The importance of energy security for each country is different and depends
on the role of the state in the trade process (M√ºller-Kraenner, 2007). Exporting countries consider
their energy security in terms of exporting their products on markets with good prices and minimal
risk exposures. Importing countries consider their energy security in terms of reliable supplies at
reasonable prices.
In his research Alhajji (5 November 2007) notes that governments often consider the energy
security concept only in terms of oil products. This fact is not surprising, because oil products are a
key resource for energy importers. This is why oil products have been a priority factor in defining
energy security policies for a long time. Besides, most of the energy security literature is concerned
exclusively with oil products (Fried and Trezise 1993; Stringer, 2008) since these products play the
most important role in the global economy and trade (Noreng, 2002).
1.2. Import dependence context
Energy dependence is usually considered the main factor that defines the level of risk for a
country‚Äôs energy security. Many authors relate energy security to energy dependence due to the
effect of this type of dependence on the security of the national economy. The research studies in

this field were carried out using various research methods. Such an ex-ample is the research of
Nicholas M. Odhiambo (2014), who studied energy security in the context of developing
countries‚Äô energy dependence using an Autoregressive Distributed-lag (ARDL) - bounds Testing
Approach. Kamonphorn Kanchanaa, Benjamin C. McLellan and Hironobu Unesak (2016)
analysed the international dimension of energy security by com-piling a composite energy
dependence indicator.
The core of this research is based on the model adopted by the International Energy Agency
(International Energy Agency, 2011) to evaluate energy security risks using a wide range of
indicators. Indicators of key importance are the energy dependence and the diversity of suppliers,
which is calculated using Herfindahl-Hirschman index, which is a measure of the concentration of
supply. Our research is based on the same methodology for calculating these two indicators in order
to determine their effect for Bulgaria‚Äôs energy security.
2. Research methodology
This research is focused mainly on Bulgaria‚Äôs dependence on the import of oil products and its
effect on the energy security of the country. The empirical analysis comprises two distinct stages - an
analysis of Bulgaria‚Äôs dependence on the import of oil products, followed by a study of the
diversification of suppliers and supplies. It aims to determine the degree of the country‚Äôs energy
dependence and import structure and their effect on Bulgaria‚Äôs energy dependence over a period of
ten years from 2005 to 2015.
Methods for evaluation of the energy dependency
Energy dependency is evaluated using the methodology adopted by Eurostat. It is based on the
ratio of the import of oil products to the gross inland consumption. This ratio shows the country‚Äôs
degree of dependency on imports to meet its inland consumption. The result is expressed as a
percentage that shows the share of import in the inland consumption and is calculated using the
following equation:
ID = (ùêºùëöùëùùëúùëüùë°/ùê∫ùêºùê∏ùê∂) √ó 100
(1)
where:
ID is import dependence

Imports ‚Äì the volume of imported oil products
GIEC- Gross Inland Energy Consumption of Oil Products
Diversification index ‚Äì methodology
In this part of the study we analysed the structure of import in terms of the existing
diversification of suppliers and supplies. The diversity of suppliers is calculated based on the number
of suppliers for the corresponding year. The diversity of supplies is calculated using the Herfindahl‚Äì
Hirschman index. This methodology is used by the International Energy Agency and is described in
a brochure for the MOSES model (InternatIonal Energy Agency 2011). The Herfindahl‚ÄìHirschman
index is a measure of the concentration of supply and the existence of monopolistic markets.
N

HHI = ‚àë si2
i=1

(2)
This index is calculated by squaring the market share of the import of each firm competing in
a market, and then summing the resulting numbers. Equation (2) can be expressed as:
HHI = s12 + s22 + s32 + ‚ãØ + sn2
(3)
where s is the market share of each firm.
There are two methods for calculating the market share and, respectively, for evaluating the
index. The first method calculates the market share of the companies as a whole number (a percentage
of the total market volume) and the squared percentage points are summed. When this method is used,
HHI may reach a maximum of 10 000 units. All values below 1000 units mean that the market is
highly diversified and a value of 10 000 means that there is a monopolistic market.
The second method uses market shares expressed as decimal fractions (rather than percentages)
and the index is the sum of their squares. In this case the index ranges between 0 and 1 (0< n <1),
where a value of 0 mean that the market is highly diversified and a value of 1 means that there is a
monopolistic market. The IEA categorizes the diversity of supplies based on the Herfindahl‚Äì
Hirschman index into three ranges: high diversity; medium diversity and low diversity (International
Energy Agency, 2011). According to this scale, all markets within the range of n<0.3 have high

diversity of supplies; those within the range of 0.3< n <0.8 have medium diversity of supplies and
those with indices exceeding 0.8 have low diversity of supplies.
For our research we used the second method for calculating the Herfindahl‚ÄìHirschman index,
which calculates the index using squared decimal fractions. Diversification is assessed using the scale
adopted by the International Energy Agency (IEA). The results from the analyses of the import
dependence, the number of suppliers and the Herfindahl‚ÄìHirschman‚Äôs index show the effect of these
factors on Bulgaria‚Äôs energy security.
3. Characteristics of Bulgaria‚Äôs Primary Production, Gross Inland Energy Consumption,
Import and Export of Oil Products
This section provides a review of the organization of the oil market and the four main indicators
related to Bulgaria‚Äôs production, consumption, import, and export of oil products. The aim of this
review is to give us a general idea of the importance of oil products as an element of Bulgaria‚Äôs energy
mix. The indicators are reviewed in the following order: (1) primary production (PP) of oil products;
(2) gross inland energy consumption (GIEC); (3) import; (4) export. First, however, we should
consider the specific characteristics of the market for crude oil and oil products in Bulgaria.
Unlike the natural gas and electricity markets, the crude oil market in the country is fully
liberalized. The companies operating on it are not owned or controlled by the state-owned Bulgarian
Energy Holding (BEH).1 Note that one of the biggest refineries on the Balkan Peninsula is located in
Bulgaria. According to information2 from the Ministry of Energy it is controlled with a majority stake
by the Russian company Lukoil (Ministry of Energy 2015).
LUKOIL Bulgaria EOOD and LUKOIL Neftohim Burgas AD also operate on the territory of
the country. Both companies are owned by the Russian company Lukoil. LUKOIL Bulgaria EOOD,
which owns the Rosenets port terminal and a refinery, is the biggest company in Bulgaria. According
to information published by the company itself, its contribution to the state budget is ¬º of the total
state budget revenue. The company is a major supplier and leader in the distribution of the fuels and
petrochemicals produced by LUKOIL Neftohim Burgas AD. The latter owns of a large chain of gas

Bulgarian Energy Holding EAD is a holding company that owns companies specialized in production and transmission
of electricity; transmission, transit and storage of natural gas, and lignite extraction. The Holding Group of BEH EAD
holds a key position on the natural gas and electricity market in Bulgaria as well as in the region due to its export of
electricity. The company is 100% owned by the Bulgarian state and is the largest state-owned company in the country in
terms of own assets. Its ownership rights are vested in the Minister of Energy.

stations on the territory of Bulgaria and has a large share of the market for fuels, petroleum products
and polymers both in Bulgaria and in the Central and Eastern European countries.
Other companies that operate on the oil and oil products market are:
ÔÇ∑

PETROL AD - a private company, which is the leader in the distribution of fuels in the country.
It owns more than 500 gas stations, 80 oil bases and three port terminals for petroleum products.

ÔÇ∑

PRISTA OIL AD - Bulgaria - the company is part of PRISTA OIL Group, which owns
subsidiaries all over Europe and deals with production, distribution, sale and marketing of oils,
greases, brake fluids and other oil products.

ÔÇ∑

NIS PETROL EOOD, owned by Neftena Industria Serbia (NIS) - one of the largest oil companies
in Southeastern Europe. Note that its majority shareholder (with a majority stake of 56.6% of its
equity) is the Russian company Gazprom Neft. In Bulgaria the company operates under the brand
"Gazprom" and owns a number of gas stations under the same brand (Ministy of Energy, 2016).
The market structure described above leads to the conclusion that the Russian Lukoil and its

affiliated companies are leaders on the oil market in Bulgaria. Russia is the country‚Äôs main supplier
of crude oil because of the technological characteristics of the existing refinery in Bulgaria and the
characteristics of the oil it processes. Note that the physical properties and the exact chemical
composition of the crude oil vary depending on the location of the deposits. Therefore, oil refiners
are adapted to a certain type of oil and must undergo certain technological modification in order to
process other types of oil.
The output of Bulgaria‚Äôs only refinery is essential for the energy security and stability of the
country because of its market orientation. Despite the relatively small quantities of oil extracted on
its territory, the country‚Äôs market orientation is towards export of processed oil products. The
uninterrupted supply of oil from Russia is essential for Bulgaria and its energy security. Its importance
for the country‚Äôs oil industry is analysed in the following sections.
3.1. Primary production of oil products
Bulgaria‚Äôs deposits of oil and natural gas are insignificant and this is why the volume of its
primary production of oil products is extremely low and cannot meet the demand for such products
(see Figure 1).

Figure 1. Primary production of oil products in Bulgaria in the period 2005-2015 (in
thousand tonnes of oil equivalent (Ktoe))

Source: Author‚Äôs representation using data from Eurostat database

During the period (2005 ‚Äì 2015) there was a steady downward trend in the production of oil
products until 2011, followed in 2012 and 2013 by an increase that may be defined as insignificant,
because the total volume of production increased only to 27.3 Ktoe.
3.2. Gross inland energy consumption
Bulgaria‚Äôs inland consumption of oil products consists mainly of consumption of fuels. This is
why GIEC3 remained high, fluctuating between 3 669 Ktoe and 4 956.3 Ktoe (see Figure 2) between
2005 and 2015. Consumption was decreasing until 2013, and then started to increase quite rapidly to
reach 3 879.5 Ktoe in 2014 and 4 200.8 Ktoe in 2015.

thousand tonnes of oil equivalent (Ktoe))

GIEC ‚Äì Gross Inland Energy Consumption

The comparative analysis of GIEC and PP4 for each year shows that the country relies heavily
on the import of oil products. The extremely low volumes of PP and the high levels of consumption
show extremely high levels of import dependence and corresponding levels of risk for the energy
security of the country.
3.3. Export
Export data show that the country exports large volumes of processed oil products (see Figure
3). Despite the low levels of primary production, the country specializes in the export of processed
oil products (mainly fuels). The difference between the PP volumes and the export volumes is
compensated with import of crude oil.
Figure 3. Bulgaria‚Äôs export of oil products in the period 2005-2015 (in thousand tonnes of
oil equivalent (Ktoe))

Source: Author‚Äôs representation using data from Eurostat database

The export trend shows an increase in the exported quantities of oil products. The highest
volume was being reached in 2015 (4 481,2 Ktoe) and the lowest volume in the export values was
reported in 2005 (2605 Ktoe) and 2009 (3167.4 Ktoe). Despite this decline the trend remains growing.
The increasing in the export values in the case of Bulgaria is a prerequisite for increasing in the
quantities of the imports of oil products due to the low oil reserves.
3.4. Import
Taking into account the data for the PP, the GIEC and the export volumes, the volumes of import
are predictably high because they have to cover the difference between the PP on the one hand, and the
GIEC and the export of oil product, on the other. Imports peaked in 2015 at 8 732.3 Ktoe (see Figure 4).

PP ‚Äì Primary Production
Figure 4. Bulgaria‚Äôs import of oil products in the period 2005-2015 (in thousand tonnes of

According to the reported data, imports declined in two of the years within the analysed period
‚Äì in 2005 (7548.1 Ktoe) and in 2011 (7 219.6 Ktoe.) The highest volume of imported oil products
(8 732.3 Ktoe) was reported in 2015. The analysis of the import volumes shows that there is a trend
of their increasing steadily over the period. Although rate of increase is categorized as moderate, the
level of import volumes poses a risk for the energy security of the country.
4. Empirical research results
This section presents the results from the empirical study. The analysis shows an interesting trend
in terms of the percentile import dependence and the directly proportional relation between the number
of suppliers of oil products and the diversification index. The results are shown in Table 1 below.

The results in the above table show that Bulgaria is highly dependent on its import of oil
products with dependence levels reaching values of over 235% over the consumption in 2013. On the
surface such large volumes of import may seem illogical and unjustified. However, they are justified
by Bulgaria‚Äôs orientation on the market of oil products. Despite its limited sources of oil, the country
imports large volumes of crude oil products which are processed and exported as fuels.
The curve of the import of oil products peaked in 2013 and then went down again (Figure 5.)
The increase of import dependence while the consumption is decreasing (Figure 5) is due to the
increase of the exported volumes of processed fuels.

Although import dependence itself poses a risk for Bulgaria‚Äôs energy security, this risk can be
mitigated to levels that do not jeopardize the country‚Äôs economy by means of diversification of its
suppliers and supply. Note that these two terms are markedly different. From a theoretical point of
view, in the presence of a large number of suppliers, there will be an almost symmetrical distribution
of supply, which indicates a high diversity of supply. In this case, the risk has values that assign our
country to the group of the countries with low dependency on supplier countries.
There is another scenario as well, in which the number of suppliers is also large, but the bulk
of the import is concentrated in one or a few large importers and the other suppliers import
insignificant or supplementary volumes. In this scenario, the risk for the country's energy security
increases significantly. Depending on the degree of concentration of imports, the country can be
placed in a situation that makes it highly vulnerable to suppliers of oil products.
The result of the research show that the number of Bulgaria‚Äôs suppliers of oil products varies
between 24 (in 2012) and 32 (in 2015.) This means that the level of diversification of suppliers of oil
products is good. Therefore, the country‚Äôs risk exposure should be defined by analysing its import

concentration, i.e. the diversification of supply. Bulgaria‚Äôs Herfindahl‚ÄìHirschman index varies
between 0.367 (in 2007) and 0.647 (in 2012.). According to the rating scale of the International
Energy Agency (InternatIonal Energy Agency 2011) these values rank as medium import
diversification. The closer to 1 are the values if the index, the greater is the exposure to energy security
risk of the country that imports the product. A high risk exposure means a higher dependence of the
country on its suppliers. In this respect Bulgaria‚Äôs risk exposure is relatively high, since about 77%
of its oil products are imported by one supplier - Russia.
The high concentration of supply in terms of a single major supplier is a prerequisite for
increasing both the energy and the economic risk for Bulgaria. Given the degree of energy dependence
on Russia and the fact that it is a major supplier of oil to the Bulgarian refinery, we may conclude
that our energy sector is highly vulnerable to external factors. Given the small quantities of oil
extracted in the country, the disruption of supply would have a negative impact on consumption as
well as the country's export of processed oil products. Accordingly, this would have a serious negative
impact on the country's economic stability.
The high dependence on imported oil increases Bulgaria's susceptibility to foreign political and
geopolitical pressure. The low degree of external resistance to such pressure poses serious risks for
the country and all sectors of its economy in terms of pressure for adoptions of policies that are not
in the best interest of the state. The pursuit of a policy contrary to the interests of the state is likely to
generate negative effects on the sustainable development of the country's economy.
The above analysis shows that energy dependence is one of the key factors for determining the
country's energy security and economic stability because the conditions of the energy sector affects
all other sectors of our economy. At high levels of energy dependence, the risk can be mitigated to
levels that do not jeopardize the country's energy security through diversification. Note that in order
to mitigate the energy risk we need not only diversification of the suppliers, but also diversification
of supplies. In some cases, as is the case with Bulgaria, the level of diversification of suppliers may
satisfactory, but the supply of a certain commodity may be concentrated in one or a few major
suppliers while the rest import insignificant or complementary quantities. Diversification of suppliers
is a misleading indicator because it may inadvertently conceal the presence of concentration of
supplies. This in turn generates a hidden risk for the country. Due to the fact that the latter may remain
covert, it may have a strong negative impact on the country's economy and its degree and importance
may prove to be serious.

Conclusions
The research analysed the effects of energy dependence and import structure on Bulgaria‚Äôs
energy security. The dependence was determined by calculating the ratio of energy dependence on
the import of oil products to the consumption of such products in the period 2005 - 2015. Import
structure was analysed using the number of suppliers and the degree of diversification in terms of the
Herfindahl‚ÄìHirschman‚Äôs index.
The results of this research show that Bulgaria is heavily dependent on imports of oil products,
with the percentage of its dependence reaching levels that are twice as high as its consumption of
such products. There are two reasons for this situation ‚Äì the lack of significant oil deposits on the
territory of the country and the fact that Bulgaria exports large amounts of the imported oil product
as processed fuels.
The analysis of the diversification of suppliers and the diversification of supply shows that
despite the large number of suppliers of oil products, the import structure is not diversified
sufficiently. This means that import is concentrated in one or a few large importers while the other
suppliers import insignificant or supplementary volumes of oil products. This import structure places
Bulgaria in a vulnerable position as it depends on just one main supplier, which poses a significant
risk for the energy security of the country. Taking into account the degree of dependence on the
import of oil products as well, we may conclude that Bulgaria is exposed to a significant energy
security risk in terms of its import of oil products ‚Äì a situation that calls for a careful risk management
and re-considering of the import structure.

indisputable importance. The importance of energy security for each country is different and depends

diversity of supplies; those within the range of 0.3< n <0.8 have medium diversity of supplies and
those with indices exceeding 0.8 have low diversity of supplies.
For our research we used the second method for calculating the Herfindahl‚ÄìHirschman index,

3. Characteristics of Bulgaria‚Äôs Primary Production, Gross Inland Energy Consumption,
Import and Export of Oil Products
This section provides a review of the organization of the oil market and the four main indicators
related to Bulgaria‚Äôs production, consumption, import, and export of oil products. The aim of this
review is to give us a general idea of the importance of oil products as an element of Bulgaria‚Äôs energy
mix. The indicators are reviewed in the following order: (1) primary production (PP) of oil products;
(2) gross inland energy consumption (GIEC); (3) import; (4) export. First, however, we should
consider the specific characteristics of the market for crude oil and oil products in Bulgaria.
Unlike the natural gas and electricity markets, the crude oil market in the country is fully
liberalized. The companies operating on it are not owned or controlled by the state-owned Bulgarian
Energy Holding (BEH).1 Note that one of the biggest refineries on the Balkan Peninsula is located in
Bulgaria. According to information2 from the Ministry of Energy it is controlled with a majority stake
by the Russian company Lukoil (Ministry of Energy 2015).
LUKOIL Bulgaria EOOD and LUKOIL Neftohim Burgas AD also operate on the territory of
the country. Both companies are owned by the Russian company Lukoil. LUKOIL Bulgaria EOOD,
which owns the Rosenets port terminal and a refinery, is the biggest company in Bulgaria. According
to information published by the company itself, its contribution to the state budget is ¬º of the total
state budget revenue. The company is a major supplier and leader in the distribution of the fuels and
petrochemicals produced by LUKOIL Neftohim Burgas AD. The latter owns of a large chain of gas

stations on the territory of Bulgaria and has a large share of the market for fuels, petroleum products
and polymers both in Bulgaria and in the Central and Eastern European countries.
Other companies that operate on the oil and oil products market are:
ÔÇ∑

PETROL AD - a private company, which is the leader in the distribution of fuels in the country.
It owns more than 500 gas stations, 80 oil bases and three port terminals for petroleum products.

ÔÇ∑

PRISTA OIL AD - Bulgaria - the company is part of PRISTA OIL Group, which owns
subsidiaries all over Europe and deals with production, distribution, sale and marketing of oils,
greases, brake fluids and other oil products.

ÔÇ∑

NIS PETROL EOOD, owned by Neftena Industria Serbia (NIS) - one of the largest oil companies
in Southeastern Europe. Note that its majority shareholder (with a majority stake of 56.6% of its
equity) is the Russian company Gazprom Neft. In Bulgaria the company operates under the brand
"Gazprom" and owns a number of gas stations under the same brand (Ministy of Energy, 2016).
The market structure described above leads to the conclusion that the Russian Lukoil and its

affiliated companies are leaders on the oil market in Bulgaria. Russia is the country‚Äôs main supplier
of crude oil because of the technological characteristics of the existing refinery in Bulgaria and the
characteristics of the oil it processes. Note that the physical properties and the exact chemical
composition of the crude oil vary depending on the location of the deposits. Therefore, oil refiners
are adapted to a certain type of oil and must undergo certain technological modification in order to
process other types of oil.
The output of Bulgaria‚Äôs only refinery is essential for the energy security and stability of the
country because of its market orientation. Despite the relatively small quantities of oil extracted on
its territory, the country‚Äôs market orientation is towards export of processed oil products. The
uninterrupted supply of oil from Russia is essential for Bulgaria and its energy security. Its importance
for the country‚Äôs oil industry is analysed in the following sections.
3.1. Primary production of oil products
Bulgaria‚Äôs deposits of oil and natural gas are insignificant and this is why the volume of its
primary production of oil products is extremely low and cannot meet the demand for such products
(see Figure 1).

Figure 1. Primary production of oil products in Bulgaria in the period 2005-2015 (in
thousand tonnes of oil equivalent (Ktoe))

Source: Author‚Äôs representation using data from Eurostat database

During the period (2005 ‚Äì 2015) there was a steady downward trend in the production of oil
products until 2011, followed in 2012 and 2013 by an increase that may be defined as insignificant,
because the total volume of production increased only to 27.3 Ktoe.
3.2. Gross inland energy consumption
Bulgaria‚Äôs inland consumption of oil products consists mainly of consumption of fuels. This is
why GIEC3 remained high, fluctuating between 3 669 Ktoe and 4 956.3 Ktoe (see Figure 2) between
2005 and 2015. Consumption was decreasing until 2013, and then started to increase quite rapidly to
reach 3 879.5 Ktoe in 2014 and 4 200.8 Ktoe in 2015.

GIEC ‚Äì Gross Inland Energy Consumption

The comparative analysis of GIEC and PP4 for each year shows that the country relies heavily
on the import of oil products. The extremely low volumes of PP and the high levels of consumption
show extremely high levels of import dependence and corresponding levels of risk for the energy
security of the country.
3.3. Export
Export data show that the country exports large volumes of processed oil products (see Figure
3). Despite the low levels of primary production, the country specializes in the export of processed
oil products (mainly fuels). The difference between the PP volumes and the export volumes is
compensated with import of crude oil.
Figure 3. Bulgaria‚Äôs export of oil products in the period 2005-2015 (in thousand tonnes of
oil equivalent (Ktoe))

Source: Author‚Äôs representation using data from Eurostat database

The export trend shows an increase in the exported quantities of oil products. The highest
volume was being reached in 2015 (4 481,2 Ktoe) and the lowest volume in the export values was
reported in 2005 (2605 Ktoe) and 2009 (3167.4 Ktoe). Despite this decline the trend remains growing.
The increasing in the export values in the case of Bulgaria is a prerequisite for increasing in the
quantities of the imports of oil products due to the low oil reserves.
3.4. Import
Taking into account the data for the PP, the GIEC and the export volumes, the volumes of import
are predictably high because they have to cover the difference between the PP on the one hand, and the
GIEC and the export of oil product, on the other. Imports peaked in 2015 at 8 732.3 Ktoe (see Figure 4).

PP ‚Äì Primary Production

According to the reported data, imports declined in two of the years within the analysed period
‚Äì in 2005 (7548.1 Ktoe) and in 2011 (7 219.6 Ktoe.) The highest volume of imported oil products
(8 732.3 Ktoe) was reported in 2015. The analysis of the import volumes shows that there is a trend
of their increasing steadily over the period. Although rate of increase is categorized as moderate, the
level of import volumes poses a risk for the energy security of the country.
4. Empirical research results
This section presents the results from the empirical study. The analysis shows an interesting trend
in terms of the percentile import dependence and the directly proportional relation between the number
of suppliers of oil products and the diversification index. The results are shown in Table 1 below.

The results in the above table show that Bulgaria is highly dependent on its import of oil
products with dependence levels reaching values of over 235% over the consumption in 2013. On the
surface such large volumes of import may seem illogical and unjustified. However, they are justified
by Bulgaria‚Äôs orientation on the market of oil products. Despite its limited sources of oil, the country
imports large volumes of crude oil products which are processed and exported as fuels.
The curve of the import of oil products peaked in 2013 and then went down again (Figure 5.)
The increase of import dependence while the consumption is decreasing (Figure 5) is due to the
increase of the exported volumes of processed fuels.
Figure 5. Bulgaria‚Äôs dependence on the import of oil products (2005-2015)

Source: Author‚Äôs own calculations

Although import dependence itself poses a risk for Bulgaria‚Äôs energy security, this risk can be
mitigated to levels that do not jeopardize the country‚Äôs economy by means of diversification of its
suppliers and supply. Note that these two terms are markedly different. From a theoretical point of
view, in the presence of a large number of suppliers, there will be an almost symmetrical distribution
of supply, which indicates a high diversity of supply. In this case, the risk has values that assign our
country to the group of the countries with low dependency on supplier countries.
There is another scenario as well, in which the number of suppliers is also large, but the bulk
of the import is concentrated in one or a few large importers and the other suppliers import
insignificant or supplementary volumes. In this scenario, the risk for the country's energy security
increases significantly. Depending on the degree of concentration of imports, the country can be
placed in a situation that makes it highly vulnerable to suppliers of oil products.
The result of the research show that the number of Bulgaria‚Äôs suppliers of oil products varies
between 24 (in 2012) and 32 (in 2015.) This means that the level of diversification of suppliers of oil
products is good. Therefore, the country‚Äôs risk exposure should be defined by analysing its import

concentration, i.e. the diversification of supply. Bulgaria‚Äôs Herfindahl‚ÄìHirschman index varies
between 0.367 (in 2007) and 0.647 (in 2012.). According to the rating scale of the International
Energy Agency (InternatIonal Energy Agency 2011) these values rank as medium import
diversification. The closer to 1 are the values if the index, the greater is the exposure to energy security
risk of the country that imports the product. A high risk exposure means a higher dependence of the
country on its suppliers. In this respect Bulgaria‚Äôs risk exposure is relatively high, since about 77%
of its oil products are imported by one supplier - Russia.
The high concentration of supply in terms of a single major supplier is a prerequisite for
increasing both the energy and the economic risk for Bulgaria. Given the degree of energy dependence
on Russia and the fact that it is a major supplier of oil to the Bulgarian refinery, we may conclude
that our energy sector is highly vulnerable to external factors. Given the small quantities of oil
extracted in the country, the disruption of supply would have a negative impact on consumption as
well as the country's export of processed oil products. Accordingly, this would have a serious negative
impact on the country's economic stability.
The high dependence on imported oil increases Bulgaria's susceptibility to foreign political and
geopolitical pressure. The low degree of external resistance to such pressure poses serious risks for
the country and all sectors of its economy in terms of pressure for adoptions of policies that are not
in the best interest of the state. The pursuit of a policy contrary to the interests of the state is likely to
generate negative effects on the sustainable development of the country's economy.
The above analysis shows that energy dependence is one of the key factors for determining the
country's energy security and economic stability because the conditions of the energy sector affects
all other sectors of our economy. At high levels of energy dependence, the risk can be mitigated to
levels that do not jeopardize the country's energy security through diversification. Note that in order
to mitigate the energy risk we need not only diversification of the suppliers, but also diversification
of supplies. In some cases, as is the case with Bulgaria, the level of diversification of suppliers may
satisfactory, but the supply of a certain commodity may be concentrated in one or a few major
suppliers while the rest import insignificant or complementary quantities. Diversification of suppliers
is a misleading indicator because it may inadvertently conceal the presence of concentration of
supplies. This in turn generates a hidden risk for the country. Due to the fact that the latter may remain
covert, it may have a strong negative impact on the country's economy and its degree and importance
may prove to be serious.

Conclusions
The research analysed the effects of energy dependence and import structure on Bulgaria‚Äôs
energy security. The dependence was determined by calculating the ratio of energy dependence on
the import of oil products to the consumption of such products in the period 2005 - 2015. Import
structure was analysed using the number of suppliers and the degree of diversification in terms of the
Herfindahl‚ÄìHirschman‚Äôs index.
The results of this research show that Bulgaria is heavily dependent on imports of oil products,
with the percentage of its dependence reaching levels that are twice as high as its consumption of
such products. There are two reasons for this situation ‚Äì the lack of significant oil deposits on the
territory of the country and the fact that Bulgaria exports large amounts of the imported oil product
as processed fuels.
The analysis of the diversification of suppliers and the diversification of supply shows that
despite the large number of suppliers of oil products, the import structure is not diversified
sufficiently. This means that import is concentrated in one or a few large importers while the other
suppliers import insignificant or supplementary volumes of oil products. This import structure places
Bulgaria in a vulnerable position as it depends on just one main supplier, which poses a significant
risk for the energy security of the country. Taking into account the degree of dependence on the
import of oil products as well, we may conclude that Bulgaria is exposed to a significant energy
security risk in terms of its import of oil products ‚Äì a situation that calls for a careful risk management
and re-considering of the import structure.

Introduction
In recent years the issues of energy security and energy dependence have been subject to heated
debates due to their importance for the normal development and functioning of national economies.
It is an undeniable fact that in the twenty-first century the energy sec-tor affects both the everyday
lives of the ordinary people and the industry to such an extent that economies cannot exist without
such a sector. The importance of the energy sector makes all countries consider the issues of their
energy security and the reliability of their energy supply.
Bulgaria does not have significant sources of oil or natural gas in its territory. This is why it has
to meet its energy needs by importing energy from other countries. The continual import spins the
country in the spiral of energy dependence on the import of oil products, which negatively affects its
economy. The high dependence levels affect the overall economic stability of the country as well.
This research aims to determine the effects of the import of oil products and the degree of
diversification of energy supplies and suppliers for Bulgaria‚Äôs national economy by analysing the
factors that have negative effects on the energy security of the country.

1. Literature review
1.1. Energy security context
The topic of national energy security has been the focus of attention of many scholars for quite
a while. Numerous research studies in this field have shown that it is a topical and complex issue of
indisputable importance. The importance of energy security for each country is different and depends
on the role of the state in the trade process (M√ºller-Kraenner, 2007). Exporting countries consider
their energy security in terms of exporting their products on markets with good prices and minimal
risk exposures. Importing countries consider their energy security in terms of reliable supplies at
reasonable prices.
In his research Alhajji (5 November 2007) notes that governments often consider the energy
security concept only in terms of oil products. This fact is not surprising, because oil products are a
key resource for energy importers. This is why oil products have been a priority factor in defining
energy security policies for a long time. Besides, most of the energy security literature is concerned
exclusively with oil products (Fried and Trezise 1993; Stringer, 2008) since these products play the
most important role in the global economy and trade (Noreng, 2002).
1.2. Import dependence context
Energy dependence is usually considered the main factor that defines the level of risk for a
country‚Äôs energy security. Many authors relate energy security to energy dependence due to the
effect of this type of dependence on the security of the national economy. The research studies in

this field were carried out using various research methods. Such an ex-ample is the research of
Nicholas M. Odhiambo (2014), who studied energy security in the context of developing
countries‚Äô energy dependence using an Autoregressive Distributed-lag (ARDL) - bounds Testing
Approach. Kamonphorn Kanchanaa, Benjamin C. McLellan and Hironobu Unesak (2016)
analysed the international dimension of energy security by com-piling a composite energy
dependence indicator.
The core of this research is based on the model adopted by the International Energy Agency
(International Energy Agency, 2011) to evaluate energy security risks using a wide range of
indicators. Indicators of key importance are the energy dependence and the diversity of suppliers,
which is calculated using Herfindahl-Hirschman index, which is a measure of the concentration of
supply. Our research is based on the same methodology for calculating these two indicators in order
to determine their effect for Bulgaria‚Äôs energy security.
2. Research methodology
This research is focused mainly on Bulgaria‚Äôs dependence on the import of oil products and its
effect on the energy security of the country. The empirical analysis comprises two distinct stages - an
analysis of Bulgaria‚Äôs dependence on the import of oil products, followed by a study of the
diversification of suppliers and supplies. It aims to determine the degree of the country‚Äôs energy
dependence and import structure and their effect on Bulgaria‚Äôs energy dependence over a period of
ten years from 2005 to 2015.
Methods for evaluation of the energy dependency
Energy dependency is evaluated using the methodology adopted by Eurostat. It is based on the
ratio of the import of oil products to the gross inland consumption. This ratio shows the country‚Äôs
degree of dependency on imports to meet its inland consumption. The result is expressed as a
percentage that shows the share of import in the inland consumption and is calculated using the
following equation:
ID = (ùêºùëöùëùùëúùëüùë°/ùê∫ùêºùê∏ùê∂) √ó 100
(1)
where:
ID is import dependence

Imports ‚Äì the volume of imported oil products
GIEC- Gross Inland Energy Consumption of Oil Products
Diversification index ‚Äì methodology
In this part of the study we analysed the structure of import in terms of the existing
diversification of suppliers and supplies. The diversity of suppliers is calculated based on the number
of suppliers for the corresponding year. The diversity of supplies is calculated using the Herfindahl‚Äì
Hirschman index. This methodology is used by the International Energy Agency and is described in
a brochure for the MOSES model (InternatIonal Energy Agency 2011). The Herfindahl‚ÄìHirschman
index is a measure of the concentration of supply and the existence of monopolistic markets.
N

HHI = ‚àë si2
i=1

(2)
This index is calculated by squaring the market share of the import of each firm competing in
a market, and then summing the resulting numbers. Equation (2) can be expressed as:
HHI = s12 + s22 + s32 + ‚ãØ + sn2
(3)
where s is the market share of each firm.
There are two methods for calculating the market share and, respectively, for evaluating the
index. The first method calculates the market share of the companies as a whole number (a percentage
of the total market volume) and the squared percentage points are summed. When this method is used,
HHI may reach a maximum of 10 000 units. All values below 1000 units mean that the market is
highly diversified and a value of 10 000 means that there is a monopolistic market.
The second method uses market shares expressed as decimal fractions (rather than percentages)
and the index is the sum of their squares. In this case the index ranges between 0 and 1 (0< n <1),
where a value of 0 mean that the market is highly diversified and a value of 1 means that there is a
monopolistic market. The IEA categorizes the diversity of supplies based on the Herfindahl‚Äì
Hirschman index into three ranges: high diversity; medium diversity and low diversity (International
Energy Agency, 2011). According to this scale, all markets within the range of n<0.3 have high

diversity of supplies; those within the range of 0.3< n <0.8 have medium diversity of supplies and
those with indices exceeding 0.8 have low diversity of supplies.
For our research we used the second method for calculating the Herfindahl‚ÄìHirschman index,
which calculates the index using squared decimal fractions. Diversification is assessed using the scale
adopted by the International Energy Agency (IEA). The results from the analyses of the import
dependence, the number of suppliers and the Herfindahl‚ÄìHirschman‚Äôs index show the effect of these
factors on Bulgaria‚Äôs energy security.
3. Characteristics of Bulgaria‚Äôs Primary Production, Gross Inland Energy Consumption,
Import and Export of Oil Products
This section provides a review of the organization of the oil market and the four main indicators
related to Bulgaria‚Äôs production, consumption, import, and export of oil products. The aim of this
review is to give us a general idea of the importance of oil products as an element of Bulgaria‚Äôs energy
mix. The indicators are reviewed in the following order: (1) primary production (PP) of oil products;
(2) gross inland energy consumption (GIEC); (3) import; (4) export. First, however, we should
consider the specific characteristics of the market for crude oil and oil products in Bulgaria.
Unlike the natural gas and electricity markets, the crude oil market in the country is fully
liberalized. The companies operating on it are not owned or controlled by the state-owned Bulgarian
Energy Holding (BEH).1 Note that one of the biggest refineries on the Balkan Peninsula is located in
Bulgaria. According to information2 from the Ministry of Energy it is controlled with a majority stake
by the Russian company Lukoil (Ministry of Energy 2015).
LUKOIL Bulgaria EOOD and LUKOIL Neftohim Burgas AD also operate on the territory of
the country. Both companies are owned by the Russian company Lukoil. LUKOIL Bulgaria EOOD,
which owns the Rosenets port terminal and a refinery, is the biggest company in Bulgaria. According
to information published by the company itself, its contribution to the state budget is ¬º of the total
state budget revenue. The company is a major supplier and leader in the distribution of the fuels and
petrochemicals produced by LUKOIL Neftohim Burgas AD. The latter owns of a large chain of gas

Other companies that operate on the oil and oil products market are:
ÔÇ∑

PETROL AD - a private company, which is the leader in the distribution of fuels in the country.
It owns more than 500 gas stations, 80 oil bases and three port terminals for petroleum products.

ÔÇ∑

PRISTA OIL AD - Bulgaria - the company is part of PRISTA OIL Group, which owns
subsidiaries all over Europe and deals with production, distribution, sale and marketing of oils,

in Southeastern Europe. Note that its majority shareholder (with a majority stake of 56.6% of its
equity) is the Russian company Gazprom Neft. In Bulgaria the company operates under the brand
"Gazprom" and owns a number of gas stations under the same brand (Ministy of Energy, 2016).
The market structure described above leads to the conclusion that the Russian Lukoil and its

affiliated companies are leaders on the oil market in Bulgaria. Russia is the country‚Äôs main supplier
of crude oil because of the technological characteristics of the existing refinery in Bulgaria and the
characteristics of the oil it processes. Note that the physical properties and the exact chemical
composition of the crude oil vary depending on the location of the deposits. Therefore, oil refiners
are adapted to a certain type of oil and must undergo certain technological modification in order to
process other types of oil.
The output of Bulgaria‚Äôs only refinery is essential for the energy security and stability of the
country because of its market orientation. Despite the relatively small quantities of oil extracted on
its territory, the country‚Äôs market orientation is towards export of processed oil products. The
uninterrupted supply of oil from Russia is essential for Bulgaria and its energy security. Its importance
for the country‚Äôs oil industry is analysed in the following sections.
3.1. Primary production of oil products
Bulgaria‚Äôs deposits of oil and natural gas are insignificant and this is why the volume of its
primary production of oil products is extremely low and cannot meet the demand for such products
(see Figure 1).

Figure 1. Primary production of oil products in Bulgaria in the period 2005-2015 (in
thousand tonnes of oil equivalent (Ktoe))

During the period (2005 ‚Äì 2015) there was a steady downward trend in the production of oil
products until 2011, followed in 2012 and 2013 by an increase that may be defined as insignificant,
because the total volume of production increased only to 27.3 Ktoe.
3.2. Gross inland energy consumption
Bulgaria‚Äôs inland consumption of oil products consists mainly of consumption of fuels. This is
why GIEC3 remained high, fluctuating between 3 669 Ktoe and 4 956.3 Ktoe (see Figure 2) between
2005 and 2015. Consumption was decreasing until 2013, and then started to increase quite rapidly to
reach 3 879.5 Ktoe in 2014 and 4 200.8 Ktoe in 2015.

GIEC ‚Äì Gross Inland Energy Consumption

The comparative analysis of GIEC and PP4 for each year shows that the country relies heavily
on the import of oil products. The extremely low volumes of PP and the high levels of consumption
show extremely high levels of import dependence and corresponding levels of risk for the energy
security of the country.
3.3. Export
Export data show that the country exports large volumes of processed oil products (see Figure
3). Despite the low levels of primary production, the country specializes in the export of processed
oil products (mainly fuels). The difference between the PP volumes and the export volumes is
compensated with import of crude oil.
Figure 3. Bulgaria‚Äôs export of oil products in the period 2005-2015 (in thousand tonnes of
oil equivalent (Ktoe))

The export trend shows an increase in the exported quantities of oil products. The highest
volume was being reached in 2015 (4 481,2 Ktoe) and the lowest volume in the export values was
reported in 2005 (2605 Ktoe) and 2009 (3167.4 Ktoe). Despite this decline the trend remains growing.
The increasing in the export values in the case of Bulgaria is a prerequisite for increasing in the
quantities of the imports of oil products due to the low oil reserves.
3.4. Import
Taking into account the data for the PP, the GIEC and the export volumes, the volumes of import
are predictably high because they have to cover the difference between the PP on the one hand, and the
GIEC and the export of oil product, on the other. Imports peaked in 2015 at 8 732.3 Ktoe (see Figure 4).

According to the reported data, imports declined in two of the years within the analysed period
‚Äì in 2005 (7548.1 Ktoe) and in 2011 (7 219.6 Ktoe.) The highest volume of imported oil products
(8 732.3 Ktoe) was reported in 2015. The analysis of the import volumes shows that there is a trend
of their increasing steadily over the period. Although rate of increase is categorized as moderate, the
level of import volumes poses a risk for the energy security of the country.
4. Empirical research results
This section presents the results from the empirical study. The analysis shows an interesting trend

The results in the above table show that Bulgaria is highly dependent on its import of oil
products with dependence levels reaching values of over 235% over the consumption in 2013. On the
surface such large volumes of import may seem illogical and unjustified. However, they are justified
by Bulgaria‚Äôs orientation on the market of oil products. Despite its limited sources of oil, the country
imports large volumes of crude oil products which are processed and exported as fuels.
The curve of the import of oil products peaked in 2013 and then went down again (Figure 5.)
The increase of import dependence while the consumption is decreasing (Figure 5) is due to the
increase of the exported volumes of processed fuels.

Although import dependence itself poses a risk for Bulgaria‚Äôs energy security, this risk can be
mitigated to levels that do not jeopardize the country‚Äôs economy by means of diversification of its
suppliers and supply. Note that these two terms are markedly different. From a theoretical point of
view, in the presence of a large number of suppliers, there will be an almost symmetrical distribution
of supply, which indicates a high diversity of supply. In this case, the risk has values that assign our
country to the group of the countries with low dependency on supplier countries.
There is another scenario as well, in which the number of suppliers is also large, but the bulk
of the import is concentrated in one or a few large importers and the other suppliers import
insignificant or supplementary volumes. In this scenario, the risk for the country's energy security
increases significantly. Depending on the degree of concentration of imports, the country can be
placed in a situation that makes it highly vulnerable to suppliers of oil products.
The result of the research show that the number of Bulgaria‚Äôs suppliers of oil products varies
between 24 (in 2012) and 32 (in 2015.) This means that the level of diversification of suppliers of oil
products is good. Therefore, the country‚Äôs risk exposure should be defined by analysing its import

concentration, i.e. the diversification of supply. Bulgaria‚Äôs Herfindahl‚ÄìHirschman index varies
between 0.367 (in 2007) and 0.647 (in 2012.). According to the rating scale of the International
Energy Agency (InternatIonal Energy Agency 2011) these values rank as medium import
diversification. The closer to 1 are the values if the index, the greater is the exposure to energy security
risk of the country that imports the product. A high risk exposure means a higher dependence of the
country on its suppliers. In this respect Bulgaria‚Äôs risk exposure is relatively high, since about 77%
of its oil products are imported by one supplier - Russia.
The high concentration of supply in terms of a single major supplier is a prerequisite for
increasing both the energy and the economic risk for Bulgaria. Given the degree of energy dependence
on Russia and the fact that it is a major supplier of oil to the Bulgarian refinery, we may conclude
that our energy sector is highly vulnerable to external factors. Given the small quantities of oil
extracted in the country, the disruption of supply would have a negative impact on consumption as
well as the country's export of processed oil products. Accordingly, this would have a serious negative
impact on the country's economic stability.
The high dependence on imported oil increases Bulgaria's susceptibility to foreign political and
geopolitical pressure. The low degree of external resistance to such pressure poses serious risks for
the country and all sectors of its economy in terms of pressure for adoptions of policies that are not
in the best interest of the state. The pursuit of a policy contrary to the interests of the state is likely to
generate negative effects on the sustainable development of the country's economy.
The above analysis shows that energy dependence is one of the key factors for determining the
country's energy security and economic stability because the conditions of the energy sector affects
all other sectors of our economy. At high levels of energy dependence, the risk can be mitigated to
levels that do not jeopardize the country's energy security through diversification. Note that in order
to mitigate the energy risk we need not only diversification of the suppliers, but also diversification
of supplies. In some cases, as is the case with Bulgaria, the level of diversification of suppliers may
satisfactory, but the supply of a certain commodity may be concentrated in one or a few major
suppliers while the rest import insignificant or complementary quantities. Diversification of suppliers
is a misleading indicator because it may inadvertently conceal the presence of concentration of
supplies. This in turn generates a hidden risk for the country. Due to the fact that the latter may remain
covert, it may have a strong negative impact on the country's economy and its degree and importance
may prove to be serious.

Conclusions
The research analysed the effects of energy dependence and import structure on Bulgaria‚Äôs
energy security. The dependence was determined by calculating the ratio of energy dependence on
the import of oil products to the consumption of such products in the period 2005 - 2015. Import
structure was analysed using the number of suppliers and the degree of diversification in terms of the
Herfindahl‚ÄìHirschman‚Äôs index.
The results of this research show that Bulgaria is heavily dependent on imports of oil products,
with the percentage of its dependence reaching levels that are twice as high as its consumption of
such products. There are two reasons for this situation ‚Äì the lack of significant oil deposits on the
territory of the country and the fact that Bulgaria exports large amounts of the imported oil product
as processed fuels.
The analysis of the diversification of suppliers and the diversification of supply shows that
despite the large number of suppliers of oil products, the import structure is not diversified
sufficiently. This means that import is concentrated in one or a few large importers while the other
suppliers import insignificant or supplementary volumes of oil products. This import structure places
Bulgaria in a vulnerable position as it depends on just one main supplier, which poses a significant
risk for the energy security of the country. Taking into account the degree of dependence on the
import of oil products as well, we may conclude that Bulgaria is exposed to a significant energy
security risk in terms of its import of oil products ‚Äì a situation that calls for a careful risk management
and re-considering of the import structure.

Introduction
In recent years the issues of energy security and energy dependence have been subject to heated
debates due to their importance for the normal development and functioning of national economies.
It is an undeniable fact that in the twenty-first century the energy sec-tor affects both the everyday
lives of the ordinary people and the industry to such an extent that economies cannot exist without
such a sector. The importance of the energy sector makes all countries consider the issues of their
energy security and the reliability of their energy supply.
Bulgaria does not have significant sources of oil or natural gas in its territory. This is why it has
to meet its energy needs by importing energy from other countries. The continual import spins the
country in the spiral of energy dependence on the import of oil products, which negatively affects its
economy. The high dependence levels affect the overall economic stability of the country as well.
This research aims to determine the effects of the import of oil products and the degree of
diversification of energy supplies and suppliers for Bulgaria‚Äôs national economy by analysing the
factors that have negative effects on the energy security of the country.

1. Literature review
1.1. Energy security context
The topic of national energy security has been the focus of attention of many scholars for quite
a while. Numerous research studies in this field have shown that it is a topical and complex issue of
indisputable importance. The importance of energy security for each country is different and depends
on the role of the state in the trade process (M√ºller-Kraenner, 2007). Exporting countries consider
their energy security in terms of exporting their products on markets with good prices and minimal
risk exposures. Importing countries consider their energy security in terms of reliable supplies at
reasonable prices.
In his research Alhajji (5 November 2007) notes that governments often consider the energy
security concept only in terms of oil products. This fact is not surprising, because oil products are a
key resource for energy importers. This is why oil products have been a priority factor in defining
energy security policies for a long time. Besides, most of the energy security literature is concerned
exclusively with oil products (Fried and Trezise 1993; Stringer, 2008) since these products play the
most important role in the global economy and trade (Noreng, 2002).
1.2. Import dependence context
Energy dependence is usually considered the main factor that defines the level of risk for a
country‚Äôs energy security. Many authors relate energy security to energy dependence due to the
effect of this type of dependence on the security of the national economy. The research studies in

this field were carried out using various research methods. Such an ex-ample is the research of
Nicholas M. Odhiambo (2014), who studied energy security in the context of developing
countries‚Äô energy dependence using an Autoregressive Distributed-lag (ARDL) - bounds Testing
Approach. Kamonphorn Kanchanaa, Benjamin C. McLellan and Hironobu Unesak (2016)
analysed the international dimension of energy security by com-piling a composite energy
dependence indicator.
The core of this research is based on the model adopted by the International Energy Agency
(International Energy Agency, 2011) to evaluate energy security risks using a wide range of
indicators. Indicators of key importance are the energy dependence and the diversity of suppliers,
which is calculated using Herfindahl-Hirschman index, which is a measure of the concentration of
supply. Our research is based on the same methodology for calculating these two indicators in order
to determine their effect for Bulgaria‚Äôs energy security.
2. Research methodology
This research is focused mainly on Bulgaria‚Äôs dependence on the import of oil products and its
effect on the energy security of the country. The empirical analysis comprises two distinct stages - an
analysis of Bulgaria‚Äôs dependence on the import of oil products, followed by a study of the
diversification of suppliers and supplies. It aims to determine the degree of the country‚Äôs energy
dependence and import structure and their effect on Bulgaria‚Äôs energy dependence over a period of
ten years from 2005 to 2015.
Methods for evaluation of the energy dependency
Energy dependency is evaluated using the methodology adopted by Eurostat. It is based on the
ratio of the import of oil products to the gross inland consumption. This ratio shows the country‚Äôs
degree of dependency on imports to meet its inland consumption. The result is expressed as a
percentage that shows the share of import in the inland consumption and is calculated using the
following equation:
ID = (ùêºùëöùëùùëúùëüùë°/ùê∫ùêºùê∏ùê∂) √ó 100
(1)
where:
ID is import dependence

Imports ‚Äì the volume of imported oil products
GIEC- Gross Inland Energy Consumption of Oil Products
Diversification index ‚Äì methodology
In this part of the study we analysed the structure of import in terms of the existing
diversification of suppliers and supplies. The diversity of suppliers is calculated based on the number
of suppliers for the corresponding year. The diversity of supplies is calculated using the Herfindahl‚Äì
Hirschman index. This methodology is used by the International Energy Agency and is described in
a brochure for the MOSES model (InternatIonal Energy Agency 2011). The Herfindahl‚ÄìHirschman
index is a measure of the concentration of supply and the existence of monopolistic markets.
N

HHI = ‚àë si2
i=1

(2)
This index is calculated by squaring the market share of the import of each firm competing in
a market, and then summing the resulting numbers. Equation (2) can be expressed as:
HHI = s12 + s22 + s32 + ‚ãØ + sn2
(3)
where s is the market share of each firm.
There are two methods for calculating the market share and, respectively, for evaluating the
index. The first method calculates the market share of the companies as a whole number (a percentage
of the total market volume) and the squared percentage points are summed. When this method is used,
HHI may reach a maximum of 10 000 units. All values below 1000 units mean that the market is
highly diversified and a value of 10 000 means that there is a monopolistic market.
The second method uses market shares expressed as decimal fractions (rather than percentages)
and the index is the sum of their squares. In this case the index ranges between 0 and 1 (0< n <1),
where a value of 0 mean that the market is highly diversified and a value of 1 means that there is a
monopolistic market. The IEA categorizes the diversity of supplies based on the Herfindahl‚Äì
Hirschman index into three ranges: high diversity; medium diversity and low diversity (International
Energy Agency, 2011). According to this scale, all markets within the range of n<0.3 have high

diversity of supplies; those within the range of 0.3< n <0.8 have medium diversity of supplies and
those with indices exceeding 0.8 have low diversity of supplies.
For our research we used the second method for calculating the Herfindahl‚ÄìHirschman index,
which calculates the index using squared decimal fractions. Diversification is assessed using the scale
adopted by the International Energy Agency (IEA). The results from the analyses of the import
dependence, the number of suppliers and the Herfindahl‚ÄìHirschman‚Äôs index show the effect of these
factors on Bulgaria‚Äôs energy security.
3. Characteristics of Bulgaria‚Äôs Primary Production, Gross Inland Energy Consumption,
Import and Export of Oil Products
This section provides a review of the organization of the oil market and the four main indicators
related to Bulgaria‚Äôs production, consumption, import, and export of oil products. The aim of this
review is to give us a general idea of the importance of oil products as an element of Bulgaria‚Äôs energy
mix. The indicators are reviewed in the following order: (1) primary production (PP) of oil products;
(2) gross inland energy consumption (GIEC); (3) import; (4) export. First, however, we should
consider the specific characteristics of the market for crude oil and oil products in Bulgaria.
Unlike the natural gas and electricity markets, the crude oil market in the country is fully
liberalized. The companies operating on it are not owned or controlled by the state-owned Bulgarian
Energy Holding (BEH).1 Note that one of the biggest refineries on the Balkan Peninsula is located in
Bulgaria. According to information2 from the Ministry of Energy it is controlled with a majority stake
by the Russian company Lukoil (Ministry of Energy 2015).
LUKOIL Bulgaria EOOD and LUKOIL Neftohim Burgas AD also operate on the territory of
the country. Both companies are owned by the Russian company Lukoil. LUKOIL Bulgaria EOOD,
which owns the Rosenets port terminal and a refinery, is the biggest company in Bulgaria. According
to information published by the company itself, its contribution to the state budget is ¬º of the total
state budget revenue. The company is a major supplier and leader in the distribution of the fuels and
petrochemicals produced by LUKOIL Neftohim Burgas AD. The latter owns of a large chain of gas

Bulgarian Energy Holding EAD is a holding company that owns companies specialized in production and transmission
of electricity; transmission, transit and storage of natural gas, and lignite extraction. The Holding Group of BEH EAD
holds a key position on the natural gas and electricity market in Bulgaria as well as in the region due to its export of
electricity. The company is 100% owned by the Bulgarian state and is the largest state-owned company in the country in
terms of own assets. Its ownership rights are vested in the Minister of Energy.

stations on the territory of Bulgaria and has a large share of the market for fuels, petroleum products
and polymers both in Bulgaria and in the Central and Eastern European countries.
Other companies that operate on the oil and oil products market are:
ÔÇ∑

PETROL AD - a private company, which is the leader in the distribution of fuels in the country.
It owns more than 500 gas stations, 80 oil bases and three port terminals for petroleum products.

ÔÇ∑

PRISTA OIL AD - Bulgaria - the company is part of PRISTA OIL Group, which owns
subsidiaries all over Europe and deals with production, distribution, sale and marketing of oils,
greases, brake fluids and other oil products.

ÔÇ∑

NIS PETROL EOOD, owned by Neftena Industria Serbia (NIS) - one of the largest oil companies
in Southeastern Europe. Note that its majority shareholder (with a majority stake of 56.6% of its
equity) is the Russian company Gazprom Neft. In Bulgaria the company operates under the brand
"Gazprom" and owns a number of gas stations under the same brand (Ministy of Energy, 2016).
The market structure described above leads to the conclusion that the Russian Lukoil and its

affiliated companies are leaders on the oil market in Bulgaria. Russia is the country‚Äôs main supplier
of crude oil because of the technological characteristics of the existing refinery in Bulgaria and the
characteristics of the oil it processes. Note that the physical properties and the exact chemical
composition of the crude oil vary depending on the location of the deposits. Therefore, oil refiners
are adapted to a certain type of oil and must undergo certain technological modification in order to
process other types of oil.
The output of Bulgaria‚Äôs only refinery is essential for the energy security and stability of the
country because of its market orientation. Despite the relatively small quantities of oil extracted on
its territory, the country‚Äôs market orientation is towards export of processed oil products. The
uninterrupted supply of oil from Russia is essential for Bulgaria and its energy security. Its importance
for the country‚Äôs oil industry is analysed in the following sections.
3.1. Primary production of oil products
Bulgaria‚Äôs deposits of oil and natural gas are insignificant and this is why the volume of its
primary production of oil products is extremely low and cannot meet the demand for such products
(see Figure 1).

Figure 1. Primary production of oil products in Bulgaria in the period 2005-2015 (in
thousand tonnes of oil equivalent (Ktoe))

Source: Author‚Äôs representation using data from Eurostat database

During the period (2005 ‚Äì 2015) there was a steady downward trend in the production of oil
products until 2011, followed in 2012 and 2013 by an increase that may be defined as insignificant,
because the total volume of production increased only to 27.3 Ktoe.
3.2. Gross inland energy consumption
Bulgaria‚Äôs inland consumption of oil products consists mainly of consumption of fuels. This is
why GIEC3 remained high, fluctuating between 3 669 Ktoe and 4 956.3 Ktoe (see Figure 2) between
2005 and 2015. Consumption was decreasing until 2013, and then started to increase quite rapidly to
reach 3 879.5 Ktoe in 2014 and 4 200.8 Ktoe in 2015.

thousand tonnes of oil equivalent (Ktoe))

GIEC ‚Äì Gross Inland Energy Consumption

The comparative analysis of GIEC and PP4 for each year shows that the country relies heavily
on the import of oil products. The extremely low volumes of PP and the high levels of consumption
show extremely high levels of import dependence and corresponding levels of risk for the energy
security of the country.
3.3. Export
Export data show that the country exports large volumes of processed oil products (see Figure
3). Despite the low levels of primary production, the country specializes in the export of processed
oil products (mainly fuels). The difference between the PP volumes and the export volumes is
compensated with import of crude oil.
Figure 3. Bulgaria‚Äôs export of oil products in the period 2005-2015 (in thousand tonnes of
oil equivalent (Ktoe))

Source: Author‚Äôs representation using data from Eurostat database

The export trend shows an increase in the exported quantities of oil products. The highest
volume was being reached in 2015 (4 481,2 Ktoe) and the lowest volume in the export values was
reported in 2005 (2605 Ktoe) and 2009 (3167.4 Ktoe). Despite this decline the trend remains growing.
The increasing in the export values in the case of Bulgaria is a prerequisite for increasing in the
quantities of the imports of oil products due to the low oil reserves.
3.4. Import
Taking into account the data for the PP, the GIEC and the export volumes, the volumes of import
are predictably high because they have to cover the difference between the PP on the one hand, and the
GIEC and the export of oil product, on the other. Imports peaked in 2015 at 8 732.3 Ktoe (see Figure 4).

PP ‚Äì Primary Production
Figure 4. Bulgaria‚Äôs import of oil products in the period 2005-2015 (in thousand tonnes of

According to the reported data, imports declined in two of the years within the analysed period
‚Äì in 2005 (7548.1 Ktoe) and in 2011 (7 219.6 Ktoe.) The highest volume of imported oil products
(8 732.3 Ktoe) was reported in 2015. The analysis of the import volumes shows that there is a trend
of their increasing steadily over the period. Although rate of increase is categorized as moderate, the
level of import volumes poses a risk for the energy security of the country.
4. Empirical research results
This section presents the results from the empirical study. The analysis shows an interesting trend
in terms of the percentile import dependence and the directly proportional relation between the number
of suppliers of oil products and the diversification index. The results are shown in Table 1 below.

products with dependence levels reaching values of over 235% over the consumption in 2013. On the

Conclusions
The research analysed the effects of energy dependence and import structure on Bulgaria‚Äôs
energy security. The dependence was determined by calculating the ratio of energy dependence on
the import of oil products to the consumption of such products in the period 2005 - 2015. Import
structure was analysed using the number of suppliers and the degree of diversification in terms of the
Herfindahl‚ÄìHirschman‚Äôs index.
