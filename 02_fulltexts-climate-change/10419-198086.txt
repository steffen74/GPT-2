1. INTRODUCTION

There is a direct line between economic development and environment that causes changes to
the natural environment first through the utilization of natural resources and secondly through
pollution and the discharge of waste into the environment, as result of human activity. The changes
(some of them irreversible) of the ecological balance equally has drawn the attention of scientists,
politicians and society in general, who established the necessity to integrate all the efforts in the line
of preventing and removing the consequences of environmental pollution, together with a
rationalization of the resource consumption. Therefore, the concept of sustainable development
emerges as a reaction to the environmental threats which bring serious hazards in regard to the
human wellbeing. Because the destruction of the environment could affect our existence to its
deepest roots, sustainable development is forced to handle the problem of non-declining per capita
utility (Neumayer, 1999) through a complex approach who includes economic, social, political and
ecological aspects, promoting harmonious linkages between economic development, social equity,
efficient usage of the natural resources and the environmental preservation.

environmentalists, philosophers and politicians, being thus a real presence in the academic world as
well as in politics; unfortunately, since a few decades ago, the idea has been trapped in a theoretical
world and its practicality being enhanced only recently.
Therefore, the concept of sustainable development tends to lie in the „three spheres‟ (Little
and Green, 2009) of environment, society and economy, and all the issues such as climate change,
rapid depletion of natural resources, population growth and consequently the risk of increasing
poverty, involve two or more of these spheres.
This paper will present a brief history regarding the emergence of sustainable development
along with the most important moments in defining and applying the concept‟s objectives and in the
second part, will try to argue why education, through its ability to form human capital, is the best
way of moving society to a sustainable future.

1.

THE MALTHUSIAN NIGHTMARE

The debates regarding environmental issues and human wellbeing has marked the economic
philosophy for almost two centuries, beginning with Thomas Robert Malthus, a first line
representative of classic economists. In his Essay on the Principle of Population, he drew the
attention to the fact that „the population, when unchecked, increases in a geometrical ratio and
subsistence for man in an arithmetical ratio‟ (Rogers, 2008, p. 20), and from this perspective, he
pointed out that the power of population is indefinitely greater than the power of the earth to
produce subsistence for man. With this assumptions, Malthus rang the „alarm bells‟ for the first
time and cut loose to a great debate which has concerned the minds of man for almost two hundred
years, known today as the Malthusian catastrophe or nightmare. In the same way, through the voice
of David Ricardo, also a classical economist appears the idea that „economic growth must come to
an end, sooner or later, due to scarcity of natural resources‟ (Stoica, 2005, p. 8).
In fact, technological advancement and industrialization of agriculture have improved farmers
techniques, thereby „production has increased much more rapidly than population, so much so that
in real terms, the price of food is much lower today than it was two hundred years ago‟ (Baumol,
Litan, Schramm, 2007, p. 20), proving the limits of traditional Malthusian theory. However, the
debates about this theory has continued through time, with many critics wondering how it is
possible that with an increase in population size up to six billion, the humankind still manages to
feed itself.
The next Malthusian moment is represented by the ideas postulated by the Club of Rome. The
results of the researches made by The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), published in
the optimistic views, forcing the humankind to be aware that the problems given by economic
growth are inseparable from those of environmental pollution, population boom and the resource
depletion (Pohoaţă, 2003). According to this study, „population and industrial capital will continue
to grow exponentially, which leads to a similar growth in pollution and in demand for food and nonrenewable resources‟ (Cole, 2007, p. 241). Meadows argues that given the limited stock of nonrenewable resources and the non-declining demand for these could drive humanity to collapse into
the near future. Fortunately, as the time passed, „most if not all of the Club of Rome‟s predictions
for the next 30 years were not borne out‟ (Rogers, Jalal and Boyd, 2008, p. 20).
Last but not least, Lester Brown is shown to be another important representative of the
Malthusian theory. In 1974, Brown founded the World Watch Institute (the first research institute
devoted to the analysis of global environmental issues) and later on, in 2001, the Earth Policy
Institute, a nonprofit research organization. As Brown mentions, „both of them are presenting facts
regarding the global use of natural resources and also presenting viable alternatives for our
consumption trends‟ (Brown, 2006, p. 17). He is one of the world‟s most widely published authors
being one of the mainstream environmentalists, especially due to his book Plan B: Rescuing a
Planet under Stress and a Civilization in Trouble, published in 2003, which is considered to have
almost the same impact as the Cub of Rome‟s report.
Of course, many other names could find a place in this short review of the Malthusians, but it
is neither the place nor the purpose to offer an exhaustive description of them. Important for us is
the way they managed to provoke society to reflect even deeper on the dangers that may occur if
current consumption trends are maintained and if we do nothing to protect what we have.

AN INTERNATIONAL CONCERN FOR GLOBAL PROBLEMS AND THE

EMERGECE OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT

Beginning with the fact that all human activities affect the ecological balance, international
community has decided to handle the environmental problems by taking common actions at a global
scale, driven from the fact that, on the one hand the level of pollution and the imminent depletion of
the natural resources do not account for borders and on the other hand, that the gaps between
industrialized countries and the undeveloped states are increasingly profound.
Therefore, in 1972, in Stockholm, Sweden took place the International Conference on the
Human Environment. It was the first major conference on international environmental and
development issues. The meeting agreed upon a Declaration which contained 26 principles
concerning the environment and human development: an Action Plan for Human Environment with
Environmental management activities and International measures to support the national and
international actions of assessment and management) (Damian, 2007, p. 5). Another achievement of
the Stockholm Conference was the creation of the United Nations Environmental Program (UNEP)
that had the mission to „provide the leadership and encourage partnership in carrying for the
environment by inspiring, informing, and enabling nations and peoples to improve their quality of
life without compromising that of future generations‟ (UNEP Mission). However, the anticipated
impact of the Stockholm Conference was less than expected, especially because in some countries
environmental protection and the need for development represented two competing commitments,
therefore they were treated separately.
In 1983, the UN General Assembly created the World Commission on Environment and
Development which was later known as the Brundtland Commission, named after its Chairman,
Gro Harlem Brundtland, then Prime Minister of Norway and later head of the World Health
Organization. Four years later, the Commission published the Brundtland Report, entitled Our
Common Future. The report starts from what had been achieved at Stockholm and provides the
most politically significant of all definitions of sustainable development: „sustainable development
is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future
generations to meet their own needs‟ (Our Common Future, 1987, p. 24). Albert Bartlett argues in
an article regarding sustainable growth and population increase, published in 2006, that this
definition, coupled with the statement of the need to “sustain human progress into the distant
future”, is crucial for an understanding of the term sustainable development. Unfortunately, says
Bartlett, „the definition gives no hint regarding the courses of action that could be followed to meet
the needs of the present, but which, in doing so, would not limit the ability of generations,
throughout the distant future, to meet their own needs‟ (Bartlett, 2006, p. 21).
Despite all the critics and the controversies formed around the report, the concept of
sustainable development emerged, defining an important moment in the human confrontation with
poverty and environmental problems.
The Brundtland Report opened a way for the creation of the Agenda 21 and the principles of
the Rio Declaration at the UN Conference on the Environment and Development (UNCED) which
was held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, during the summer of 1992. This conference gathered 115 state
leaders, marking an unprecedented event, and on this occasion it was officially recognized, at a
global level, „the necessity of integrating economic development with environmental protection as
the main objective for sustainable development‟ (Damian, 2007, p. 7). The key results of the
Conference were: the Rio Declaration, the Agenda 21 and the Commission on Sustainable
Development. Moreover, most countries welcomed the idea and engaged in the implementation of
development.
Indeed, Rio de Janeiro is seen as the turning point in the history of sustainability dealing less
with theoretical approaches and concentrating more on finding the necessary actions for developing
local, national and global strategies for sustainable development.
The year 1997 marks another important moment in the sustainable development objective
implementation process through the Kyoto Conference on Climate Change. Leaders from 160
countries had then negotiated an agreement, known as the Kyoto Protocol, which aims to cut
emissions of greenhouse gases. The United States has proposed only a stabilization of emissions,
not their reduction, while the European Union insisted on a 15% cut of polluting gases. Finally, a
compromise was reached and the industrialized countries have committed themselves to an overall
reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases by 5.2% in 2008-2010 compared to the 1990 levels.
Kyoto targets were from the beginning very ambitious, which is why the United States refused to
ratify the Protocol invoking economic losses. The Protocol entered into force only on 16 February
2005 after its ratification by Russia (in November 2004), fulfilling thus the primary condition for its
implementation (the ratification of by 55 countries that produce 55% of global CO 2 emissions).
United Nations Summit on Sustainable Development held in Johannesburg in 2002
represented a milestone in creating partnerships between the UN, governments and
nongovernmental organizations, bringing together 104 heads of states from all over the world
(Damian, 2007, p. 8). Some authors believe that the summit was „a step in the movement concept
(sustainable development) in a more productive exploration of the relationship between economic
development and environmental quality‟ (Asefa, 2005, p. 1), reaffirming sustainable development
as a central element of the international agenda, by providing a new impetus for the introduction of
practical measures directed towards fighting global poverty and environmental protection.
Johannesburg Summit confirmed a trend that appeared at the Rio Conference in 1992, on the
growing importance of socio-economic pillars of sustainable development, reviewed the
Johannesburg Declaration.

THE ROLE OF EDUCATION IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF HUMAN

CAPITAL

Human resource is based on what we call the Human, who through all his actions is
contributing to his development and to human society as an integrative part. During the modern
history, all countries focused on the economic development in order to ensure the welfare and
human security.
young generation to give rise to a vision of sustainability that can offer a link between economic
progress, social welfare and respect for cultural diversity. By improving the access to quality
education, by reorienting existing education programs towards sustainable development, by
providing public information designed to draw attention to the risks that we all assume, from the
individual, community, society and ending at global scale, by promoting it at all levels of education,
whether formal or informal, highlighting the principles and values on which a sustainable society is
based, by promoting „lifelong learning‟ and the list goes on, we can make substantive changes
within the individual and social structure of the new generation, so that sacrifices made today are
for the benefit of tomorrow.
Wolfgang Lutz, Professor of Social and Economic Statistics at the Vienna University and
Leader of the World Population Program at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis
(IIASA) in Laxenburg, Austria, noted in an article published in 2009 that the answer to the
seductive question regarding what is the universal root that can causes desirable developments and
has the greatest long-term effect on human wellbeing for all cultures and subgroups of the world
population, is found in the mixture of education and health. To strengthen his assumption he
suggests a radical refocusing of international aid: „Empowering people through education rather
than corrupting them through money‟ (Lutz, 2009, p. 3).
Today, the present state of society requires a new way of development which integrates the
human dimension from another perspective (of complexity and diversity), in which education plays
an important role.
Therefore, the present society requires a new way of development or an alternative, which can
integrate the human dimension from another perspective - that of complexity and diversity. This
new approach imposed by the economic, social and political at the beginning of the XXI century,
cannot ignore education, the best gain for the individual and the community and cannot evade the
future and its impact on economic, technological, social, political, cultural aspects of the human
being.
From a temporal perspective, the role that education in general and economic education in
particular can play in the process of human development, is much more shaded and derives from a
different degree of involvement and exploitation of people's creative capacities, as well as from
their different ways to manifest demand for present and future welfare, aiming towards a new
quality of life, that can better reflect their needs and aspirations.
Knowledge has become the first component of human development in general and of the
economic one, in particular. Developed countries evolve rapidly on the coordinates of the
postindustrial economies which can be understood as knowledge economies. Taking into
new specific lifestyle of an open society. In this context, knowledge and information are the true
sources of power because through their consumption, they amplify, multiply and diversify. Unlike
other resources, knowledge is infinitely expandable, representing a virtually limitless resource for
economic development, which has not only been recognized as such, but it has been consistently
promoted by the powers of the world from whom progress can be achieved through performance,
creativity and imagination.
At this point it can be assumed, beyond any doubt, that education has an important positive
effect on economic growth, becoming an indispensible tool to sustainable development. No
economic development is possible without good education. Especially in the case of developing
countries with low human capital, a huge boost to economic sustainable growth can only be
achieved through large investments in education and the adoption of new technologies which
require more specialized work, or in other words more educated people.
Despite the present difficulties related to factors such as the lack of funding, lack of time, of
access to data, training, mentality, of a wide interdisciplinary research, performance indicators,
technical problems, etc., organized university research initiatives designed to support and facilitate
implementation of sustainability are present in the whole world and in this game European Union
plays a leading role through its policies meant to encourage the efforts made by member states for
creating a more strategic approach in terms of sharing knowledge and best practices to foster
education for sustainable development.

CONCLUSION

The philosophy of sustainability, which will concern open minds for a long time, approaches
both human and environmental condition, in its complexity and in all life aspects. Given the facts
that the Man not only can affect the environment but also can threaten his very own existence, this
perspective should offer us a starting point for some reflections regarding the running events
planned worldwide from 1972 until now. Looking back at these events, we can notice a shift of the
debate from environmental issues to the sustainable economy and society development and later, to
on poverty and quality of life, which brings out the multidimensional aspect of the concept. The
biggest challenge for sustainable development remains the uncertainty of the future and from this
particular reason it becomes imperative that future events – such as those presented in this paper –
must not neglect the global scale of the concept, since environmental hazard does not know borders.
Our most important resource (Human Capital) is found in abundance, and it can be trained
through education. In his statement regarding the principle of education, Kant said that „children
that is, in a manner which is adapted to the idea of humanity and the whole destiny of man‟ (Kant,
1900, p. 14).

environmentalists, philosophers and politicians, being thus a real presence in the academic world as

Therefore, the concept of sustainable development tends to lie in the „three spheres‟ (Little

rapid depletion of natural resources, population growth and consequently the risk of increasing
poverty, involve two or more of these spheres.
This paper will present a brief history regarding the emergence of sustainable development
along with the most important moments in defining and applying the concept‟s objectives and in the
second part, will try to argue why education, through its ability to form human capital, is the best
way of moving society to a sustainable future.

THE MALTHUSIAN NIGHTMARE

The debates regarding environmental issues and human wellbeing has marked the economic
philosophy for almost two centuries, beginning with Thomas Robert Malthus, a first line
representative of classic economists. In his Essay on the Principle of Population, he drew the
attention to the fact that „the population, when unchecked, increases in a geometrical ratio and
subsistence for man in an arithmetical ratio‟ (Rogers, 2008, p. 20), and from this perspective, he
pointed out that the power of population is indefinitely greater than the power of the earth to
produce subsistence for man. With this assumptions, Malthus rang the „alarm bells‟ for the first
time and cut loose to a great debate which has concerned the minds of man for almost two hundred
years, known today as the Malthusian catastrophe or nightmare. In the same way, through the voice

In fact, technological advancement and industrialization of agriculture have improved farmers
techniques, thereby „production has increased much more rapidly than population, so much so that
in real terms, the price of food is much lower today than it was two hundred years ago‟ (Baumol,
Litan, Schramm, 2007, p. 20), proving the limits of traditional Malthusian theory. However, the
debates about this theory has continued through time, with many critics wondering how it is
possible that with an increase in population size up to six billion, the humankind still manages to

The next Malthusian moment is represented by the ideas postulated by the Club of Rome. The

being one of the mainstream environmentalists, especially due to his book Plan B: Rescuing a
Planet under Stress and a Civilization in Trouble, published in 2003, which is considered to have
almost the same impact as the Cub of Rome‟s report.
Of course, many other names could find a place in this short review of the Malthusians, but it
is neither the place nor the purpose to offer an exhaustive description of them. Important for us is
the way they managed to provoke society to reflect even deeper on the dangers that may occur if
current consumption trends are maintained and if we do nothing to protect what we have.

AN INTERNATIONAL CONCERN FOR GLOBAL PROBLEMS AND THE

EMERGECE OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT

Beginning with the fact that all human activities affect the ecological balance, international
community has decided to handle the environmental problems by taking common actions at a global
scale, driven from the fact that, on the one hand the level of pollution and the imminent depletion of
the natural resources do not account for borders and on the other hand, that the gaps between
industrialized countries and the undeveloped states are increasingly profound.
Therefore, in 1972, in Stockholm, Sweden took place the International Conference on the
Human Environment. It was the first major conference on international environmental and
development issues. The meeting agreed upon a Declaration which contained 26 principles
concerning the environment and human development: an Action Plan for Human Environment with
Environmental management activities and International measures to support the national and
international actions of assessment and management) (Damian, 2007, p. 5). Another achievement of
the Stockholm Conference was the creation of the United Nations Environmental Program (UNEP)
that had the mission to „provide the leadership and encourage partnership in carrying for the
environment by inspiring, informing, and enabling nations and peoples to improve their quality of
life without compromising that of future generations‟ (UNEP Mission). However, the anticipated
impact of the Stockholm Conference was less than expected, especially because in some countries
environmental protection and the need for development represented two competing commitments,
therefore they were treated separately.
In 1983, the UN General Assembly created the World Commission on Environment and
Development which was later known as the Brundtland Commission, named after its Chairman,
Gro Harlem Brundtland, then Prime Minister of Norway and later head of the World Health
Organization. Four years later, the Commission published the Brundtland Report, entitled Our
Common Future. The report starts from what had been achieved at Stockholm and provides the
most politically significant of all definitions of sustainable development: „sustainable development
is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future
generations to meet their own needs‟ (Our Common Future, 1987, p. 24). Albert Bartlett argues in
an article regarding sustainable growth and population increase, published in 2006, that this
definition, coupled with the statement of the need to “sustain human progress into the distant
future”, is crucial for an understanding of the term sustainable development. Unfortunately, says
Bartlett, „the definition gives no hint regarding the courses of action that could be followed to meet
the needs of the present, but which, in doing so, would not limit the ability of generations,
throughout the distant future, to meet their own needs‟ (Bartlett, 2006, p. 21).
Despite all the critics and the controversies formed around the report, the concept of
sustainable development emerged, defining an important moment in the human confrontation with
poverty and environmental problems.
The Brundtland Report opened a way for the creation of the Agenda 21 and the principles of
the Rio Declaration at the UN Conference on the Environment and Development (UNCED) which
was held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, during the summer of 1992. This conference gathered 115 state
leaders, marking an unprecedented event, and on this occasion it was officially recognized, at a
global level, „the necessity of integrating economic development with environmental protection as
the main objective for sustainable development‟ (Damian, 2007, p. 7). The key results of the
Conference were: the Rio Declaration, the Agenda 21 and the Commission on Sustainable
Development. Moreover, most countries welcomed the idea and engaged in the implementation of
development.
Indeed, Rio de Janeiro is seen as the turning point in the history of sustainability dealing less
with theoretical approaches and concentrating more on finding the necessary actions for developing
local, national and global strategies for sustainable development.
The year 1997 marks another important moment in the sustainable development objective
implementation process through the Kyoto Conference on Climate Change. Leaders from 160
countries had then negotiated an agreement, known as the Kyoto Protocol, which aims to cut
emissions of greenhouse gases. The United States has proposed only a stabilization of emissions,
not their reduction, while the European Union insisted on a 15% cut of polluting gases. Finally, a
compromise was reached and the industrialized countries have committed themselves to an overall
reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases by 5.2% in 2008-2010 compared to the 1990 levels.
Kyoto targets were from the beginning very ambitious, which is why the United States refused to
ratify the Protocol invoking economic losses. The Protocol entered into force only on 16 February
2005 after its ratification by Russia (in November 2004), fulfilling thus the primary condition for its
implementation (the ratification of by 55 countries that produce 55% of global CO 2 emissions).
United Nations Summit on Sustainable Development held in Johannesburg in 2002
represented a milestone in creating partnerships between the UN, governments and
nongovernmental organizations, bringing together 104 heads of states from all over the world
(Damian, 2007, p. 8). Some authors believe that the summit was „a step in the movement concept
(sustainable development) in a more productive exploration of the relationship between economic
development and environmental quality‟ (Asefa, 2005, p. 1), reaffirming sustainable development
as a central element of the international agenda, by providing a new impetus for the introduction of
practical measures directed towards fighting global poverty and environmental protection.
Johannesburg Summit confirmed a trend that appeared at the Rio Conference in 1992, on the
growing importance of socio-economic pillars of sustainable development, reviewed the
Johannesburg Declaration.

THE ROLE OF EDUCATION IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF HUMAN

CAPITAL

Human resource is based on what we call the Human, who through all his actions is
contributing to his development and to human society as an integrative part. During the modern
history, all countries focused on the economic development in order to ensure the welfare and
human security.
young generation to give rise to a vision of sustainability that can offer a link between economic
progress, social welfare and respect for cultural diversity. By improving the access to quality
education, by reorienting existing education programs towards sustainable development, by
providing public information designed to draw attention to the risks that we all assume, from the
individual, community, society and ending at global scale, by promoting it at all levels of education,
whether formal or informal, highlighting the principles and values on which a sustainable society is
based, by promoting „lifelong learning‟ and the list goes on, we can make substantive changes
within the individual and social structure of the new generation, so that sacrifices made today are
for the benefit of tomorrow.
Wolfgang Lutz, Professor of Social and Economic Statistics at the Vienna University and
Leader of the World Population Program at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis
(IIASA) in Laxenburg, Austria, noted in an article published in 2009 that the answer to the
seductive question regarding what is the universal root that can causes desirable developments and
has the greatest long-term effect on human wellbeing for all cultures and subgroups of the world
population, is found in the mixture of education and health. To strengthen his assumption he
suggests a radical refocusing of international aid: „Empowering people through education rather
than corrupting them through money‟ (Lutz, 2009, p. 3).
Today, the present state of society requires a new way of development which integrates the
human dimension from another perspective (of complexity and diversity), in which education plays
an important role.
Therefore, the present society requires a new way of development or an alternative, which can
integrate the human dimension from another perspective - that of complexity and diversity. This
new approach imposed by the economic, social and political at the beginning of the XXI century,
cannot ignore education, the best gain for the individual and the community and cannot evade the
future and its impact on economic, technological, social, political, cultural aspects of the human
being.
From a temporal perspective, the role that education in general and economic education in
particular can play in the process of human development, is much more shaded and derives from a
different degree of involvement and exploitation of people's creative capacities, as well as from
their different ways to manifest demand for present and future welfare, aiming towards a new
quality of life, that can better reflect their needs and aspirations.
Knowledge has become the first component of human development in general and of the
economic one, in particular. Developed countries evolve rapidly on the coordinates of the
postindustrial economies which can be understood as knowledge economies. Taking into
new specific lifestyle of an open society. In this context, knowledge and information are the true
sources of power because through their consumption, they amplify, multiply and diversify. Unlike
other resources, knowledge is infinitely expandable, representing a virtually limitless resource for
economic development, which has not only been recognized as such, but it has been consistently
promoted by the powers of the world from whom progress can be achieved through performance,
creativity and imagination.
At this point it can be assumed, beyond any doubt, that education has an important positive
effect on economic growth, becoming an indispensible tool to sustainable development. No
economic development is possible without good education. Especially in the case of developing
countries with low human capital, a huge boost to economic sustainable growth can only be
achieved through large investments in education and the adoption of new technologies which
require more specialized work, or in other words more educated people.
Despite the present difficulties related to factors such as the lack of funding, lack of time, of
access to data, training, mentality, of a wide interdisciplinary research, performance indicators,
technical problems, etc., organized university research initiatives designed to support and facilitate
implementation of sustainability are present in the whole world and in this game European Union
plays a leading role through its policies meant to encourage the efforts made by member states for
creating a more strategic approach in terms of sharing knowledge and best practices to foster
education for sustainable development.

CONCLUSION

The philosophy of sustainability, which will concern open minds for a long time, approaches
both human and environmental condition, in its complexity and in all life aspects. Given the facts
that the Man not only can affect the environment but also can threaten his very own existence, this
perspective should offer us a starting point for some reflections regarding the running events
planned worldwide from 1972 until now. Looking back at these events, we can notice a shift of the
debate from environmental issues to the sustainable economy and society development and later, to
on poverty and quality of life, which brings out the multidimensional aspect of the concept. The
biggest challenge for sustainable development remains the uncertainty of the future and from this
particular reason it becomes imperative that future events – such as those presented in this paper –
must not neglect the global scale of the concept, since environmental hazard does not know borders.
Our most important resource (Human Capital) is found in abundance, and it can be trained
through education. In his statement regarding the principle of education, Kant said that „children
that is, in a manner which is adapted to the idea of humanity and the whole destiny of man‟ (Kant,
1900, p. 14).

1. INTRODUCTION

There is a direct line between economic development and environment that causes changes to
the natural environment first through the utilization of natural resources and secondly through
pollution and the discharge of waste into the environment, as result of human activity. The changes
(some of them irreversible) of the ecological balance equally has drawn the attention of scientists,
politicians and society in general, who established the necessity to integrate all the efforts in the line
of preventing and removing the consequences of environmental pollution, together with a
rationalization of the resource consumption. Therefore, the concept of sustainable development
emerges as a reaction to the environmental threats which bring serious hazards in regard to the
human wellbeing. Because the destruction of the environment could affect our existence to its
deepest roots, sustainable development is forced to handle the problem of non-declining per capita
utility (Neumayer, 1999) through a complex approach who includes economic, social, political and
ecological aspects, promoting harmonious linkages between economic development, social equity,
efficient usage of the natural resources and the environmental preservation.

environmentalists, philosophers and politicians, being thus a real presence in the academic world as
well as in politics; unfortunately, since a few decades ago, the idea has been trapped in a theoretical
world and its practicality being enhanced only recently.
Therefore, the concept of sustainable development tends to lie in the „three spheres‟ (Little
and Green, 2009) of environment, society and economy, and all the issues such as climate change,
rapid depletion of natural resources, population growth and consequently the risk of increasing
poverty, involve two or more of these spheres.
This paper will present a brief history regarding the emergence of sustainable development
along with the most important moments in defining and applying the concept‟s objectives and in the
second part, will try to argue why education, through its ability to form human capital, is the best
way of moving society to a sustainable future.

THE MALTHUSIAN NIGHTMARE

The debates regarding environmental issues and human wellbeing has marked the economic
philosophy for almost two centuries, beginning with Thomas Robert Malthus, a first line
representative of classic economists. In his Essay on the Principle of Population, he drew the
attention to the fact that „the population, when unchecked, increases in a geometrical ratio and
subsistence for man in an arithmetical ratio‟ (Rogers, 2008, p. 20), and from this perspective, he
pointed out that the power of population is indefinitely greater than the power of the earth to
produce subsistence for man. With this assumptions, Malthus rang the „alarm bells‟ for the first
time and cut loose to a great debate which has concerned the minds of man for almost two hundred
years, known today as the Malthusian catastrophe or nightmare. In the same way, through the voice
of David Ricardo, also a classical economist appears the idea that „economic growth must come to
an end, sooner or later, due to scarcity of natural resources‟ (Stoica, 2005, p. 8).
In fact, technological advancement and industrialization of agriculture have improved farmers
techniques, thereby „production has increased much more rapidly than population, so much so that
in real terms, the price of food is much lower today than it was two hundred years ago‟ (Baumol,
Litan, Schramm, 2007, p. 20), proving the limits of traditional Malthusian theory. However, the
debates about this theory has continued through time, with many critics wondering how it is
possible that with an increase in population size up to six billion, the humankind still manages to
feed itself.
The next Malthusian moment is represented by the ideas postulated by the Club of Rome. The
results of the researches made by The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), published in
the optimistic views, forcing the humankind to be aware that the problems given by economic
growth are inseparable from those of environmental pollution, population boom and the resource
depletion (Pohoaţă, 2003). According to this study, „population and industrial capital will continue
to grow exponentially, which leads to a similar growth in pollution and in demand for food and nonrenewable resources‟ (Cole, 2007, p. 241). Meadows argues that given the limited stock of nonrenewable resources and the non-declining demand for these could drive humanity to collapse into
the near future. Fortunately, as the time passed, „most if not all of the Club of Rome‟s predictions
for the next 30 years were not borne out‟ (Rogers, Jalal and Boyd, 2008, p. 20).
Last but not least, Lester Brown is shown to be another important representative of the
Malthusian theory. In 1974, Brown founded the World Watch Institute (the first research institute
devoted to the analysis of global environmental issues) and later on, in 2001, the Earth Policy
Institute, a nonprofit research organization. As Brown mentions, „both of them are presenting facts
regarding the global use of natural resources and also presenting viable alternatives for our
consumption trends‟ (Brown, 2006, p. 17). He is one of the world‟s most widely published authors
being one of the mainstream environmentalists, especially due to his book Plan B: Rescuing a
Planet under Stress and a Civilization in Trouble, published in 2003, which is considered to have
almost the same impact as the Cub of Rome‟s report.
Of course, many other names could find a place in this short review of the Malthusians, but it
is neither the place nor the purpose to offer an exhaustive description of them. Important for us is
the way they managed to provoke society to reflect even deeper on the dangers that may occur if
current consumption trends are maintained and if we do nothing to protect what we have.

AN INTERNATIONAL CONCERN FOR GLOBAL PROBLEMS AND THE

EMERGECE OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT

Beginning with the fact that all human activities affect the ecological balance, international
community has decided to handle the environmental problems by taking common actions at a global
scale, driven from the fact that, on the one hand the level of pollution and the imminent depletion of
the natural resources do not account for borders and on the other hand, that the gaps between
industrialized countries and the undeveloped states are increasingly profound.
Therefore, in 1972, in Stockholm, Sweden took place the International Conference on the
Human Environment. It was the first major conference on international environmental and
development issues. The meeting agreed upon a Declaration which contained 26 principles
concerning the environment and human development: an Action Plan for Human Environment with
Environmental management activities and International measures to support the national and
international actions of assessment and management) (Damian, 2007, p. 5). Another achievement of
the Stockholm Conference was the creation of the United Nations Environmental Program (UNEP)
that had the mission to „provide the leadership and encourage partnership in carrying for the
environment by inspiring, informing, and enabling nations and peoples to improve their quality of
life without compromising that of future generations‟ (UNEP Mission). However, the anticipated
impact of the Stockholm Conference was less than expected, especially because in some countries
environmental protection and the need for development represented two competing commitments,
therefore they were treated separately.
In 1983, the UN General Assembly created the World Commission on Environment and
Development which was later known as the Brundtland Commission, named after its Chairman,
Gro Harlem Brundtland, then Prime Minister of Norway and later head of the World Health
Organization. Four years later, the Commission published the Brundtland Report, entitled Our
Common Future. The report starts from what had been achieved at Stockholm and provides the
most politically significant of all definitions of sustainable development: „sustainable development
is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future
generations to meet their own needs‟ (Our Common Future, 1987, p. 24). Albert Bartlett argues in
an article regarding sustainable growth and population increase, published in 2006, that this
definition, coupled with the statement of the need to “sustain human progress into the distant
future”, is crucial for an understanding of the term sustainable development. Unfortunately, says
Bartlett, „the definition gives no hint regarding the courses of action that could be followed to meet
the needs of the present, but which, in doing so, would not limit the ability of generations,
throughout the distant future, to meet their own needs‟ (Bartlett, 2006, p. 21).
Despite all the critics and the controversies formed around the report, the concept of
sustainable development emerged, defining an important moment in the human confrontation with
poverty and environmental problems.
The Brundtland Report opened a way for the creation of the Agenda 21 and the principles of
the Rio Declaration at the UN Conference on the Environment and Development (UNCED) which
was held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, during the summer of 1992. This conference gathered 115 state
leaders, marking an unprecedented event, and on this occasion it was officially recognized, at a
global level, „the necessity of integrating economic development with environmental protection as
the main objective for sustainable development‟ (Damian, 2007, p. 7). The key results of the
Conference were: the Rio Declaration, the Agenda 21 and the Commission on Sustainable
Development. Moreover, most countries welcomed the idea and engaged in the implementation of
development.
Indeed, Rio de Janeiro is seen as the turning point in the history of sustainability dealing less
with theoretical approaches and concentrating more on finding the necessary actions for developing
local, national and global strategies for sustainable development.
The year 1997 marks another important moment in the sustainable development objective
implementation process through the Kyoto Conference on Climate Change. Leaders from 160
countries had then negotiated an agreement, known as the Kyoto Protocol, which aims to cut
emissions of greenhouse gases. The United States has proposed only a stabilization of emissions,
not their reduction, while the European Union insisted on a 15% cut of polluting gases. Finally, a
compromise was reached and the industrialized countries have committed themselves to an overall
reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases by 5.2% in 2008-2010 compared to the 1990 levels.
Kyoto targets were from the beginning very ambitious, which is why the United States refused to
ratify the Protocol invoking economic losses. The Protocol entered into force only on 16 February
2005 after its ratification by Russia (in November 2004), fulfilling thus the primary condition for its
implementation (the ratification of by 55 countries that produce 55% of global CO 2 emissions).
United Nations Summit on Sustainable Development held in Johannesburg in 2002
represented a milestone in creating partnerships between the UN, governments and
nongovernmental organizations, bringing together 104 heads of states from all over the world
(Damian, 2007, p. 8). Some authors believe that the summit was „a step in the movement concept
(sustainable development) in a more productive exploration of the relationship between economic
development and environmental quality‟ (Asefa, 2005, p. 1), reaffirming sustainable development
as a central element of the international agenda, by providing a new impetus for the introduction of
practical measures directed towards fighting global poverty and environmental protection.
Johannesburg Summit confirmed a trend that appeared at the Rio Conference in 1992, on the
growing importance of socio-economic pillars of sustainable development, reviewed the
Johannesburg Declaration.

THE ROLE OF EDUCATION IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF HUMAN

CAPITAL

Human resource is based on what we call the Human, who through all his actions is
contributing to his development and to human society as an integrative part. During the modern
history, all countries focused on the economic development in order to ensure the welfare and
human security.
young generation to give rise to a vision of sustainability that can offer a link between economic
progress, social welfare and respect for cultural diversity. By improving the access to quality
education, by reorienting existing education programs towards sustainable development, by
providing public information designed to draw attention to the risks that we all assume, from the
individual, community, society and ending at global scale, by promoting it at all levels of education,
whether formal or informal, highlighting the principles and values on which a sustainable society is
based, by promoting „lifelong learning‟ and the list goes on, we can make substantive changes
within the individual and social structure of the new generation, so that sacrifices made today are
for the benefit of tomorrow.
Wolfgang Lutz, Professor of Social and Economic Statistics at the Vienna University and
Leader of the World Population Program at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis
(IIASA) in Laxenburg, Austria, noted in an article published in 2009 that the answer to the
seductive question regarding what is the universal root that can causes desirable developments and
has the greatest long-term effect on human wellbeing for all cultures and subgroups of the world
population, is found in the mixture of education and health. To strengthen his assumption he
suggests a radical refocusing of international aid: „Empowering people through education rather
than corrupting them through money‟ (Lutz, 2009, p. 3).
Today, the present state of society requires a new way of development which integrates the
human dimension from another perspective (of complexity and diversity), in which education plays
an important role.
Therefore, the present society requires a new way of development or an alternative, which can
integrate the human dimension from another perspective - that of complexity and diversity. This
new approach imposed by the economic, social and political at the beginning of the XXI century,
cannot ignore education, the best gain for the individual and the community and cannot evade the
future and its impact on economic, technological, social, political, cultural aspects of the human
being.
From a temporal perspective, the role that education in general and economic education in
particular can play in the process of human development, is much more shaded and derives from a
different degree of involvement and exploitation of people's creative capacities, as well as from
their different ways to manifest demand for present and future welfare, aiming towards a new
quality of life, that can better reflect their needs and aspirations.
Knowledge has become the first component of human development in general and of the
economic one, in particular. Developed countries evolve rapidly on the coordinates of the
postindustrial economies which can be understood as knowledge economies. Taking into
new specific lifestyle of an open society. In this context, knowledge and information are the true
sources of power because through their consumption, they amplify, multiply and diversify. Unlike
other resources, knowledge is infinitely expandable, representing a virtually limitless resource for
economic development, which has not only been recognized as such, but it has been consistently
promoted by the powers of the world from whom progress can be achieved through performance,
creativity and imagination.
At this point it can be assumed, beyond any doubt, that education has an important positive
effect on economic growth, becoming an indispensible tool to sustainable development. No
economic development is possible without good education. Especially in the case of developing
countries with low human capital, a huge boost to economic sustainable growth can only be
achieved through large investments in education and the adoption of new technologies which
require more specialized work, or in other words more educated people.
Despite the present difficulties related to factors such as the lack of funding, lack of time, of
access to data, training, mentality, of a wide interdisciplinary research, performance indicators,
technical problems, etc., organized university research initiatives designed to support and facilitate
implementation of sustainability are present in the whole world and in this game European Union
plays a leading role through its policies meant to encourage the efforts made by member states for
creating a more strategic approach in terms of sharing knowledge and best practices to foster
education for sustainable development.

CONCLUSION

The philosophy of sustainability, which will concern open minds for a long time, approaches
both human and environmental condition, in its complexity and in all life aspects. Given the facts
that the Man not only can affect the environment but also can threaten his very own existence, this
perspective should offer us a starting point for some reflections regarding the running events
planned worldwide from 1972 until now. Looking back at these events, we can notice a shift of the
debate from environmental issues to the sustainable economy and society development and later, to
on poverty and quality of life, which brings out the multidimensional aspect of the concept. The
biggest challenge for sustainable development remains the uncertainty of the future and from this
particular reason it becomes imperative that future events – such as those presented in this paper –
must not neglect the global scale of the concept, since environmental hazard does not know borders.
Our most important resource (Human Capital) is found in abundance, and it can be trained
through education. In his statement regarding the principle of education, Kant said that „children
that is, in a manner which is adapted to the idea of humanity and the whole destiny of man‟ (Kant,
1900, p. 14).

Therefore, the concept of sustainable development tends to lie in the „three spheres‟ (Little

being one of the mainstream environmentalists, especially due to his book Plan B: Rescuing a
Planet under Stress and a Civilization in Trouble, published in 2003, which is considered to have
almost the same impact as the Cub of Rome‟s report.
Of course, many other names could find a place in this short review of the Malthusians, but it
is neither the place nor the purpose to offer an exhaustive description of them. Important for us is
the way they managed to provoke society to reflect even deeper on the dangers that may occur if
current consumption trends are maintained and if we do nothing to protect what we have.

AN INTERNATIONAL CONCERN FOR GLOBAL PROBLEMS AND THE

EMERGECE OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT

Beginning with the fact that all human activities affect the ecological balance, international
community has decided to handle the environmental problems by taking common actions at a global
scale, driven from the fact that, on the one hand the level of pollution and the imminent depletion of
the natural resources do not account for borders and on the other hand, that the gaps between
industrialized countries and the undeveloped states are increasingly profound.
Therefore, in 1972, in Stockholm, Sweden took place the International Conference on the
Human Environment. It was the first major conference on international environmental and
development issues. The meeting agreed upon a Declaration which contained 26 principles
concerning the environment and human development: an Action Plan for Human Environment with
Environmental management activities and International measures to support the national and
international actions of assessment and management) (Damian, 2007, p. 5). Another achievement of
the Stockholm Conference was the creation of the United Nations Environmental Program (UNEP)
that had the mission to „provide the leadership and encourage partnership in carrying for the
environment by inspiring, informing, and enabling nations and peoples to improve their quality of
life without compromising that of future generations‟ (UNEP Mission). However, the anticipated
impact of the Stockholm Conference was less than expected, especially because in some countries
environmental protection and the need for development represented two competing commitments,
therefore they were treated separately.
In 1983, the UN General Assembly created the World Commission on Environment and
Development which was later known as the Brundtland Commission, named after its Chairman,
Gro Harlem Brundtland, then Prime Minister of Norway and later head of the World Health
Organization. Four years later, the Commission published the Brundtland Report, entitled Our
Common Future. The report starts from what had been achieved at Stockholm and provides the
most politically significant of all definitions of sustainable development: „sustainable development
is development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future
generations to meet their own needs‟ (Our Common Future, 1987, p. 24). Albert Bartlett argues in
an article regarding sustainable growth and population increase, published in 2006, that this
definition, coupled with the statement of the need to “sustain human progress into the distant
future”, is crucial for an understanding of the term sustainable development. Unfortunately, says
Bartlett, „the definition gives no hint regarding the courses of action that could be followed to meet
the needs of the present, but which, in doing so, would not limit the ability of generations,
throughout the distant future, to meet their own needs‟ (Bartlett, 2006, p. 21).
Despite all the critics and the controversies formed around the report, the concept of
sustainable development emerged, defining an important moment in the human confrontation with
poverty and environmental problems.
The Brundtland Report opened a way for the creation of the Agenda 21 and the principles of
the Rio Declaration at the UN Conference on the Environment and Development (UNCED) which
was held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, during the summer of 1992. This conference gathered 115 state
leaders, marking an unprecedented event, and on this occasion it was officially recognized, at a
global level, „the necessity of integrating economic development with environmental protection as
the main objective for sustainable development‟ (Damian, 2007, p. 7). The key results of the
Conference were: the Rio Declaration, the Agenda 21 and the Commission on Sustainable
Development. Moreover, most countries welcomed the idea and engaged in the implementation of
development.
Indeed, Rio de Janeiro is seen as the turning point in the history of sustainability dealing less
with theoretical approaches and concentrating more on finding the necessary actions for developing
local, national and global strategies for sustainable development.
The year 1997 marks another important moment in the sustainable development objective
implementation process through the Kyoto Conference on Climate Change. Leaders from 160
countries had then negotiated an agreement, known as the Kyoto Protocol, which aims to cut
emissions of greenhouse gases. The United States has proposed only a stabilization of emissions,
not their reduction, while the European Union insisted on a 15% cut of polluting gases. Finally, a
compromise was reached and the industrialized countries have committed themselves to an overall
reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases by 5.2% in 2008-2010 compared to the 1990 levels.
Kyoto targets were from the beginning very ambitious, which is why the United States refused to
ratify the Protocol invoking economic losses. The Protocol entered into force only on 16 February
2005 after its ratification by Russia (in November 2004), fulfilling thus the primary condition for its
implementation (the ratification of by 55 countries that produce 55% of global CO 2 emissions).
United Nations Summit on Sustainable Development held in Johannesburg in 2002
represented a milestone in creating partnerships between the UN, governments and
nongovernmental organizations, bringing together 104 heads of states from all over the world
(Damian, 2007, p. 8). Some authors believe that the summit was „a step in the movement concept
(sustainable development) in a more productive exploration of the relationship between economic
development and environmental quality‟ (Asefa, 2005, p. 1), reaffirming sustainable development
as a central element of the international agenda, by providing a new impetus for the introduction of
practical measures directed towards fighting global poverty and environmental protection.
Johannesburg Summit confirmed a trend that appeared at the Rio Conference in 1992, on the
growing importance of socio-economic pillars of sustainable development, reviewed the
Johannesburg Declaration.

THE ROLE OF EDUCATION IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF HUMAN

CAPITAL

Human resource is based on what we call the Human, who through all his actions is
contributing to his development and to human society as an integrative part. During the modern
history, all countries focused on the economic development in order to ensure the welfare and
human security.
young generation to give rise to a vision of sustainability that can offer a link between economic
progress, social welfare and respect for cultural diversity. By improving the access to quality
education, by reorienting existing education programs towards sustainable development, by
providing public information designed to draw attention to the risks that we all assume, from the
individual, community, society and ending at global scale, by promoting it at all levels of education,
whether formal or informal, highlighting the principles and values on which a sustainable society is
based, by promoting „lifelong learning‟ and the list goes on, we can make substantive changes
within the individual and social structure of the new generation, so that sacrifices made today are
for the benefit of tomorrow.
Wolfgang Lutz, Professor of Social and Economic Statistics at the Vienna University and
Leader of the World Population Program at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis
(IIASA) in Laxenburg, Austria, noted in an article published in 2009 that the answer to the
seductive question regarding what is the universal root that can causes desirable developments and
has the greatest long-term effect on human wellbeing for all cultures and subgroups of the world
population, is found in the mixture of education and health. To strengthen his assumption he
suggests a radical refocusing of international aid: „Empowering people through education rather
than corrupting them through money‟ (Lutz, 2009, p. 3).
Today, the present state of society requires a new way of development which integrates the
human dimension from another perspective (of complexity and diversity), in which education plays
an important role.
Therefore, the present society requires a new way of development or an alternative, which can
integrate the human dimension from another perspective - that of complexity and diversity. This
new approach imposed by the economic, social and political at the beginning of the XXI century,
cannot ignore education, the best gain for the individual and the community and cannot evade the
future and its impact on economic, technological, social, political, cultural aspects of the human
being.
From a temporal perspective, the role that education in general and economic education in
particular can play in the process of human development, is much more shaded and derives from a
different degree of involvement and exploitation of people's creative capacities, as well as from
their different ways to manifest demand for present and future welfare, aiming towards a new
quality of life, that can better reflect their needs and aspirations.
Knowledge has become the first component of human development in general and of the
economic one, in particular. Developed countries evolve rapidly on the coordinates of the
postindustrial economies which can be understood as knowledge economies. Taking into
new specific lifestyle of an open society. In this context, knowledge and information are the true
sources of power because through their consumption, they amplify, multiply and diversify. Unlike
other resources, knowledge is infinitely expandable, representing a virtually limitless resource for
economic development, which has not only been recognized as such, but it has been consistently
promoted by the powers of the world from whom progress can be achieved through performance,
creativity and imagination.
At this point it can be assumed, beyond any doubt, that education has an important positive
effect on economic growth, becoming an indispensible tool to sustainable development. No
economic development is possible without good education. Especially in the case of developing
countries with low human capital, a huge boost to economic sustainable growth can only be
achieved through large investments in education and the adoption of new technologies which
require more specialized work, or in other words more educated people.
Despite the present difficulties related to factors such as the lack of funding, lack of time, of
access to data, training, mentality, of a wide interdisciplinary research, performance indicators,
technical problems, etc., organized university research initiatives designed to support and facilitate
implementation of sustainability are present in the whole world and in this game European Union
plays a leading role through its policies meant to encourage the efforts made by member states for
creating a more strategic approach in terms of sharing knowledge and best practices to foster
education for sustainable development.

CONCLUSION

The philosophy of sustainability, which will concern open minds for a long time, approaches
both human and environmental condition, in its complexity and in all life aspects. Given the facts
that the Man not only can affect the environment but also can threaten his very own existence, this
perspective should offer us a starting point for some reflections regarding the running events
planned worldwide from 1972 until now. Looking back at these events, we can notice a shift of the
debate from environmental issues to the sustainable economy and society development and later, to
on poverty and quality of life, which brings out the multidimensional aspect of the concept. The
biggest challenge for sustainable development remains the uncertainty of the future and from this
particular reason it becomes imperative that future events – such as those presented in this paper –
must not neglect the global scale of the concept, since environmental hazard does not know borders.
Our most important resource (Human Capital) is found in abundance, and it can be trained
through education. In his statement regarding the principle of education, Kant said that „children
that is, in a manner which is adapted to the idea of humanity and the whole destiny of man‟ (Kant,
1900, p. 14).
