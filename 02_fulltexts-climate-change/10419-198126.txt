Abstract: This article reflects the evolution of the social security system in Romania after accession to
the European Union. Social security states its specificity as a basic concept that encompasses all the collective
measures established by legislation to maintain individual or family income, to provide income when some or all
sources have been lost or exhausted or in cases where the individual must cope with increased expenses. From
this perspective, social security is a system that takes into account both the protection of able-bodied people (by
the social insurance system) and of those who cannot work or are socially disadvantaged. For Romania, the
social security system is currently profoundly affected due to the low ratio between the number of productive
Romanian citizens, contributors to the public budget and social funds, and the beneficiaries of these funds. The
study highlights this issue and focuses primarily on the effect produced on the social security compo nent by the
external labor migration, a phenomenon accentuated by Romania’s EU accession. Basically, Romania has
registered, according to Eurostat, only after 2007, more than 1 million migrants, most constituting the
economically active population, the phenomenon having a major impact on the sustainability of the social
security system.

INTRODUCTION

Social security is a means to protect its nationals by the State when faced with the risks induced
by various social adversities. The development of an adequate social security system, the configuration
and acceptance of a coherent legal and economic framework on this issue is an investment in “human
infrastructure”, just as important as the investment in the physical infrastructure.

influencing their development strategy. Every person and every family needs protection from the risks
and uncertainties resulting from everyday activities. When this need is not satisfied for the individual
and his family, the released effects have significant negative implications on the individual’s comfort,
his motivation to work and especially on the sustainability and functionality of economic systems.
From a conceptual standpoint, social security refers to both social insurance and social assistance.
Social security includes: health insurance, maternity benefits, death grants, unemployment
compensation, pension, insurance for work accidents and occupational diseases. In this format, the
pension system is the largest sequence that composes the social security system. The main issue raised
in most discussions concerning the characterization of pension systems has as leitmotiv the dichotomy
between PAYG type systems and fully funded type systems.
Typically, the public pension system is founded on the idea of pay-as-you-go (PAYG), i.e. the
current payment of pensions from contributions collected from the present income of the working
population. On the other hand, there are private pension systems based on the accumulation and
investment of individual savings, also called fully funded.
The existing pension systems differ considerably between countries mainly due to the specific
historical path of each. For example, in countries with a significant social ideological and economic
foundation, such as France and Germany, the PAYG type pension schemes are more present. In o ther
countries, like Britain and the United States, with a liberal or neoliberal economic point of view, the
emphasis is on fully funded type systems. These pension schemes can also work mixed. In fact, in most
states, the main pillar for the funding of the pension provision consists of a public pension plan,
mandatory, and completed by a private pension system, be it mandatory or optional.

1. CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM IN ROMANIA

Currently, in Romania operates, as a basic formula, a public pension system of a redistributive
type based on the solidarity between generations, i.e. a PAYG type system. It is also called Pillar I. To
the public pension system contribute all employees plus any other taxpayers forced by law to pay the
SSC (social security contributions). The social security contribution rates are approved by the state
social insurance budget law. They are differentiated depending on working conditions: normal,
particular and special. The amounts collected from the State Social Insurance Budget out of which

the one hand, by the employer, and secondly, by the employee.
All contributors receive a pension right, but the link between the amount of contributions paid
during the lifetime and the pension amount is not proportionate. All contributors accumulate a score
according to the amounts paid, and the pension calculated is the result of the product between the
number of points and the point value. A formula that is very relative, because the point value is
determined politically and therefore subject to the country’s political development and the economic
and doctrinal orientation of those in power. This is one of the major flaws of the PAYG type public
pension system operating now in Romania. Currently, to the public pension system contribute
approximately 4.1 million employees which support about 4.7 million pensioners. The pension
formulas applied in the post-socialist period hoping to solve the growing unemployment (including
early retirement) have considerably increased the number of retirees. Thus, between 1990 and 2010, the
number of pensioners increased by approximately 80%. The deeply unbalanced situation in which the
pension system is, based on the principle of social solidarity, specific to PAYG, is reflected in the
increased rate of dependency between the number of pensioners and number of employees and the
upward direction in which it evolved between 1991 and 2010.
The ratio of employees and beneficiaries of state social insurance pension for the period 19912010 reflects the following situation:

In addition to pensions paid from the state social security budget, in Romania works the pension
system for farmers, different from the public system, not-contributory, which is supported which is
supported by resources from the state budget and providing retirement benefits for about 760,000
former farm workers. Then there are the special pensions of former employees of the defense system,
which had a special contribution scheme and we also mention other types of pensions such as those of
diplomats, judges, parliamentarians, etc. Also in the case of the latter the contributions scheme had a
special character.
A major challenge in terms of the reconfiguration of the pension system is the introduction of 2 nd
pillar, mandatory, of the fully funded type. In 2007, two pillars that match the private pension system
were introduced: the 2nd pillar (regulated by Law 411/2004) and the 3 rd pillar (regulated by Law
204/2006). The 2nd pillar is binding on all persons up to the age of 35. The contribution is voluntary for
those between 35 and 45 years. The 2 nd pillar represents the prefinanced component of the first pillar, a
part of the social security system contributions, being mandatorily directed towards pension funds
under private management. The contribution rate in the first year was 2% of the gross income, and will
reach a maximum of 6% by the end of 2016. For 2011, the contribution rate related to the private
pension funds is 3% (acc. to art. 17 paragraph [2] of Law no. 287/2010 on the state social insurance

rates were 31.3% (for normal working conditions), 36.3% (for particular working conditions) and
41.3% (for special working conditions). From this, the individual social security contribution rate is
10.5%, regardless of the working conditions. The evolution of the contribution rates for both
employees and employers for the period 1991-2009 is shown in the table below:

As noted, the individual social insurance contribution rate has evolved between 3% and 11.67%
for normal working conditions.

PENSIONERS. THE SCENARIOS METHOD USING THE AVERAGE GROSS EARNINGS
AND THE AVERAGE PENSION

The calculation made in this approach is a scenario based on average amounts collected annually
from individual contributions and employer contributions for normal working conditions, collections in
relation to average gross annual earnings and annual average pensions. Particular and special working
conditions have been disregarded, since these situations are less common.
The value of the contribution rate for each year for the period 1991 - 2009 has been taken as a
benchmark according to the data from the Ministry of Labor, Solidarity and Social Protection. For the
gross average earnings for each year of the period analyzed and the average monthly pension, the data
supplied by the National Institute of Statistics. Regarding the amounts collected, depending on
individual and employer contribution rates, having as base the average gross earnings for the period
1991-2009, the analysis revealed the following situation:

Thus, at an average pension of 233 dollars, with a total, in 2009, of 4.718 million pensioners
benefiting from state social insurance, the effort for supporting the m, taking as a basis for calculating
the average pension, is 13,201,054,668 dollars. Since 2009 marked only 4,367,700 employees (i.e.
contributors), which provide only 9,926,007,552 dollars in the form of social insurance, a major
discrepancy between the amount required to cover the pensions and the amounts collected by the state
social insurance system can be noticed.

3. IMPACT ON THE STATE SOCIAL INSURANCE BUDGET PRODUCED BY
MIGRATION FROM ROMANIA TO THE EUROPEAN UNION

The phenomenon of globalization has generated substantial movements in the international area,
among them being found in a significant proportion movement of persons, goods and capital. The
geopolitical and social context created following the fall of the Berlin Wall significantly shaped the
migration phenomenon, opening the possibility of movement of people mainly from Eastern Europe to
Western Europe. Freedom of movement gained by the citizens of Central and Eastern Europe after
1989 has allowed them to turn to other countries including for searching for jobs. The phenomenon,
somewhat timid at first because of the quite restrictive legislative conditionalities, accelerated once
with the enlargement of the European Union and liberalization of the labor market for all its citizens.
The continuous increase in the number of migrants allowed it to become an important phenomenon of
the current social reality. Currently, virtually all countries are involved in the comp lex process of
migration abroad, integrating in the general picture wither as countries of destination, either as
countries of origin or transit, and this makes migration to be one with multiple facets: economic, social
and political.

migration. The effect of this phenomenon is analyzed primarily through the impact on the social
security system component, deeply unbalanced by the major asymmetry between the number of
employees – thus of contributors – and the numbers of retirees. Article makes an analysis based on
existing statistical data at the level of specialized institutions such as the UN Population Fund, the
Ministry of Labor, Family and Social Protection, the National Institute of Statistics, Eurostat, OECD
etc.
From a conceptual point of view, the meaning of the terms used in this study referring to
migration is consistent with the general definitions established by the International Organization for
Migration. Thus, the concept of migration refers to movement of a person or a group of people outside
the community of residence, within a given reference period, in order to change domicile. From the
perspective of this study, migration is treated as one of the factors with the greatest impact on the
pension systems, the effects being obvious: lower share of contributions as a result of the reduction of
the number of contributors. Given the PAYG scheme financing of these pension programs (pension
system based on the principle of social solidarity, i.e. support by those who currently have an income of
those who worked in the past ), the tax burden is placed especially on employees and employers).
Research shows migration flows from Romania to the European Union. Data on migration flows
for the period 1991 to 2009 (this being the last year for which there is data ) were extracted from the
Eurostat. Where there were missing data, supplementing them was provided with data from
Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. The situation of departures from Romania
to the European Union for the period 1991-2009 is shown in the chart below:

http://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx

As seen from the data, consistent in the early 90s, migration falls on a downward route in the
period 1993-1997. We can note that the maximum moment in terms of migration was achieved in 2007,
therefore when Romania adhered to the European Union, which allowed for greater labor mobility.
Thus, in 2007 the total number of emigrants from Romania to the European Union was 555,797 people.
Based on the above data, the amount of state social contributions that would have been collected from
those who emigrated during the period 1991-2009 was calculated. The analysis is only a scenario that
assumes that all those who have emigrated are potentially economically active population. As such, due
to lack of evidence enabling an accurate quantification of migration for work abroad, we have used
data that reflect the total number of migrants (not only for work, but in general). In fact, a test applied
in Spain and Italy, countries that have attracted the largest number of Romanian migrants for the period
2005 - 2009 (period for which Eurostat provides data also on the age of migrants, from which it can be
deduced how many of the mass of migrants are potentially active population) shows that approximately
90% of the total migrants fall within the economically active population, aged between 15 and 65.
Thus, under the advanced scenario, if those who emigrated from Romania during 1991 - 2009
would have been contributors to the State Social Insurance Budget, the amounts with which they would
have contributed, according to the contribution rate established for the advanced period and according
to the average salary, would have been the following:

As shown in the table above, the hypothetical amounts that would have been collected from the
mass of Romanian emigrants, where they would have been in Romania and would have been enrolled
on the labor market are not at all insignificant.

CONCLUSIONS

The logic course of such calculations was to highlight the extent to which social insurance
contributions collected from those who emigrated from Romania, provided they would have acted in
the capacity of contributors, would have redrawn the state social insurance budget. As such, we have
aggregated the amounts collected from contributors registered in Romania to those which could have

Romania’s accession to the European Union, in that it has created new opportunities for labor
migration, heavily imbalanced the state social insurance budget. It is noted that the hypothetical
contribution of these would have been more than sufficient to ensure the sustainability of the Romanian
pension system. In fact, when the balance of income-expenditures is broken is when migration begins
an upward trend (2002 - 2003) and accentuates once with Romania’s accession to the European Union
in 2007.
The scenario considered in this approach does nothing else, beyond the mathematical calculation,
but to warn that the migration phenomenon, accentuated by Romania’s EU accession, has significant
implications on the social security component. The imbalance of social secur ity system is closely
linked to the economically active population trends. Calculations show that if state social insurance
contributions would have been collected from absolutely all Romanian emigrants the state social
insurance system in Romania would have been different. It should be recognized however that this
scenario has a number of limitations mostly due to the fact that not all migrants are economically active
population, on the other hand not all would have become employees, i.e. contributors, eve n if they
would have stayed in Romania.
However, we can conclude that, concerning the impact of emigration on the state social insurance
budget, this is a major cause of imbalances registered in the system. Also, we must point out that

also in terms of social assistance. For example, in 25 to 35 years, those who work illegally or not at all
(significant in number) will reach retirement age without being insured, and will burden the social
assistance system, claiming from public money the minimum guaranteed income or other forms of
social aid. At that time, the active age population (paying these costs through taxes and contributions to
insurance funds) will be less numerous, which will significantly increase taxes (World Bank 2009).
Romania’s accession to the European Union, produced in 2007, and the permanent process of
integration, the gradual liberalization of the labor market for Romanian citizens will increase the
dynamics of migration while at the same time will accentuate the imbalance on the social security
component.
In 2008, the European labor commissioner Vladimir Spidla said that the “Hidden economy
undermines the financing of social security systems, impedes the pursuit of coherent economic policies
and could lead to social dumping”. We might add that the phenomenon of migration, especially for
countries that face a downward trend of the volume of economically active population can produce the
same underfunding effect of social security systems.

Abstract: This article reflects the evolution of the social security system in Romania after accession to
the European Union. Social security states its specificity as a basic concept that encompasses all the collective
measures established by legislation to maintain individual or family income, to provide income when some or all
sources have been lost or exhausted or in cases where the individual must cope with increased expenses. From
this perspective, social security is a system that takes into account both the protection of able-bodied people (by
the social insurance system) and of those who cannot work or are socially disadvantaged. For Romania, the
social security system is currently profoundly affected due to the low ratio between the number of productive
Romanian citizens, contributors to the public budget and social funds, and the beneficiaries of these funds. The
study highlights this issue and focuses primarily on the effect produced on the social security compo nent by the
external labor migration, a phenomenon accentuated by Romania’s EU accession. Basically, Romania has
registered, according to Eurostat, only after 2007, more than 1 million migrants, most constituting the
economically active population, the phenomenon having a major impact on the sustainability of the social
security system.

INTRODUCTION

Social security is a means to protect its nationals by the State when faced with the risks induced
by various social adversities. The development of an adequate social security system, the configuration
and acceptance of a coherent legal and economic framework on this issue is an investment in “human
infrastructure”, just as important as the investment in the physical infrastructure.

influencing their development strategy. Every person and every family needs protection from the risks
and uncertainties resulting from everyday activities. When this need is not satisfied for the individual
and his family, the released effects have significant negative implications on the individual’s comfort,
his motivation to work and especially on the sustainability and functionality of economic systems.
From a conceptual standpoint, social security refers to both social insurance and social assistance.
Social security includes: health insurance, maternity benefits, death grants, unemployment
compensation, pension, insurance for work accidents and occupational diseases. In this format, the
pension system is the largest sequence that composes the social security system. The main issue raised
in most discussions concerning the characterization of pension systems has as leitmotiv the dichotomy
between PAYG type systems and fully funded type systems.
Typically, the public pension system is founded on the idea of pay-as-you-go (PAYG), i.e. the
current payment of pensions from contributions collected from the present income of the working
population. On the other hand, there are private pension systems based on the accumulation and
investment of individual savings, also called fully funded.
The existing pension systems differ considerably between countries mainly due to the specific
historical path of each. For example, in countries with a significant social ideological and economic
foundation, such as France and Germany, the PAYG type pension schemes are more present. In o ther
countries, like Britain and the United States, with a liberal or neoliberal economic point of view, the
emphasis is on fully funded type systems. These pension schemes can also work mixed. In fact, in most
states, the main pillar for the funding of the pension provision consists of a public pension plan,
mandatory, and completed by a private pension system, be it mandatory or optional.

1. CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM IN ROMANIA

Currently, in Romania operates, as a basic formula, a public pension system of a redistributive
type based on the solidarity between generations, i.e. a PAYG type system. It is also called Pillar I. To
the public pension system contribute all employees plus any other taxpayers forced by law to pay the
SSC (social security contributions). The social security contribution rates are approved by the state
social insurance budget law. They are differentiated depending on working conditions: normal,
particular and special. The amounts collected from the State Social Insurance Budget out of which

the one hand, by the employer, and secondly, by the employee.
All contributors receive a pension right, but the link between the amount of contributions paid
during the lifetime and the pension amount is not proportionate. All contributors accumulate a score
according to the amounts paid, and the pension calculated is the result of the product between the
number of points and the point value. A formula that is very relative, because the point value is
determined politically and therefore subject to the country’s political development and the economic
and doctrinal orientation of those in power. This is one of the major flaws of the PAYG type public
pension system operating now in Romania. Currently, to the public pension system contribute
approximately 4.1 million employees which support about 4.7 million pensioners. The pension
formulas applied in the post-socialist period hoping to solve the growing unemployment (including
early retirement) have considerably increased the number of retirees. Thus, between 1990 and 2010, the
number of pensioners increased by approximately 80%. The deeply unbalanced situation in which the
pension system is, based on the principle of social solidarity, specific to PAYG, is reflected in the
increased rate of dependency between the number of pensioners and number of employees and the
upward direction in which it evolved between 1991 and 2010.
The ratio of employees and beneficiaries of state social insurance pension for the period 19912010 reflects the following situation:

In addition to pensions paid from the state social security budget, in Romania works the pension
system for farmers, different from the public system, not-contributory, which is supported which is
supported by resources from the state budget and providing retirement benefits for about 760,000
former farm workers. Then there are the special pensions of former employees of the defense system,
which had a special contribution scheme and we also mention other types of pensions such as those of
diplomats, judges, parliamentarians, etc. Also in the case of the latter the contributions scheme had a
special character.
A major challenge in terms of the reconfiguration of the pension system is the introduction of 2 nd
pillar, mandatory, of the fully funded type. In 2007, two pillars that match the private pension system
were introduced: the 2nd pillar (regulated by Law 411/2004) and the 3 rd pillar (regulated by Law
204/2006). The 2nd pillar is binding on all persons up to the age of 35. The contribution is voluntary for
those between 35 and 45 years. The 2 nd pillar represents the prefinanced component of the first pillar, a
part of the social security system contributions, being mandatorily directed towards pension funds
under private management. The contribution rate in the first year was 2% of the gross income, and will
reach a maximum of 6% by the end of 2016. For 2011, the contribution rate related to the private
pension funds is 3% (acc. to art. 17 paragraph [2] of Law no. 287/2010 on the state social insurance

rates were 31.3% (for normal working conditions), 36.3% (for particular working conditions) and
41.3% (for special working conditions). From this, the individual social security contribution rate is
10.5%, regardless of the working conditions. The evolution of the contribution rates for both
employees and employers for the period 1991-2009 is shown in the table below:

As noted, the individual social insurance contribution rate has evolved between 3% and 11.67%
for normal working conditions.

PENSIONERS. THE SCENARIOS METHOD USING THE AVERAGE GROSS EARNINGS
AND THE AVERAGE PENSION

The calculation made in this approach is a scenario based on average amounts collected annually
from individual contributions and employer contributions for normal working conditions, collections in
relation to average gross annual earnings and annual average pensions. Particular and special working
conditions have been disregarded, since these situations are less common.
The value of the contribution rate for each year for the period 1991 - 2009 has been taken as a
benchmark according to the data from the Ministry of Labor, Solidarity and Social Protection. For the
gross average earnings for each year of the period analyzed and the average monthly pension, the data
supplied by the National Institute of Statistics. Regarding the amounts collected, depending on
individual and employer contribution rates, having as base the average gross earnings for the period
1991-2009, the analysis revealed the following situation:

Thus, at an average pension of 233 dollars, with a total, in 2009, of 4.718 million pensioners
benefiting from state social insurance, the effort for supporting the m, taking as a basis for calculating
the average pension, is 13,201,054,668 dollars. Since 2009 marked only 4,367,700 employees (i.e.
contributors), which provide only 9,926,007,552 dollars in the form of social insurance, a major
discrepancy between the amount required to cover the pensions and the amounts collected by the state
social insurance system can be noticed.

3. IMPACT ON THE STATE SOCIAL INSURANCE BUDGET PRODUCED BY
MIGRATION FROM ROMANIA TO THE EUROPEAN UNION

The phenomenon of globalization has generated substantial movements in the international area,
among them being found in a significant proportion movement of persons, goods and capital. The
geopolitical and social context created following the fall of the Berlin Wall significantly shaped the
migration phenomenon, opening the possibility of movement of people mainly from Eastern Europe to
Western Europe. Freedom of movement gained by the citizens of Central and Eastern Europe after
1989 has allowed them to turn to other countries including for searching for jobs. The phenomenon,
somewhat timid at first because of the quite restrictive legislative conditionalities, accelerated once
with the enlargement of the European Union and liberalization of the labor market for all its citizens.
The continuous increase in the number of migrants allowed it to become an important phenomenon of
the current social reality. Currently, virtually all countries are involved in the comp lex process of
migration abroad, integrating in the general picture wither as countries of destination, either as
countries of origin or transit, and this makes migration to be one with multiple facets: economic, social
and political.

migration. The effect of this phenomenon is analyzed primarily through the impact on the social
security system component, deeply unbalanced by the major asymmetry between the number of
employees – thus of contributors – and the numbers of retirees. Article makes an analysis based on
existing statistical data at the level of specialized institutions such as the UN Population Fund, the
Ministry of Labor, Family and Social Protection, the National Institute of Statistics, Eurostat, OECD
etc.
From a conceptual point of view, the meaning of the terms used in this study referring to
migration is consistent with the general definitions established by the International Organization for
Migration. Thus, the concept of migration refers to movement of a person or a group of people outside
the community of residence, within a given reference period, in order to change domicile. From the
perspective of this study, migration is treated as one of the factors with the greatest impact on the
pension systems, the effects being obvious: lower share of contributions as a result of the reduction of
the number of contributors. Given the PAYG scheme financing of these pension programs (pension
system based on the principle of social solidarity, i.e. support by those who currently have an income of
those who worked in the past ), the tax burden is placed especially on employees and employers).
Research shows migration flows from Romania to the European Union. Data on migration flows
for the period 1991 to 2009 (this being the last year for which there is data ) were extracted from the
Eurostat. Where there were missing data, supplementing them was provided with data from
Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. The situation of departures from Romania
to the European Union for the period 1991-2009 is shown in the chart below:

http://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx

As seen from the data, consistent in the early 90s, migration falls on a downward route in the
period 1993-1997. We can note that the maximum moment in terms of migration was achieved in 2007,
therefore when Romania adhered to the European Union, which allowed for greater labor mobility.
Thus, in 2007 the total number of emigrants from Romania to the European Union was 555,797 people.
Based on the above data, the amount of state social contributions that would have been collected from
those who emigrated during the period 1991-2009 was calculated. The analysis is only a scenario that
assumes that all those who have emigrated are potentially economically active population. As such, due
to lack of evidence enabling an accurate quantification of migration for work abroad, we have used
data that reflect the total number of migrants (not only for work, but in general). In fact, a test applied
in Spain and Italy, countries that have attracted the largest number of Romanian migrants for the period
2005 - 2009 (period for which Eurostat provides data also on the age of migrants, from which it can be
deduced how many of the mass of migrants are potentially active population) shows that approximately
90% of the total migrants fall within the economically active population, aged between 15 and 65.
Thus, under the advanced scenario, if those who emigrated from Romania during 1991 - 2009
would have been contributors to the State Social Insurance Budget, the amounts with which they would
have contributed, according to the contribution rate established for the advanced period and according
to the average salary, would have been the following:

As shown in the table above, the hypothetical amounts that would have been collected from the
mass of Romanian emigrants, where they would have been in Romania and would have been enrolled
on the labor market are not at all insignificant.

CONCLUSIONS

The logic course of such calculations was to highlight the extent to which social insurance
contributions collected from those who emigrated from Romania, provided they would have acted in
the capacity of contributors, would have redrawn the state social insurance budget. As such, we have
aggregated the amounts collected from contributors registered in Romania to those which could have

Romania’s accession to the European Union, in that it has created new opportunities for labor
migration, heavily imbalanced the state social insurance budget. It is noted that the hypothetical
contribution of these would have been more than sufficient to ensure the sustainability of the Romanian
pension system. In fact, when the balance of income-expenditures is broken is when migration begins
an upward trend (2002 - 2003) and accentuates once with Romania’s accession to the European Union
in 2007.
The scenario considered in this approach does nothing else, beyond the mathematical calculation,
but to warn that the migration phenomenon, accentuated by Romania’s EU accession, has significant
implications on the social security component. The imbalance of social secur ity system is closely
linked to the economically active population trends. Calculations show that if state social insurance
contributions would have been collected from absolutely all Romanian emigrants the state social
insurance system in Romania would have been different. It should be recognized however that this
scenario has a number of limitations mostly due to the fact that not all migrants are economically active
population, on the other hand not all would have become employees, i.e. contributors, eve n if they
would have stayed in Romania.
However, we can conclude that, concerning the impact of emigration on the state social insurance
budget, this is a major cause of imbalances registered in the system. Also, we must point out that

also in terms of social assistance. For example, in 25 to 35 years, those who work illegally or not at all
(significant in number) will reach retirement age without being insured, and will burden the social
assistance system, claiming from public money the minimum guaranteed income or other forms of
social aid. At that time, the active age population (paying these costs through taxes and contributions to
insurance funds) will be less numerous, which will significantly increase taxes (World Bank 2009).
Romania’s accession to the European Union, produced in 2007, and the permanent process of
integration, the gradual liberalization of the labor market for Romanian citizens will increase the
dynamics of migration while at the same time will accentuate the imbalance on the social security
component.
In 2008, the European labor commissioner Vladimir Spidla said that the “Hidden economy
undermines the financing of social security systems, impedes the pursuit of coherent economic policies
and could lead to social dumping”. We might add that the phenomenon of migration, especially for
countries that face a downward trend of the volume of economically active population can produce the
same underfunding effect of social security systems.

SOCIAL SECURITY IN ROMANIA AF TER EU ACCESSION. RISKS

Abstract: This article reflects the evolution of the social security system in Romania after accession to
the European Union. Social security states its specificity as a basic concept that encompasses all the collective
measures established by legislation to maintain individual or family income, to provide income when some or all
sources have been lost or exhausted or in cases where the individual must cope with increased expenses. From
this perspective, social security is a system that takes into account both the protection of able-bodied people (by
the social insurance system) and of those who cannot work or are socially disadvantaged. For Romania, the
social security system is currently profoundly affected due to the low ratio between the number of productive
Romanian citizens, contributors to the public budget and social funds, and the beneficiaries of these funds. The
study highlights this issue and focuses primarily on the effect produced on the social security compo nent by the
external labor migration, a phenomenon accentuated by Romania’s EU accession. Basically, Romania has
registered, according to Eurostat, only after 2007, more than 1 million migrants, most constituting the
economically active population, the phenomenon having a major impact on the sustainability of the social
security system.

INTRODUCTION

Social security is a means to protect its nationals by the State when faced with the risks induced
by various social adversities. The development of an adequate social security system, the configuration
and acceptance of a coherent legal and economic framework on this issue is an investment in “human
infrastructure”, just as important as the investment in the physical infrastructure.

influencing their development strategy. Every person and every family needs protection from the risks
and uncertainties resulting from everyday activities. When this need is not satisfied for the individual
and his family, the released effects have significant negative implications on the individual’s comfort,
his motivation to work and especially on the sustainability and functionality of economic systems.
From a conceptual standpoint, social security refers to both social insurance and social assistance.
Social security includes: health insurance, maternity benefits, death grants, unemployment
compensation, pension, insurance for work accidents and occupational diseases. In this format, the
pension system is the largest sequence that composes the social security system. The main issue raised
in most discussions concerning the characterization of pension systems has as leitmotiv the dichotomy
between PAYG type systems and fully funded type systems.
Typically, the public pension system is founded on the idea of pay-as-you-go (PAYG), i.e. the
current payment of pensions from contributions collected from the present income of the working
population. On the other hand, there are private pension systems based on the accumulation and
investment of individual savings, also called fully funded.
The existing pension systems differ considerably between countries mainly due to the specific
historical path of each. For example, in countries with a significant social ideological and economic
foundation, such as France and Germany, the PAYG type pension schemes are more present. In o ther
countries, like Britain and the United States, with a liberal or neoliberal economic point of view, the
emphasis is on fully funded type systems. These pension schemes can also work mixed. In fact, in most
states, the main pillar for the funding of the pension provision consists of a public pension plan,
mandatory, and completed by a private pension system, be it mandatory or optional.

1. CHARACTERISTICS OF THE SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM IN ROMANIA

Currently, in Romania operates, as a basic formula, a public pension system of a redistributive
type based on the solidarity between generations, i.e. a PAYG type system. It is also called Pillar I. To
the public pension system contribute all employees plus any other taxpayers forced by law to pay the
SSC (social security contributions). The social security contribution rates are approved by the state
social insurance budget law. They are differentiated depending on working conditions: normal,
particular and special. The amounts collected from the State Social Insurance Budget out of which

the one hand, by the employer, and secondly, by the employee.
All contributors receive a pension right, but the link between the amount of contributions paid
during the lifetime and the pension amount is not proportionate. All contributors accumulate a score
according to the amounts paid, and the pension calculated is the result of the product between the
number of points and the point value. A formula that is very relative, because the point value is
determined politically and therefore subject to the country’s political development and the economic
and doctrinal orientation of those in power. This is one of the major flaws of the PAYG type public
pension system operating now in Romania. Currently, to the public pension system contribute
approximately 4.1 million employees which support about 4.7 million pensioners. The pension
formulas applied in the post-socialist period hoping to solve the growing unemployment (including
early retirement) have considerably increased the number of retirees. Thus, between 1990 and 2010, the
number of pensioners increased by approximately 80%. The deeply unbalanced situation in which the
pension system is, based on the principle of social solidarity, specific to PAYG, is reflected in the
increased rate of dependency between the number of pensioners and number of employees and the
upward direction in which it evolved between 1991 and 2010.
The ratio of employees and beneficiaries of state social insurance pension for the period 19912010 reflects the following situation:

In addition to pensions paid from the state social security budget, in Romania works the pension
system for farmers, different from the public system, not-contributory, which is supported which is
supported by resources from the state budget and providing retirement benefits for about 760,000
former farm workers. Then there are the special pensions of former employees of the defense system,
which had a special contribution scheme and we also mention other types of pensions such as those of
diplomats, judges, parliamentarians, etc. Also in the case of the latter the contributions scheme had a
special character.
A major challenge in terms of the reconfiguration of the pension system is the introduction of 2 nd
pillar, mandatory, of the fully funded type. In 2007, two pillars that match the private pension system
were introduced: the 2nd pillar (regulated by Law 411/2004) and the 3 rd pillar (regulated by Law
204/2006). The 2nd pillar is binding on all persons up to the age of 35. The contribution is voluntary for
those between 35 and 45 years. The 2 nd pillar represents the prefinanced component of the first pillar, a
part of the social security system contributions, being mandatorily directed towards pension funds
under private management. The contribution rate in the first year was 2% of the gross income, and will
reach a maximum of 6% by the end of 2016. For 2011, the contribution rate related to the private
pension funds is 3% (acc. to art. 17 paragraph [2] of Law no. 287/2010 on the state social insurance

rates were 31.3% (for normal working conditions), 36.3% (for particular working conditions) and
41.3% (for special working conditions). From this, the individual social security contribution rate is
10.5%, regardless of the working conditions. The evolution of the contribution rates for both
employees and employers for the period 1991-2009 is shown in the table below:

As noted, the individual social insurance contribution rate has evolved between 3% and 11.67%
for normal working conditions.

PENSIONERS. THE SCENARIOS METHOD USING THE AVERAGE GROSS EARNINGS
AND THE AVERAGE PENSION

The calculation made in this approach is a scenario based on average amounts collected annually
from individual contributions and employer contributions for normal working conditions, collections in
relation to average gross annual earnings and annual average pensions. Particular and special working
conditions have been disregarded, since these situations are less common.
The value of the contribution rate for each year for the period 1991 - 2009 has been taken as a
benchmark according to the data from the Ministry of Labor, Solidarity and Social Protection. For the
gross average earnings for each year of the period analyzed and the average monthly pension, the data
supplied by the National Institute of Statistics. Regarding the amounts collected, depending on
individual and employer contribution rates, having as base the average gross earnings for the period
1991-2009, the analysis revealed the following situation:

Thus, at an average pension of 233 dollars, with a total, in 2009, of 4.718 million pensioners
benefiting from state social insurance, the effort for supporting the m, taking as a basis for calculating
the average pension, is 13,201,054,668 dollars. Since 2009 marked only 4,367,700 employees (i.e.
contributors), which provide only 9,926,007,552 dollars in the form of social insurance, a major
discrepancy between the amount required to cover the pensions and the amounts collected by the state
social insurance system can be noticed.

3. IMPACT ON THE STATE SOCIAL INSURANCE BUDGET PRODUCED BY
MIGRATION FROM ROMANIA TO THE EUROPEAN UNION

The phenomenon of globalization has generated substantial movements in the international area,
among them being found in a significant proportion movement of persons, goods and capital. The
geopolitical and social context created following the fall of the Berlin Wall significantly shaped the
migration phenomenon, opening the possibility of movement of people mainly from Eastern Europe to
Western Europe. Freedom of movement gained by the citizens of Central and Eastern Europe after
1989 has allowed them to turn to other countries including for searching for jobs. The phenomenon,
somewhat timid at first because of the quite restrictive legislative conditionalities, accelerated once
with the enlargement of the European Union and liberalization of the labor market for all its citizens.
The continuous increase in the number of migrants allowed it to become an important phenomenon of
the current social reality. Currently, virtually all countries are involved in the comp lex process of
migration abroad, integrating in the general picture wither as countries of destination, either as
countries of origin or transit, and this makes migration to be one with multiple facets: economic, social
and political.

migration. The effect of this phenomenon is analyzed primarily through the impact on the social
security system component, deeply unbalanced by the major asymmetry between the number of
employees – thus of contributors – and the numbers of retirees. Article makes an analysis based on
existing statistical data at the level of specialized institutions such as the UN Population Fund, the
Ministry of Labor, Family and Social Protection, the National Institute of Statistics, Eurostat, OECD
etc.
From a conceptual point of view, the meaning of the terms used in this study referring to
migration is consistent with the general definitions established by the International Organization for
Migration. Thus, the concept of migration refers to movement of a person or a group of people outside
the community of residence, within a given reference period, in order to change domicile. From the
perspective of this study, migration is treated as one of the factors with the greatest impact on the
pension systems, the effects being obvious: lower share of contributions as a result of the reduction of
the number of contributors. Given the PAYG scheme financing of these pension programs (pension
system based on the principle of social solidarity, i.e. support by those who currently have an income of
those who worked in the past ), the tax burden is placed especially on employees and employers).
Research shows migration flows from Romania to the European Union. Data on migration flows
for the period 1991 to 2009 (this being the last year for which there is data ) were extracted from the
Eurostat. Where there were missing data, supplementing them was provided with data from
Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development. The situation of departures from Romania
to the European Union for the period 1991-2009 is shown in the chart below:

As seen from the data, consistent in the early 90s, migration falls on a downward route in the
period 1993-1997. We can note that the maximum moment in terms of migration was achieved in 2007,
therefore when Romania adhered to the European Union, which allowed for greater labor mobility.
Thus, in 2007 the total number of emigrants from Romania to the European Union was 555,797 people.
Based on the above data, the amount of state social contributions that would have been collected from
those who emigrated during the period 1991-2009 was calculated. The analysis is only a scenario that
assumes that all those who have emigrated are potentially economically active population. As such, due
to lack of evidence enabling an accurate quantification of migration for work abroad, we have used
data that reflect the total number of migrants (not only for work, but in general). In fact, a test applied
in Spain and Italy, countries that have attracted the largest number of Romanian migrants for the period
2005 - 2009 (period for which Eurostat provides data also on the age of migrants, from which it can be
deduced how many of the mass of migrants are potentially active population) shows that approximately
90% of the total migrants fall within the economically active population, aged between 15 and 65.
Thus, under the advanced scenario, if those who emigrated from Romania during 1991 - 2009
would have been contributors to the State Social Insurance Budget, the amounts with which they would
have contributed, according to the contribution rate established for the advanced period and according
to the average salary, would have been the following:

As shown in the table above, the hypothetical amounts that would have been collected from the
mass of Romanian emigrants, where they would have been in Romania and would have been enrolled
on the labor market are not at all insignificant.

CONCLUSIONS

The logic course of such calculations was to highlight the extent to which social insurance
contributions collected from those who emigrated from Romania, provided they would have acted in
the capacity of contributors, would have redrawn the state social insurance budget. As such, we have
aggregated the amounts collected from contributors registered in Romania to those which could have

Romania’s accession to the European Union, in that it has created new opportunities for labor
migration, heavily imbalanced the state social insurance budget. It is noted that the hypothetical
contribution of these would have been more than sufficient to ensure the sustainability of the Romanian
pension system. In fact, when the balance of income-expenditures is broken is when migration begins
an upward trend (2002 - 2003) and accentuates once with Romania’s accession to the European Union
in 2007.
The scenario considered in this approach does nothing else, beyond the mathematical calculation,
but to warn that the migration phenomenon, accentuated by Romania’s EU accession, has significant
implications on the social security component. The imbalance of social secur ity system is closely
linked to the economically active population trends. Calculations show that if state social insurance
contributions would have been collected from absolutely all Romanian emigrants the state social
insurance system in Romania would have been different. It should be recognized however that this
scenario has a number of limitations mostly due to the fact that not all migrants are economically active
population, on the other hand not all would have become employees, i.e. contributors, eve n if they
would have stayed in Romania.
However, we can conclude that, concerning the impact of emigration on the state social insurance
budget, this is a major cause of imbalances registered in the system. Also, we must point out that

also in terms of social assistance. For example, in 25 to 35 years, those who work illegally or not at all
(significant in number) will reach retirement age without being insured, and will burden the social
assistance system, claiming from public money the minimum guaranteed income or other forms of
social aid. At that time, the active age population (paying these costs through taxes and contributions to
insurance funds) will be less numerous, which will significantly increase taxes (World Bank 2009).
Romania’s accession to the European Union, produced in 2007, and the permanent process of
integration, the gradual liberalization of the labor market for Romanian citizens will increase the
dynamics of migration while at the same time will accentuate the imbalance on the social security
component.
In 2008, the European labor commissioner Vladimir Spidla said that the “Hidden economy
undermines the financing of social security systems, impedes the pursuit of coherent economic policies
and could lead to social dumping”. We might add that the phenomenon of migration, especially for
countries that face a downward trend of the volume of economically active population can produce the
same underfunding effect of social security systems.
