The rise of noncommunicable diseases in Latin America
and the Caribbean: challenges for public health policies

•

The developing world, and in particular Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC),
has experienced both a secular decline in mortality and signiﬁcant improvements in
the health of its population over the last 200 years. As we start the twenty-ﬁrst
century, a key observation is that the pattern and nature of mortality and morbidity
has changed over recent decades and continues changing today. Health systems in
developing countries are facing major challenges mainly because of growing
epidemiological diversity as a consequence of economic development, technological change in medicine, and population aging.
Although LAC is not completely free of infectious diseases, is well advanced in
its demographic and epidemiological transitions, with health problems highly
concentrated on noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). People in the region are
equally likely to die prematurely from just one NCD than from all communicable
diseases combined. Half of years of life lost in the region, as well as the leading
causes of mortality and morbidity, are attributable to NCDs (Anderson et al. 2009).
Furthermore, there is little doubt that the levels of NCDs will substantially increase
in the near future. It is predicted that by 2020, NCDs will cause seven of every ten
deaths in developing countries (Boutayeb 2006). Two of the factors believed to be
central drivers of this trend are aging populations and the stark and simultaneous
increase in rates of obesity worldwide (WHO 2013a).
Noncommunicable diseases, which are characterized by shared risk factors,
multi-morbidity, and chronicity, pose several challenges for the organization of
healthcare. To address these challenges, policymakers must deﬁne a health policy
frontier that identiﬁes the primary interventions according to current health
priorities. Taking into account where LAC stands in term of both its demographic
and epidemiological transition, the health policy frontier in the region must include
(1) public health policies that reduce the risk factors that cause NCDs by promoting
healthy behavior; and (2) health insurance programs that offer households access to
quality healthcare at costs that do not impoverish them.
Regarding the ﬁrst priority of the health policy frontier, interventions that create
conducive environments for making healthy choices available are essential to
motivate people to adopt and sustain healthy behaviors. Although it is known that
eliminating preventable risk factors may reduce the burden of NCDs, it is not known
what the best way is to achieve this goal. Most public policies designed to address
NCDs use a rational economic model of behavior that assumes people make choices
that reﬂect their preferences subject to their available resources (time, information,
and prices of goods and labor). However, the consensus on the success of traditional
efforts to encourage health promotion is that they have been at best modestly
effective (Luoto and Carman 2014).
People could deviate from a rational model of behavior, for example, there is
evidence that present bias (i.e., a higher discount rate between the present and the
immediate future than between two future time periods) plays an important role in
health behavior (Kremer and Glennerster 2012). People also face knowledge
the available knowledge rationally. For instance, they may choose poor diets simply
because they do not know which diets are healthy.
This paper explores these issues by developing a simple theoretical model of
household decision-making to assess how lack of knowledge along with self-control
issues affect people’s behavior related to food consumption, which later leads to
weight problems and obesity. The focus is on obesity because it is the second
highest behavioral risk factor affecting mortality (Flegal et al. 2005; Willett et al.
2005) and is now one of the major causes of rising healthcare costs (Finkelstein
et al. 2003). In addition, there has been a remarkable upsurge in the number of
people considered overweight or obese in all demographic and age groups in LAC.
Compared with other regions, weight problems and obesity are particularly
prevalent in LAC, with rates that range from 30 to 50 % (York et al. 2004).
The model presented in this paper predicts that when individuals have either selfcontrol problems or knowledge constraints, they make decisions that lead them to
behave in a way that is not in their own best interest or that are unwise even
according to their own preferences. People with self-control problems impose
negative externalities on their future. Those within-person externalities have been
called ‘‘internalities’’ (Whitman 2006). The harm resulting from an internality might
be avoided in more than one way. Unfortunately, the private market only
imperfectly provides such self-control mechanisms (Gruber 2002). It is very
difﬁcult to truly commit oneself to not overeat or to maintain an exercise routine, for
example. This suggests a potential role for cost-effective policies. However, these
policies should not prevent people from behaving in their own best interests. Ideally,
these policies should create beneﬁts for those who do not make reliable decisions in
their best interest while be harmless to those that make reliable decisions.
Robust evidence on policy interventions that address these biases among
overweight and obese people is rather limited, and its results are mixed at best.
Looking across the spectrum of health behaviors, it can be seen that behavioral
economics offers insights that seem to hold promise for cost-effective public
interventions. Speciﬁcally, most cost-effective policies to combat weight problems
and obesity, at least in the short and medium term, seem to be those that combine
the provision of information with counseling and with elements of behavioral
economics such as incentives or commitment mechanisms. In view of that,
identifying which interventions are the most cost effective in achieving healthy
behaviors in the long term is a priority of research.
In the absence of these cost-effective interventions, policymakers must turn to
second-best policies that could involve ‘‘sin’’ taxes and subsidies to discourage the
consumption of unhealthy food. The overall empirical evidence documents that
price manipulations have the potential to encourage healthier eating, particularly
when those manipulations are large. Nevertheless, an important topic for future
work is investigating how changes in prices affect health outcomes and what pricing
strategies would be optimal for addressing excess food consumption and rising rates
of obesity.
Regarding the second priority of the health policy frontier, the provision of health
healthcare services is restricted to workers in the formal sector, excluding those in
the informal sector who encompass approximately 50 percent of the region’s labor
force. Thus, LAC countries face the challenge of expanding health insurance
coverage in a scenario in which a large share of the labor force is employed in the
informal sector. There is little agreement among countries as to how best to achieve
broader coverage. Policy interventions proposed here include social health
insurance systems combined with publicly subsidized health insurance programs,
as well as tax-ﬁnanced systems of public health.
A potential unintended consequence of combining social health insurance with
publicly subsidized health insurance programs is the incentive it may create for
formal sector workers to switch to informal employment. By doing so, workers
could avoid having to make otherwise mandatory contributions to the social health
insurance system while receiving some free services under the new program. This
paper presents a theoretical model that shows that employment-based health
insurance schemes interfere with the functioning of the labor market. Speciﬁcally,
the model predicts that improvements in the provision of public healthcare (e.g.,
public hospitals) increase the size of the informal sector and decrease the wages of
this sector, while increasing the wages of the formal sector.
There is scarce rigorous empirical evidence of the effect of publicly subsidized
health insurance programs on workers’ choices of formal or informal employment
in the region. Thus, a better understanding of the distortions generated by public
health insurance programs and the magnitude of their effects on both health status
and informality is central to inform policy decisions.
Finally, the introduction of public health insurance programs may also lead to
problems of moral hazard, which refers to the effect of insurance on the behavior of
the insured. One of the criteria that the literature has proposed for designing public
health insurance programs is to minimize the efﬁciency loss resulting from the
introduction of such insurance (Sloan and Hsieh 2012). Policymakers have to
balance moral hazard and risk protection in the design of public health insurance
programs.
The next section of this paper explores the evolution of LAC in terms of its
demographic and epidemiological transitions. Section 3 develops a simple theoretical model of health, self-control, and knowledge in the context NCDs and discusses
cost-effective interventions to address these problems. Section 4 presents the
rationales for creating health insurance programs and describes components of their
design. Section 5 summarizes the main features of the healthcare systems in the
region, and Sect. 6 presents a conceptual framework that assesses the relationship
between health insurance and the labor market. Section 7 examines alternative
policies to expand health insurance coverage for poor and unskilled workers in the
informal sector and brieﬂy describes the potential problems this might create in
terms of incentivizing informality and moral hazard. Finally, Sect. 8 presents
This section aims to determine the current stage of LAC’s demographic and
epidemiological transition. The implication for policymakers is straightforward:
identifying where the region is in terms of these transitions is critical to establish a
health policy frontier. The section ﬁrst examines the long-term trends of health
worldwide and then develops a conceptual framework to approach the epidemiological and demographic transition of the region. Second, the section describes the
pattern of change in mortality and morbidity from communicable to NCDs to
determine the priorities for health policies.
2.1 Health in the long term
Throughout the twentieth century, growth in real income in developed countries was
accompanied by a historically unprecedented reduction in mortality rates that caused
life expectancy at birth to grow by nearly 30 years. These improvements were
matched by similar advancements in poor and middle-income countries. In the years
just after World War II, life expectancy gaps between rich and poor countries started to
contract across the world. Poor and middle-income countries enjoyed rapid growth in
life expectancy in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s. For example, while the increase in
longevity between 1960 and 2005 in the USA was 7.9 years, in the same period the
increase in longevity in China was 35.5 years (Sloan and Hsieh 2012).
Looking at the evidence as a whole, it is possible to see the history of reduced
mortality and increases in life expectancy as encompassing three phases (Cutler
et al. 2006; Deaton 2005). During the ﬁrst phase from the middle of the eighteenth
century to the middle of the nineteenth century, improved nutrition and economic
growth played a large role in health. During this phase, infectious disease mortality
declined by 95 %. Fogel (1994, 1997, 2004) assigned nutritional improvements the
primary role in this reduction in mortality. He argued that agricultural yields
increased signiﬁcantly during the eighteenth century, and as a result, people were
better fed and thus could better resist most bacterial (although not viral) disease, and
could recover more rapidly and more often. Neither personal healthcare nor public
health appeared to have had much impact prior to the 1900s, when most of the
mortality decline had already occurred in rich countries (McKeown 1976).
The second phase occurred in the closing decades of the nineteenth century and into
the twentieth century. In this phase, the primary factors that contributed to the secular
reduction in mortality were revolutionary improvements in sanitation and developments in public health policy (e.g., ﬁltering and chlorinating water supplies, building
sanitation systems, draining swamps, and pasteurizing milk). Public health did not
fully come into its own until the acceptance of the germ theory of disease in the 1880s
and 1890s, which led to a wave of new public health initiatives and the conveyance of
safe health practices such as boiling bottles of milk, protecting food from insects,
washing hands, and ventilating rooms, among others. The dramatic subsequent
reduction in water- and food-borne diseases (typhoid, cholera, dysentery, and
infectious disease. Over the course of the twentieth century, the role of medical
advances increased in importance and gave place to the third phase in mortality
reduction, which dates from the 1930s to the present. This phase has been the era of
big medicine, starting with vaccinations and antibiotics, and moving on to the
expensive and intensive personal interventions that characterize the medical system
today. The ﬁrst important medical interventions were vaccinations. However,
quantitatively more important for mortality was the development of new therapeutics, such as antibiotics. By 1960, mortality from infectious diseases had declined to
its current level.
This ‘‘mortality revolution’’ spread throughout the world much more rapidly than
did modern economic growth, leading to enormous improvements in low- and
middle-income countries in life expectancy and mortality rates, especially among
children. In these countries, the reduction in mortality began in the early twentieth
century and then accelerated dramatically after World War II (Lee 2003). This
mainly happened because 200 years’ worth of progress against mortality in rich
countries was rapidly brought to bear on mortality in poor and middle-income
countries. Measures primary related to disease control—such as improvements in
the water supply, cleansing the environment of disease vectors, the use of
antibiotics, and widespread immunization of children—were introduced to the rest
of the world over a relatively very short span of time (Cutler et al. 2006). LAC in
particular has shown a great propensity to catch up to developed countries over the
last half century, particularly since 1970 (Jack 1999).
2.2 Demographic and epidemiological transitions
The pattern and nature of mortality and morbidity has changed over the past 100 years
and continues to change in developing countries today. This so-called epidemiological
transition is linked with the current demographic transition, wherein population age
structures also undergo signiﬁcant changes as societies develop.
The classic demographic transition starts with mortality reduction, followed after
a time by reduced fertility. According to economic theories of fertility, couples wish
to have a certain number of surviving children, rather than births per se, hence, if
this assumption holds, once potential parents recognize an exogenous increase in
child survival, fertility should decline. This causes population growth rates ﬁrst to
accelerate and then to slow again, moving toward low fertility, long life, and an old
population.
Although important differences remain, there has been a rapid global convergence in fertility and mortality among nations. The demographic transition has
spread to all parts of the world, and is projected to be completed by 2100, when the
global population will have risen by a factor of 10 compared with that in 1800, the
length of life will have tripled from 27 years in 1800 to 81 at 2100, and births per
woman will have dropped from six to two (Lee 2003).
The epidemiological transition has paralleled the demographic transition in
developed countries and is still under way in less-developed societies. During the
1971).
With health and social conditions improving, people survive through their early
years into middle and older ages where they face the elevated risk of dying from
chronic diseases. The most favorable effects on survival are concentrated among
infants, children, and women of childbearing age (Olshansky and Ault 1986). Thus,
the reduction in mortality that comes with the epidemiological transition widens the
‘‘demographic gap’’ between birth rates and death rates, and hence affects the
demographic change by bolstering population growth. In a more subtle manner, the
mortality transition affects demographic movements indirectly through its impact on
fertility and the composition of the population.
Rich countries have completed the shift from an epidemiological era characterized by the preponderance of communicable diseases to one characterized by NCDs
(Frenk et al. 1994). Developing countries have also been following this path: during
at least the past half century, their epidemiological proﬁle has been characterized by
both a sharp reduction in mortality rates and a differentiation of the causes of deaths.
Emerging NCDs have been increasing over the past two decades (Yach et al. 2004),
and are predicted to continue to rise.
The goal of trying to describe and disentangle the determinants of changing
disease patterns is to elucidate some of the fundamental issues confronting
policymakers. Health policymakers should undertake an epidemiological analysis of
major diseases and health problems to deﬁne the relevant health policy frontier. This
implies focusing on policies and targeting resources according to current health
priorities without neglecting those health areas where intervention has been
successful.
In other words, if a country is in the early stage of the epidemiological transition
during which major health problems are concentrated on communicable diseases,
health policy should be centered on providing curative services—such as routine
healthcare, vaccinations, and rehydration therapy—as well as on designing
programs to improve sanitation.
On the other side, if a country is in a more advanced stage of its epidemiological
transition during which health problems are concentrated on NCDs and chronic
diseases in adults and the elderly, the health policy frontier should be centered on
preventive health services and health promotion. In this case, health promotion
strategies should focus on behavioral changes related to smoking, alcohol, diet, and
exercise to prevent deaths due to obesity, hypertension, atherosclerosis, and
diabetes. This will require government interventions not only in education but also
through regulation and taxation (Jamison and Mosley 1991; Yach et al. 2004).
Policies to extend health insurance coverage are also essential considering that
NCDs require long-term treatment.
2.3 Health conditions in Latin America and the Caribbean: an overview
In LAC the past 50 years have been positive in terms of overall levels of health, life
epidemiological transitions, with health problems highly concentrated on NCDs
(Frenk et al. 1989).
Since 1970, death from infections has been declining while death from NCDs has
been increasing. There was a signiﬁcant change in the causes of death over a
relatively short period of time. This suggests that the epidemiological transition has
accelerated in the last 40 years. At present, 14.2 % of total deaths are due to
communicable diseases, while NCDs and injures are responsible for 73.4 and
12.4 % of total deaths, respectively. Furthermore, an increase in NCDs is expected
over the coming decades in LAC.
2.3.1 Demographic transition
LAC countries have undergone profound demographic changes that are reﬂected in
the reduction in population growth (by 1.3 % from 2005 to 2010) and in the aging of
the population. This change results from a rapid fall in fertility, which has reached a
rate of decline never seen before in the region (Frenk et al. 1994)—fertility fell to
2.3 children per women in the region according to UNDESA (2013)—preceded by a
sustained reduction in mortality (Fig. 1; Table 1). The reduction in mortality, which
began toward the end of the ﬁrst half of the twentieth century, has now resulted in a
life expectancy at birth of 73.4 years (Table 2).
Child mortality is a key indicator not only of child health and nutrition but also of
the implementation of child survival interventions and, more broadly, of social and
economic development. Table 1 shows that since 1970, LAC has reduced its under5 mortality rate by more than 70 % and is among the developing regions with the

taken place rapidly. Although there is still some variation between and within
countries, at the regional level two major changes have taken place: a reduction in
demographic dependency (ratio of people younger than 14 or older than 65 to the
working-age population) and population aging (ECLAC 2007). Slowly but surely,
population is getting older: the proportion and the absolute number of persons aged
65 and over will rise steadily in the coming decades (Table 3). As a result, it is
projected that the number of persons aged 65 or over will be almost ﬁve times
higher in 2050 than in 2000.
Demographic aging poses signiﬁcant challenges for governments. First, there is
consensus that it is essential to increase social security coverage of the current work
force and to expand coverage of the elderly, including the option of noncontributory
or welfare pensions. Second, there is a need to shift the focus of care to preventive
care and health promotion, not only in old age, but also at all other stages of the life
cycle (ECLAC 2007).
2.3.2 Epidemiological transition: communicable and noncommunicable diseases
This subsection attempts to describe the leading causes of death from a regional
perspective to characterize the epidemiological proﬁle in LAC.
2.3.2.1 Communicable diseases In the last three decades of the twentieth century
and in the early twenty-ﬁrst century, the most important public health achievements in
LAC have been in communicable disease control and basic sanitation (Echeverri et al.
2008). The displacement of communicable diseases by NCDs as the leading cause of
death provides evidence of the region’s epidemiological transition (Frenk et al. 1994).
Among communicable diseases in LAC, infectious and parasitic diseases and
respiratory infections constitute the leading cause of death. Tuberculosis, HIV/
AIDS, diarrheal diseases, and vector-borne diseases are the most prevalent.
Evidence shows that the region has succeeded in decreasing premature death and
disability from most communicable, newborn, nutritional, and maternal causes.

between 1998 and 2008.1 The region has made signiﬁcant progress in controlling
tuberculosis and vector-borne diseases, but HIV/AID remains a major challenge
(Table 4). Diarrheal disease was the number one disease burden in LAC in 1990,
but dropped to the 20th leading cause in 2010 (World Bank and Institute for Health
Metrics and Evaluations 2010). Among the principal bacterial agents of diarrheal
diseases is Vibrio cholerae (cholera). However, the prevalence of this disease
region-wide has declined. The number of cholera cases reported to the World Health
Organization, as well as the number of countries that reported cholera cases in the
region, decreased in 2012 (WHO 2013b).
The most sustainable investment to protect populations from cholera and other
diarrheal diseases continues to be improvements in water supply and sanitation. The
region has increased coverage of safe water (access to safe water increased from
82 % of the population in 1990 to 89 % in 2002) and extended sanitation coverage,
although some countries in LAC still have a long way to go (Fay and Morrison
2007).
Thus, communicable diseases have become less preponderant over time and no
longer pose the greatest current threat to public health. However, it is important to
recognize that they still maintain a position in the epidemiological proﬁle.
2.3.2.2 Noncommunicable diseases According to epidemiological research,
chronic NCDs are the biggest threat to the health of the world population.
Figures for 2011 indicate that almost 36 million people died from NCDs around the
world that year, and it is projected that by 2030 the leading causes of death will be
ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease (COPD; De Maio 2011).
Murray and Lopez (1997) argue that the ratio of NCDs to communicable diseases
is a crude but useful indicator of the epidemiological transition. This ratio ranges
from more than 13 in established market economies to 0.4 in sub-Saharan Africa.
According to this criterion, China, followed distantly by LAC and other Asia
islands, are all further along the path of the combined demographic and
epidemiological transitions, which surely will affect potential demand for health
services in these countries.
LAC has the third highest level of deaths due to NCDs and trails closely behind
the group of high-income countries (Table 5). Cardiovascular diseases and
malignant neoplasms, followed by diabetes and chronic respiratory diseases are
the leading causes of deaths from NCDs in LAC.
From the point of view of the demographic transition, the major effect of reduced
fertility is the resulting change in age structure, as mentioned earlier. Furthermore,
the growing proportion of adults and the elderly increases the relative importance of
NCDs. Moreover, certain NCDs are starting to attack demographics previously
unaffected. For instance, type two diabetes, generally known as adult onset diabetes,
is increasingly common among young populations.

Cardiovascular diseases

Of total deaths caused by cardiovascular diseases in LAC, 85 % were due to four
causes: ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, heart failure, and hypertensive diseases. Among these, ischemic heart disease is the leading cause of death
in the region, with rates markedly higher among males than females.
The major established risk factors of cardiovascular diseases are hypertension,
diabetes mellitus, high cholesterol, obesity, and smoking. These factors, which
mainly depend on behavior, are highly prevalent in the region, with the most
signiﬁcant being unhealthy diets, physical inactivity, and smoking. Behavioral risk
factors are responsible for about 80 % of coronary heart disease and cerebrovascular
disease.
Being overweight or obese are major risk factors for a number of chronic diseases
apart from cardiovascular diseases, including diabetes and cancer. Worldwide
obesity has nearly doubled since 1980. In 2008, more than 1.4 billon adults were
overweight (deﬁned as a body mass index, or BMI, of 25 or above). Of these, over
200 million men and women were obese (deﬁned as a BMI of 30 or above).
Compared with other regions, obesity is highly prevalent in LAC: the rate for
obesity and being overweight ranges from 30 to 50 % (York et al. 2004).
Furthermore, a recent WHO/PAHO survey revealed an increasing trend in obesity in
the region, and Finucane et al. (2011) estimate that between 1980 and 2008 the
average BMI for women in Central America and South America increased by 1.3
and 1.4 U per decade, respectively.
This pattern is also seen in the prevalence of smoking, which is increasing in
many low- and middle-income countries. Surveys in 14 Latin America countries
reported that the prevalence of this behavioral risk varied from 24.1 to 66.3 %
among men, and from 5.5 to 26.6 % among women (Lanas et al. 2007). WHO
projections suggest that by 2020 tobacco will become the largest single cause of

Malignant neoplasms and chronic respiratory diseases

The second leading cause of death from NCDs in LAC is cancer. WHO estimates
that the percentage increase in cancer incidence by 2030, compared with 2008, will
be greater in low-income and lower middle-income countries (82 and 70 %,
respectively) than in upper middle-income and high-income countries (58 and 40 %,
respectively). The most important cancers in terms of frequency, absolute number of
deaths, and mortality are lung, liver, and stomach cancer.
Chronic respiratory diseases (asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD), emphysema, and chronic bronchitis) represent a challenge to public health
in the region because of their frequency, severity, and economic impact. In 2011,
these diseases caused 5.3 % of all deaths. Among these diseases, COPD and asthma
are the most important, and in middle-income countries they are emerging as serious
public health problems. Furthermore, WHO has predicted a rise in mortality from
COPD from the fourth leading cause of death in 2004 to the third in 2030, largely
attributable to rising tobacco consumption and biomass fuel exposure, both major
risk factors for COPD and overwhelmingly prevalent in developing countries.
•

Diabetes

Diabetes is responsible for 6.4 % of all deaths in LAC but it is expected to more
than double between 2000 and 2030, affecting an estimated 32.9 million people in
the region (Wild et al. 2004). The number of people with diabetes is increasing due
to population growth, aging, and the higher prevalence of obesity. Poorly controlled
diabetes increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases, neuropathy, amputation, and
blindness.
Diabetes continues to be one of the greatest threats to health in the twenty-ﬁrst
century, and the number of cases will continues to rise unless prevention improves,

Neurological conditions

Globally, an estimated 1.5 million people died from neurological conditions in
2011. Among them, Alzheimer’s disease (and other forms of dementia), epilepsy,
and Parkinson’s disease are the leading causes of death. Population aging is
having a profound impact on the emergence of the dementia epidemic, with
Alzheimer’s disease and vascular dementia the most common underlying
pathologies. Age-standardized prevalence for people older than 60 years varies
in a narrow band of 5–7 % in most world regions, with a higher prevalence in
LAC (8.5 %). It is expected that the number of persons living with dementia will
double every 20 years to 65.7 million by 2030 and 115.4 million by 2050 (Prince
et al. 2013).
Around ﬁve million people in LAC suffer from epilepsy. Different studies show
that the median prevalence of lifetime epilepsy and active epilepsy in this region is
15.8 per 1000 inhabitants and 10.7 per 1000 inhabitants per year, respectively, and
that the median incidence is 132.2 per 100,000 inhabitants per year (Bruno et al.
2013). These rates are relatively high compared to other regions, such as the
northern hemisphere countries.
To summarize, taking into account where LAC stands in terms of its
epidemiological and demographic transitions, it is crucial to establish a health
policy frontier that meets the new patterns of health of the population, which are
characterized by a high prevalence of NCDs that share risk factors and are chronic.
In this context, the health policy frontier in the region must include (1) public health
policies to reduce the risk factors that cause NCDs by promoting healthy behavior;
and (2) health insurance programs that offer households access to quality healthcare
at costs that do not impoverish them.
Consequently, policies that create environments conducive to making healthy
choices affordable are essential to motivate people to adopt and sustain healthy
behavior. In addition, it is fundamental to have policies that support the design of a
health insurance system that provides healthcare coverage for long-term treatment.
A comprehensive analysis of policies in these two areas is beyond the scope of this
paper. However, the sections that follow focus on two important areas of the health
policy discussion where the tools of economic analysis are particularly useful:
public health efforts to encourage changes toward healthier behaviors, and the
structure of health insurance programs in the region.

3 Noncommunicable diseases: obesity
This section starts with a brief introduction to the causes of obesity, then develops a
simple model of health to assess how knowledge and self-control problems affect
people’s behavior related to food consumption. Finally, the section explores the
Humanity is changing in both size and shape. As mentioned before, there has been a
remarkable upsurge in the number of people considered overweight or obese. The
rapidity with which the incidence of obesity has increased suggests that genetic
change on a population level is an unlikely cause although there must be biological
factors involved with the obesity epidemic.2 Furthermore, not all people are
becoming fat. Thus, how can we explain both the sudden change in human mean
weight and the variability among people in essentially the same environments?
Power and Schulkin (2009) suggest that much of the increase in obesity is due to a
mismatch between adaptive biological characteristics of our species and the modern
environment, which has changed dramatically from the one under which we
evolved. According to these authors, human obesity is an inappropriate response to
modern living conditions.
Human obesity is an example of an adaptive biological system that is storing fat
in the body. Most fat is stored in adipose tissue, and fat is an efﬁcient way to store
energy. Excess energy, consumed at one time, is stored as fat in adipose tissue to be
mobilized and used at a later time when food supply is inadequate. In the past, the
ability to store an increased amount of adipose tissue was largely constrained by the
external environment. Life was hard and food was often scarce; hence, humans
evolved to respond and adapt to those conditions (Neel 1962). However, the modern
environment has relaxed many of those constraints—to some extent, food is
plentiful, and obtaining it does not require extreme or prolonged exertion. This
development, in addition to technological, economic, and cultural factors, has
created the circumstances that allow for the increased numbers of overweight and
obese people in the world. Thus, the current epidemic of obesity results from the
interaction of our environment with past behaviors that are inappropriate in the
modern world (Power and Schulkin 2009). Understanding why these factors lead to
obesity requires analyzing the underlying biology.
According to Power and Schulkin (2009) there are three key aspects of human
biology that represent adaptive evolutionary changes in our physiology and
metabolism that increase the susceptibility to obesity under modern conditions:
our large (and metabolically expensive) brains; an increase in neonatal fatness;
and an increase in maternal fatness. Our larger brain provides us with greatly
enhanced cognitive abilities, but it also comes with substantial metabolic and
nutrient costs. In the past, external constraints limited our ability to consume fat
and to metabolically produce fat from excess energy intake. These circumstances
led to our ancestors’ enhanced ability to store fat, at least in females, and as
fetuses and infants.
The biology of building and maintaining our brains may explain many of the
preferences that put us at risk of obesity now that we have used technology and
culturally transmitted knowledge to increase access to food and decrease the
exertion required to survive. In other words, our large brains have allowed us to
2

Less than 5 % of obese people have been shown to have identiﬁable hormonal, physiological, or
appears to have been accompanied by the selection of physiology and behavior that
make many people susceptible to obesity (Power and Schulkin 2009, 322).
The factors that affect our diet, activity, and eventually our motivation to
behave in ways that make us vulnerable to gaining excess fat cannot all be
explained by biology. Cutler et al. (2003) suggest that the division of labor in food
preparation may explain the increase in calories consumed during the past
50 years. They argue that since the 1960s there has been a revolution in the mass
preparation of food, roughly comparable to the mass production revolution in
manufactured goods that happened a century ago. Technological innovations have
enabled food manufacturers to cook food centrally and ship it to consumers for
rapid consumption. The switch from individual to mass preparation lowered the
time price of food consumption and the ﬁxed costs of food preparation. They
argue that the lower time costs have led to increased food consumption, and
ultimately increased weights.
The standard economic view argues that lower prices for any good increase the
budget set and make people better off. However, if there are market failures, such as
asymmetric information, this result might not be true. In the case of obesity, there is
evidence of information failure, particularly under-provision of information or lack
of knowledge. Beyond this market failure, there is also evidence that individuals
prioritize immediate gratiﬁcation over potential long-term negative results (Swinburn et al. 2011; Kremer and Glennester 2012). Self-control problems and lack of
knowledge can lead individuals to suboptimal investment in preventive health
behavior; in this context, lowering the time costs of food consumption may
exacerbate this problem.
3.2 A simple model of health, self-control and household knowledge
A combination of imperfect information about the beneﬁts of certain behaviors and
the emphasis people put on immediate gratiﬁcation may lead individuals to take
decisions that do not improve their quality of life (Banerjee and Duﬂo 2011).
Households select recipes based on certain prior beliefs about the effects and side
effects of different alternatives. They are neither perfectly informed nor totally
ignorant of the implications of their choices, although in making those choices they
try to process the available knowledge rationally. Yet, in so doing, they are limited
because the perceptions of the actual relationship between their actions and their
health may differ for two reasons. First, the best knowledge available may not be
entirely correct or may even be false. Second, there may be a gap between the state
of the art and the knowledge actually used by households, either because household
members do not know the best practices or because despite having access to those
practices they refuse to follow the recommendations, not having been convinced
that the health advantages of a particular good are worth the cost or effort.
Consequently, households not only face a budget constraint but also a knowledge
constraint (Mokyr 2002).
Self-control issues are likely to be important as well. For example, people
(Cutler et al. 2003). A similar pattern can be observed in tobacco and alcohol use,
where individuals have time-inconsistent preferences even though they recognize
the long-run trade-offs between current and future health. Several studies suggest
that present bias leads consumers to underinvest in preventive behavior (Kremer and
Glennerster 2012).
For the sake of simplicity, we adapt the framework proposed by Cutler et al.
(2003) and Mokyr (2002) to a discrete time model with three periods (youth,
adulthood, and old age) during which a representative consumer discounts all time
in the future at a higher discount rate, but trades off consumption in the future at the
time discount rate. Such an individual will always want to begin a diet or an
exercise routine tomorrow, or to reduce consumption of tobacco later (because the
long-term beneﬁts justify the lost utility tomorrow) but not today (because of the
immediate gratiﬁcation from food, tobacco, or leisure).
For this model we formally use the hyperbolic discounting framework. Following
Cutler et al. (2003), we assume that people discount the future in two ways. The ﬁrst
is standard exponential utility: for a period of time t in the future, people get qt units
of utility, where 0 q 1: In addition, people also make a distinction between the
‘‘current self’’ and the ‘‘future self.’’ This distinction is the essence of the hyperbolic
model, which captures the property that discount rates decline (weakly) with
horizon length; therefore, events in the near future are discounted at a higher
implicit discount rate than events in a distant future. People discount the future
self’s utility with the parameter 0 c 1. If c ¼ 1, the future is considered the same
as today; if c ¼ 0, the future is ignored. With probability p, people switch from
being current selves to being future selves. Thus, the value of future consumption is
probabilistic; with probability p the future utility remains connected to the current
self, and with probability ð1 À pÞ the future utility is associated with the future self
and is worth only c because the individual is myopic.
At each point in time, people receive utility from consumption of both a durable
composite commodity (C) and food, represented by caloric intake (X). Individuals
also receive utility from a composite variable of life expectancy and health (H). To
eliminate income effects, we assume utility is linear in the composite commodity
and that income (Y) is high enough:
Ut ¼ Ct þ vðXt Þ þ Ht
The cost of food in period t is Pt, including both time and ﬁnancial costs. Individuals
are assumed to face no credit constraints, so they can lend or borrow at rate i. The
special characteristic of this setup is that H is determined by the household production function:
Ht ¼ lHtÀ1 þ E þ ðA À eÞFðXtÀ1 Þ;
where E is a common factor independent of the consumption basket and can be
interpreted as the environment over which the consumer has no control, and F
represents how goods consumed and time spent producing them are transformed
(i.e., caloric intake) can be harmful to health if it exceeds a certain threshold.
It is important to realize that the best practice knowledge could still be far from
the accurate truth. The parameter A is a shift factor that measures the degree to
which the best practice grasps the true effects of caloric intake on health. A ranges
from one to zero; A ¼ 1 means that the best practice fully captures the impact of
food consumption on health, while at the other extreme, A ¼ 0 means that the best
practice is uninformative about the consequences and no one knows that food
consumption has any effect on health at all (and thus the only reason why food is
consumed is because it conveys direct utility). Moreover, individuals lag in their
knowledge behind best practice techniques. Therefore, e is an individual-speciﬁc
measure of the difference between an individual’s technology and the best practice
regarding good X. It may be best viewed as a gap between the best technique in
society and what an individual actually believes. Consequently, the term ðA À eÞ
measures the degree to which the consumer is aware of and believes the mapping of
food consumption on health, and it is deﬁned here for simplicity as a multiplicative
deviation from ideal priors. We expect this term to be somewhere between 0 and 1.
An increase in ðA À eÞ within that interval means that a consumer can do better in
terms of overall utility simply by redeploying the available resources. If
ðA À eÞ ¼ 1, the consumer follows the best practice by some kind of ideal standard.
If e ¼ 0 but A\1, the consumer follows the best practice by the imperfect standards
of the time. The possibility that ðA À eÞ [ 1 is especially interesting. This means
that the consumer is exaggerating the perceived effect of the good on his or her
health and thus underconsuming it to the point where its quantity is suboptimal.

This functional form works perfectly for food because at low levels of consumption, health improves as
a result of food, but it worsens when the level of consumption is high. Similar results could be obtained
for a functional form that is decreasing on the whole range, which describes the case of alcohol and

Since consumers have to spend their income, they will pick a certain combination of
goods according to their taste and partial knowledge. In equilibrium consumers will

To analyze how self-control issues and household knowledge affect the behavior
of consumers, we study the comparative statics of the model. The results obtained,
which are described below, are proven in Appendix 1.
Result 1 When there is a larger gap between an individual’s knowledge and the
best practice technique, which assess the impact of caloric intake on health, the
consumption of food is higher in both the ﬁrst and second period (i.e.,
dX0
dX1
de [ 0; de [ 0).
Result 2 When individuals care more about the future, their caloric intake is
lower in both the ﬁrst and second period (i.e., dX0 \0; dX1 \0).
dc
dc
Thus, increases in the gap (represented by e) between the best practice technique
and what an individual actually believes will produce overconsumption of caloric
intake in the ﬁrst and second period (X0 and X1 ), regardless of the value of the
discount parameter (c). Therefore, a person’s level of health will be lower.
Similarly, reductions in the discount parameter (c) make consumers less forwardlooking (they worry less about their future) and lead to more immediate
consumption that is reﬂected in the overconsumption of caloric intake in the ﬁrst
and second periods (X0 and X1 ). Thus, our model predicts that when individuals
have either self-control problems or knowledge constraints, they make errors that
lead them not to behave in their own best interest or to make decisions that are
unwise even according to their own values and preferences.4

3.3 Policy implications
This subsection analyzes interventions that may be part of an appropriate portfolio
of government policies to combat self-control problems and knowledge constraints
to prevent people from becoming overweight or obese.
A growing literature argues that people with self-control problems impose
negative externalities on their future selves. If we think of a person as consisting of
multiple selves (the present self who wishes to indulge in transient pleasures versus
the future self who wishes to be healthy, as we assume in our model), the present
self’s choices can force externalities on the future self. Those within-person
externalities are known as ‘‘internalities’’ (Whitman 2006). Individuals have a
systematic tendency to pay too little attention to costs and beneﬁts of decisions to
their future selves. As a result, they engage in excessive amounts of certain
activities, such as eating—which is indeed one of the predictions of our model.
The harm resulting from an internality might be avoided in more than one way.
For instance, people can ﬁnd ways to negotiate with each other to exploit
4

Note that to prove the results we have assumed that the food price should be low enough (see Eqs. 3.4,
3.5) such that food consumption is above the threshold level that maximizes health. This has certainly
within a person can make deals; such deals are called ‘‘interpersonal bargains’’
(Whitman 2006).5 However, given the difﬁculty of internally enforcing those
bargains, or contracts, it stands to reason that people do not always succeed in
exercising self-control. This suggests a rationale for government interventions
aimed at addressing self-control problems to induce individuals to make better
health decisions. However, these policies should not prevent people from behaving
in their own best interests. Ideally, these policies should create beneﬁts for those
who do not make reliable decisions in their best interest while be harmless to those
that make reliable decisions.
In addition, if consumers do not have enough information to make informed
choices, or if they do not fully understand or accurately perceive the risks and
consequences of their choices, they may behave in a way that does not actually
match their preferences or maximize their welfare. For instance, they may choose
poor diets simply because they do not know which diets are healthy. This suggests
that private decision-making in health may lead to inefﬁcient outcomes and points
to a potential role for cost-effective policies.
It is worth noting that most of the interventions discussed in this subsection come
from the USA. Applying insights from these interventions into problems in LAC
countries is a promising area of research.
3.3.1 Information and knowledge
There is scarce evidence on policy interventions that attempt to reduce the
knowledge gap in the context of obesity. The main policy response has been to
enhance access to information, but despite the sound rationale underlying this
approach, the evidence supporting it is mixed at best.
A number of recent randomized control trials have found little conclusive
evidence that the provision of nutrition information can actually change consumer
behavior. Tandon et al. (2010) randomized the provision of information on the
nutrition content of McDonald’s meals to a group of 100 parents and found no
signiﬁcant difference in the caloric content of the meal selected. Harnack et al.
(2008) conducted a randomized 2 9 2 factorial experiment in which 594
participants ordered a fast-food meal from one of four menus that varied with
respect to whether calorie information was provided and whether value-size pricing
was used.6 The results showed that providing calorie information at the point of
purchase had little effect on food selection and consumption.
In contrast, Roberto et al. (2010) found some impact on behavior when
participants in a study dinner (n = 303) were randomly assigned to either (1) a
5

All of us face self-control problems from time to time. Whitman (2006) argues that we can ﬁnd ways to
solve, or at least mitigate, those problems. One way is to make deals with ourselves. For instance, we can
reward ourselves for good behavior and punish ourselves for bad behavior, make promises and advertise
them to friends and families, or make commitments to change our own behavior.

Value-size pricing involves structuring product prices such that the per unit cost decreases as the
portion size increases. It has been speculated that this product pricing structure leads to greater intake
calorie labels and a label stating the recommended daily caloric intake for an
average adult (calorie labels plus information). Participants assigned to the calorie
label group consumed less than the no calorie labels group at the dinner, but
compensated by overconsuming in the period following the meal. The group that
received both the nutrition information and dietary recommendations consumed less
than the other groups.
There are at least two reasons why improving access to information may be
insufﬁcient to promote weight loss or improve diet. First, overeating often stems
from self-control problems that occur despite full knowledge of consequences
(O’Donoghue and Rabin 2000). Second, several informational interventions look at
behaviors without evaluating whether the information is absorbed and understood.
As our model describes, individuals lag in their knowledge behind best practice
techniques. Therefore, there might be a gap between what is recommended and the
techniques actually used by people. When people do not understand the underlying
process and cannot easily infer the beneﬁts of a particular behavior, the transmission
of information might be ineffective. To understand the beneﬁts of health inputs,
people would have to understand the complex biological process that determines
health risks and the role that using health inputs plays in altering those processes.
For instance, Hawthorne at al. (2006) suggest that skills for using nutritional
information must be built up before the information provided can be effectively
used. In this vein, Prina and Royer (2013) measured the effect of delivering body
weight report cards to parents of elementary school students on parental knowledge,
obesity-related attitudes and behaviors, and BMI. In this experiment, children were
randomized into a control group and three treatment groups. What distinguished the
three treatment groups was the received level of information. The authors found that
weight report cards are an effective means of transmitting obesity information to
parents, since they became more informed. However, they found no changes in
parents’ action and self-reported behaviors as a result of having that increased
information. Nor did they ﬁnd any detectable effects on BMI or weight. The authors
suggest that to observe meaningful behavioral changes, it is necessary that parental
concerns about obesity change. Overall, these results show that the provision of
weight report cards is simply not enough to induce behavioral changes, despite the
positive effects on parental information.
Another way to deliver information is through targeted counseling and outreach
to populations at risk of becoming obese. These interventions can be quite diverse,
and their effectiveness in inﬂuencing dietary behavior may depend on programmatic
features such as setting (primary care facilities versus other types of facilities),
community-based group or individual counseling, interview style (e.g., motivational), and medium of communication (e.g., tailored feedback through e-mail). The
interventions discussed here involve programs that have some element of personal
contact and tailoring. These programs can also be combined with behavioral
interventions, which are strategies to help people acquire skills, motivation, and
support to change diet and exercise patterns. Indeed, behavioral economics suggests
that feedback on one’s progress toward achieving a goal can increase both
trial that tested the role of feedback through SMS messages found that daily
messages enhanced adherence to self-monitoring and increased weight loss (Burke
et al. 2012).
Several randomized control trials have demonstrated that these types of programs
can be an effective way to improve dietary consumptions and weight loss. Tailoring
has generally been found to be more successful than nontailored methods in
changing dietary behavior (Campbell et al. 1994; Delichatsios et al. 2001; Kristal
et al. 2000). In a study conducted by Tuomilehto et al. (2001), participants were
randomly assigned to one group that received individualized counseling aimed at
reducing weight, increasing physical activity, and participating in sessions with
nutritionists (intervention group), and another group that only received general
information about diet and exercise (control group). They found that the net weight
loss of the intervention group was 3.5 ± 5.5 kg while that of the control group was
0.8 ± 4.4 kg. Hardcastle et al. (2008) conducted a randomized trial to compare a
counseling intervention with a more standard intervention (a health promotion
leaﬂet) among 334 mostly obese patients. Individuals were randomized into either
an intervention group that received standard exercise and nutrition information plus
up to ﬁve face-to-face counseling sessions over 6 months, or into a control group
that only received the standard information. The results showed that in the sixth
month, participants in the intervention group were more active, particularly with
respect to walking, and had reduced weight, blood pressure and cholesterol, but had
not changed their diet, compared with the control group.
Increasingly, cost-conscious providers are exploring ways to deliver tailored
interventions that do not incur the same substantial costs as personal sessions. Some
examples of these interventions include messaging by telephone, e-mail, and SMS,
and computer-assisted counseling. In particular, interventions using telephone
counseling have seen signiﬁcant improvements in diet, physical activity, and weight
loss. Furthermore, these outcomes were more likely to be maintained over time. In a
study by Patrick et al. (2009), participants were randomly assigned to one of two
recipient groups over 16 weeks: (1) one group that received monthly printed
materials about weight control (comparison group); and (2) a second group that was
subject to an intervention that included personalized SMS and MMS messages sent
two to ﬁve times daily, printed materials, and brief monthly phone calls from a
health counselor (intervention group). The results showed that at the end of
4 months, the intervention group lost more weight than the comparison group.
3.3.2 Present bias and behavioral economics
Policies addressing consumer behavior will not achieve a ﬁrst-best outcome if they
do not account for consumers’ time inconsistency. Our model shows that consumers
with time-inconsistent preferences may well spend more than is optimal on food
and, in consequence, make suboptimal decisions. Time-inconsistent consumers will
have a demand for commitment mechanisms that can be used to induce more
appropriate behavior in the present. Unfortunately, the private market only
exercise routine.
In light of the ﬁndings that people regularly deviate from a rational model of
behavior, and that such deviations can hurt their own long-term interests, behavioral
economics has focused on developing interventions that expressly take such
decision-making tendencies into account. Behavioral economists have proposed a
new approach—termed ‘‘libertarian paternalistic’’—that operates via ‘‘nudging’’
individual behavior toward self-interest. The libertarian descriptor refers to the fact
that individuals should be allowed to make their own choices. The essence of this
approach is that the same decision errors that often result in people inadvertently
harming themselves can instead help them by rearranging the details of their
decisions without formally restricting or otherwise signiﬁcantly altering their choice
sets (Luoto and Carman 2014).
Along these lines, Downs et al. (2009, 2010) proposed an intervention to deal
with present-biased preferences as well as the status quo bias. The intervention
included the design of a menu featuring healthy options on the front page of a menu
and unhealthy options at the back. Speciﬁcally, participants were instructed to select
a sandwich from a menu that varied in terms of providing (or not) caloric
recommendations and information as well as the relative convenience of healthy
sandwich options. The convenience manipulation played on present-bias preferences by adding a small and immediate additional cost to ﬁnding the unhealthy
options (having to open the menu to the back), which in theory should make the
relative costs and beneﬁts of the healthy and unhealthy options more equal. The
results suggested that highlighting the healthy options can improve people’s choices
to select more healthy fare. Those who received the menu highlighting healthy fare
were 48 % more likely to purchase a low-calorie sandwich relative to the standard
menu that had a mix of healthy and unhealthy options. This study further tested the
ability of caloric information to affect orders and found no effect.
Another way to ‘‘nudge’’ people to make better dietary choices is by providing
ﬁnancial incentives.7 These incentives can potentially increase the perceived beneﬁt
of substituting healthier foods in the long term, in this way lessening the bias toward
present preferences. An alternative hypothesis is that motivation encourages ‘‘habit
formation.’’ In other words, providing incentives to healthy behaviors such as
exercising may increase the future utility of such behaviors. If the marginal utility of
consumption today is positively correlated with historical consumption, then the
period in which people were given ﬁnancial incentives to go to the gym could also
induce them to go to the gym more often in the future, leading to habit formation
(Charness and Gneezy 2009). However, studies indicate that, in some situations,
providing rewards may be counterproductive, as providing an extrinsic motivation
for a task or activity may crowd out intrinsic motivation (Fishbach and Trope 2005;
Lepper et al. 1973; Deci 1972).
7

Certain interventions could be viewed as neoclassical or behavioral, depending on the context. One
could argue that ﬁnancial incentives are clearly in the realm of neoclassical economics. However,
incentives can also be used to address behavioral biases, either by raising the salience of a desired
behavior or by addressing issues of self-control. In such instances, the incentives can be classiﬁed also as
lotteries. Consistent with prospect theory, a small probability of a large reward may
be more motivating than a certain award of the same expected value (Luoto and
Carman 2014).
Commitment mechanisms are another way to help address the problem of time
inconsistency. Broadly, a commitment mechanism is an arrangement entered into by
an individual with the aim of helping fulﬁll a plan for future behavior that would
otherwise be difﬁcult owing to intrapersonal conﬂict stemming from, for example, a
lack of self-control (Bryan et al. 2010). An example of a commitment mechanism
would be the payment of a gym membership by the month rather than by the day to
increase the cost of skipping a session. These types of mechanisms can be used to
help address the problem of time inconsistency by allowing a present self to make
decisions on behalf of its future self in cases when the two selves may differ in their
preferences.
The empirical literature regarding the provision of ﬁnancial incentives and
commitment mechanisms among obese people suggests that such incentives can be
effective in promoting dietary change in the short term. For instance, Volpp et al.
(2008) conducted a randomized control trial that involved the assignment of healthy
volunteers to one of three types of programs: (1) a weight-monitoring program
involving monthly weigh-ins, which acted as the control group; (2) the same
program with one of two ﬁnancial incentive plans in the form of a lottery
(participants who met the weight loss target had a 1 in 5 chance each day of winning
a small reward, and a 1 in 100 chance of winning a large reward); and (3) standard
treatment plus a commitment contract (participants put their own money at risk,
which they would lose if they failed to lose weight). The results showed that the
incentive group lost signiﬁcantly more weight than the control group after
16 weeks. However, behavior reverted back to almost exactly what it was initially
once the incentives were dropped, and substantial weight was regained. Finkelstein
et al. (2007) found that, over a 3-month period, participants offered $14 per
percentage point of weight loss lost 4.7 pounds, and participants offered $7 per
percentage point of weight loss lost 3 pounds compared with 2 pounds among
control group participants (see Wall et al. 2006 for a systematic review).
There is also literature on ﬁnancial incentives for gym attendance. Charness and
Gneezy (2009) conducted two randomized ﬁeld experiments that offered incentives
for university students to attend a gym a number of times during 1 month. In the
ﬁrst experiment, they compared the behavior of three groups. All groups were given
a handout regarding the beneﬁts of exercise. One group received no beneﬁts; people
in the other two groups were paid $25 to attend the gym once in a week, and people
in one of these two groups were then paid an additional $100 to attend the gym eight
more times in the following 4 weeks. In the second experiment, people were invited
to a ﬁrst meeting in which biometric measures were taken and handouts distributed
regarding the beneﬁts of exercise. Participants were paid $75 for attending and were
then invited to come twice more. They were promised $50 for each of the two later
meetings. They were randomly assigned to three groups: one with no additional
requirements, a second that required attending the gym once during the 1-month
gym eight times in a month, as the rate of gym visits after the intervention increased
signiﬁcantly in both experiments. The study also found improvements in health
indicators such as weight, waist size, and pulse rate. The authors concluded that
merely providing information about the beneﬁts of exercise or even requiring one
gym visit did not have much of an effect.
Using a ﬁeld intervention to exogenously shift preferences toward gym
attendance in a student sample, Acland and Levy (2013) conﬁrmed the results
found by Charness and Gneezy (2009)—that is, people do establish a signiﬁcant
exercise habit, but only in the short run.
Several longer term studies, such as studies by Kramer et al. (1986) and Jeffery
and Wing (1995), did not ﬁnd any effects on weight loss among study participants
after 30 months of treatment. Furthermore, a meta-analysis of nine studies
conducted by Paul-Ebhohimhen and Avenell (2008) found no signiﬁcant effect of
ﬁnancial incentives on weight loss or maintenance at 12 and 18 months.
In sum, empirical evidence seems to suggest that once incentives are taken away,
individuals are likely to return to their normal behavior, exhibiting bounded
willpower and ignoring the future beneﬁts of healthy behaviors. Future research
should examine ways to use incentives to induce long-term weight loss and
maintenance. This challenge is not unique to ﬁnancial incentive-based programs; it
is a challenge for weight-loss programs in general.
3.3.3 Price interventions
Government could turn to second-best policies that involve ‘‘sin’’ taxes and
subsidies to address these biases and discourage the consumption of unhealthy food.
In this case, the intervention could be warranted, on the one hand, by the damage
that being overweight or obese does to the individuals themselves (Gruber 2002).
The individual’s long-run self recognizes that he or she will overeat and would like
to reduce consumption of food. But without the help of government or a legal
commitment mechanism, the person’s current self is unable to do so. On the other
hand, obese individuals have more expensive healthcare costs for which they do not
fully pay. Instead these costs are shared among all of those in a common insurance
market. A tax would force obese individuals to bear the full cost of their unhealthy
habits and would correct the externality they currently impose on others (Luoto and
Carman 2014). Unfortunately, when the population is heterogeneous and a large
group makes reliable decisions in their best interest, this type of intervention would
be harmful to them.
‘‘Sin’’ taxes are designed to induce people to make better personal health
decisions. By raising the price of the unhealthy item, government can make the
overconsumption of food more costly for today’s self, helping achieve what the
individual’s long-term self would desire by decreasing the consumption of food
today. O’Donoghue and Rabin (2003) discuss ‘‘optimal sin taxes’’ designed to
correct self-control problems, using the speciﬁc example of overeating. They show
that imposing seemingly large sin taxes on unhealthy items while lowering taxes on
overconsume the unhealthy items due to self-control problems.
In general, the empirical literature documents that lowering the price of healthy
foods and raising the price of less-healthy alternatives have the potential to
inﬂuence purchases toward healthier food options, particularly when large
purchases are involved (Powell and Chaloupka 2009).8 For instance, Cecchini
et al. (2010) used a simulation based on pricing studies to predict that changes in
relative prices between healthy and unhealthy foods lead to reductions in fat
consumption by 0.4–0.6 % and increases in ﬁber consumption by 3.6–10.4 %.
Using a laboratory experiment, Epstein et al. (2010) examined the effects of
increasing the price of high-calorie-for-nutrient foods or reducing the price of lowcalorie-for-nutrient foods by 12.5 and 25 %, respectively, on mothers’ purchases of
68 common foods and drinks. They found that taxing less-healthy foods with lownutrient density-reduced caloric intake and reduced the proportion of fat while
increasing the proportion of protein purchased.
Despite this suggestive evidence, there are few studies that have attempted to
measure the effects of taxation on health outcomes. One exception is the study by
Miljkovic and Nganje (2008) that shows that a $1 increase in the price of sugar is
associated with a 0.20 and 0.33 percentage point reduction in the probability of
being overweight or obese, respectively (see also Powell et al. 2007).
There are some caveats that should be taken into account when these policies are
analyzed. First, people may respond to the price change by substituting the taxed
unhealthy item with another unhealthy item that is not included in the policy.
Fletcher et al. (2010) investigated the potential of soft drink taxes to combat rising
levels of adolescent obesity. Their results suggest that taxation leads to a moderate
reduction in soft drink consumption, but that this reduction is completely offset by
increases in consumption of other high-calorie drinks. Schroeter et al. (2008) shows
that there are plausible scenarios where taxes on certain types of food (e.g., food
away from home) could lead to increases in body weight simply due to substitution
among types of food. Second, if people do not understand the risk of obesity, these
kinds of policies may be less successful because of unintended consequences. For
example, Waterlander et al. (2012) found that although offering subsidies on healthy
foods increases the amounts purchased, the proportion of healthy foods to total
purchases remained unchanged, as people used those savings to purchase more
calories overall.
In sum, while evidence has revealed increases in purchases of healthier foods
when the prices of such foods are reduced, as well as reductions in purchases of
less-healthy foods when their prices are increased, more research is needed on the
impact of these policies on health outcomes and on what pricing strategies would be
optimal for addressing excess food consumption and rising rates of obesity. For
example, if the goal is to decrease caloric intake, is it better to subsidize healthy
foods, tax unhealthy foods, or implement both a tax and a subsidy policy? This
answer remains unknown.

Experience with tobacco tax regulation further underscores the power of price changes to inﬂuence
According to demographic and epidemiological transitions, LAC has become
increasingly vulnerable to the impact of NCDs. Improved access to healthcare, early
detection, and timely treatment constitute an effective approach to reducing the
impact of NCDs (Alwan 2011). In this context, the provision of health insurance
plays an important role. This section focuses on health insurance programs, ﬁrst
discussing the rationales for creating health insurance programs and then brieﬂy
setting out the choices that deﬁne particular health insurance programs.
4.1 The rationale of health insurance
Health is a person’s multidimensional state of physical and psychological wellbeing. The health that people can expect to experience in any given year is a
function of their health stock, the probabilities with which they are hit by health
shocks, and the nature and quality of the healthcare they would receive. Health
shocks are a troubling source of risk for all households because if such shocks come
to pass, households must either obtain care and pay high out-of-pocket fees or forgo
care and suffer the physical and economic consequences of ill health.
Some households attempt to protect themselves against the burden of future
health shocks by purchasing health insurance, which is a contract where the
household agrees to pay a fee or premium in exchange for the promise of
indemnities, or ﬁnancial assistance with paying healthcare bills, when a family
member experience a covered health shock. For households with the ﬁnancial means
to pay for care when hit by shocks, such contracts reduce vulnerability to ﬁnancial
shocks and poverty. For those who would have forgone care when hit by health
shocks, such contracts improve their health by allowing them to obtain healthcare.
If insurance markets were free of information problems and if insurance
transactions were costless to carry out, insurers would come forward to supply
health insurance to many households while charging premiums that households are
willing to pay. They could supply insurance at such premiums while covering costs,
because they would beneﬁt from risk pooling.9 The existence of a well-functioning
health insurance market would allow for a redistribution of income from those who
remain healthy to those who become sick, while leaving everyone better off because
even those who ultimately remain healthy would beneﬁt (ex ante) from reduced risk.
However, markets are unlikely to yield high-quality and efﬁcient healthcare in
the absence of intervention for several reasons. Most households may not be
sufﬁciently forward-looking, so the cost of possible out-of-pocket healthcare
expenditures receives little weight in current consumption decisions. They also lack
expert medical knowledge and thus have much less information than providers
about the quality and necessity of the care provided. Providers might take advantage
of this asymmetry of information by charging high fees for low-quality care, and
ﬁnancial market limitations can render it difﬁcult for healthcare providers to
9

Insurers engage in risk pooling when they take on liability for the cost of any necessary healthcare for
demands for care and inﬂows of user-fee revenue. Failure of insurance markets may,
therefore, be understood as contributing to two critical symptoms of the failure of
the healthcare system in the absence of intervention: low rates of healthcare
utilization and high rates of impoverishment among those who obtain care.
The logic of health insurance market failures suggests that where households
must pay signiﬁcant user fees for healthcare, governments may be able to increase
healthcare utilization and reduce the ﬁnancial burden associated with care by
introducing new health insurance programs (Schaffner 2013). As always, while
logic suggests the potential for health insurance programs to generate beneﬁts at low
cost, it does not guarantee that in practice the beneﬁts will be large and the cost low.
The nature and magnitude of the impact of such programs are likely to depend on
the details of program design, as will be discussed in the following subsection.
4.2 Design of health insurance programs
Health insurance programs have the potential to improve healthcare quality and
efﬁciency by creating a new institutional interface between healthcare consumers
and suppliers, which improves the governance of healthcare management. The new
institutional arrangements can help healthcare consumers coordinate their demands
and negotiate better contractual arrangements. Further efﬁciency gains may be
obtained when health insurance programs encourage households to make more
efﬁcient use of the healthcare system. For instance, by covering primary care visits,
health insurance can encourage households to enter the healthcare system at an
earlier stage of illness, when treatment is more effective and less costly (Schaffner
2013).
However, the potential beneﬁts of health insurance programs depend on the
details of the program design. Health insurance programs differ greatly in their
coverage. Some programs offer coverage for catastrophic health shocks that are lifethreatening and require hospitalization or costly medication. Other programs offer
coverage for the smaller and more frequent costs of primary healthcare services,
including the diagnosis and treatment of common illnesses.
Within any category of covered health shocks and treatments, the generosity of
coverage is deﬁned by deductibles, coinsurance rates, and caps on out-of-pocket
spending or indemnity payments. In some programs, participants must pay out-ofpocket for healthcare costs up to speciﬁed deductible levels (per health shock
episode or per year)10 before additional costs are covered by indemnities, Other
programs offer ﬁrst dollar coverage (i.e., zero deductible). Very generous programs
might cover 100 % of healthcare costs beyond the deductible level, while others
might cover only 60 %, thereby imposing a 40 % coinsurance rate on participants.
Some programs impose per-episode out-of-pocket payments caps, promising to
cover any costs in excess of that cap, while others impose insurer payment caps,
requiring participants to cover any cost over the cap. In addition, programs differ in
10
Deductible levels are minimum amounts of expenditure that the insured person must bear before the
levels or demographic characteristics.
A ﬁnal distinguishing design feature is whether participation is mandatory or
voluntary. Many of the oldest health insurance programs in developing countries are
mandatory for all formal sector workers (and their families). The mandate is
enforced using payroll taxes to deduct premiums before workers receive their pay.
In LAC, mandatory programs were introduced as far back as the 1930s and cover
over half of the population (see Sect. 5). In poorer countries, however, very few
people work in the formal sector, and mandatory programs might cover as little as
10 % of the population. In programs targeting the many developing-country
households outside the formal sector, participation is voluntary (Schaffner 2013).

5 Institutional overview of health insurance programs in Latin America
and the Caribbean
The organization and supply of health insurance varies widely across countries.
While most high-income countries have evolved toward the public provision of
health insurance, attained near-universal coverage and increased the degree of
ﬁnancial risk protection, access to care and risk protection in middle-income
countries remains a policy concern. In these countries, targeted safety net programs
complement a small private insurance market, limiting coverage to selected beneﬁts
and groups. Private insurance markets are generally fragmented, and the use of
regulatory instruments, such as risk adjustment, remains limited (McGuire 2012).
Regarding LAC, most countries have reformed their healthcare system. These
reforms have been focused mainly on promoting ﬁnancial, structural, and
institutional changes in health systems while much less attention has been devoted
to enhancing the performance of health systems with the focus on reducing
inequities in health conditions and access to healthcare (PAHO 2002, 138). In a
large majority of countries, a tripartite healthcare system has emerged with diverse
roles of the public, social insurance, and private sectors, varying degrees of
population coverage and separation of functions (Mesa-Lago 2008).
Social insurance plays an important role in the provision of health insurance in
the region. Its design is based on the Bismarck model, where social insurance
entitlements are proportional to the mandatory contributions made by workers and
their employers (Ribe et al. 2012). Under this design, the coverage is limited by the
method of ﬁnancing. While all workers are exposed to the risks, even under full
compliance, only those in the formal sector are actually insured; hence, selfemployed workers and those engaged with ﬁrms under nonsalaried contracts are left
out (Levy 2008).
`
The public sector plays a secondary role vis-a-vis social insurance, as it has
insufﬁcient resources and limited access, and provides low-quality services. Finally,
there is a signiﬁcant variety of private entities and plans partly because health
reforms have stimulated the expansion and competition of the private sector.

Lat Am Econ Rev (2015) 24:11

private insurance ﬁrms and providers practice risk selection (cream skimming),
excluding or charging higher premiums to those who either suffer chronic
diseases or are elderly, and as a consequence those enduring greater risk must
pay higher copayments that they often cannot afford;
competition is centered on the most attractive groups and avoids the least
attractive groups—including the elderly or people with high risk, chronic
disease, or insufﬁcient income to ﬁnance needs derived from their epidemiological proﬁle—who are left to the public sector;
segmentation increases in countries where social insurance is not integrated
with the public sector and only covers the middle-income formal stratum
(Mesa-Lago 2008; Giordano and Colina 2000).

5.1 Health insurance coverage
Although the region lacks historical statistical series’ on coverage, Table 6, based on
Mesa-Lago (2008), compiles estimates of the percentage of the total population covered
in 19 countries. Whenever possible, the table compares the year prior to the reforms with
the most recent year available. In the table, the covered population is divided into the three
sectors (public, social insurance, and private) and the category of ‘‘others’’ (separate
schemes such as the armed forces, policemen, civil servants, etc.). Since several problems
affect the accuracy of the estimates, results should be interpreted with caution.
Considering the region as a whole, the estimated regional weighted average of the
total population covered by social insurance before and after the reform (excluding the
public systems of Brazil and Cuba) increased from 43 to 52 % from 1980 to 1990 but
decreased to 41 % in 2001. These averages are below the International Labor
Organization’s (ILO) minimum norm of 75 % coverage of the resident population.
However, an undetermined portion of the population has access to public sector
services, and to a lesser extent is covered by the private sector (3.8 % of the
population) and the ‘‘other’’ category of systems mentioned in the previous paragraph.
The population covered with social insurance varies widely within the region.
There are countries that cover almost the entire population (up to 86 %) through
social insurance, but there are others where social insurance covers only a small
minority, ranging from 0.5 % in Haiti to 16 % in Uruguay. The low health coverage
in some countries may be attributed to legal or practical exclusion of the selfemployed, agricultural workers, and informal workers. Hence, the degree of
coverage is directly related to both the level of socioeconomic development and the
proportion of the labor force that is formal, whereas it is inversely related to poverty
incidence (Mesa-Lago 2008).
The public sector does not often fulﬁll the legal mandate of free service to the
poor and uninsured in most LAC countries, so a signiﬁcant part of the population is
left without protection. In terms of private out-of-pocket expenditure in health as a
share of national health expenditure, the regional average of around 48 % in 2011 is
still far from the target of 23 %, which is the level of countries in the Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development characterized as having universal

Nonsalaried and informal workers represent a major challenge for social health
insurance, since under contributory social insurance there is no possibility of
extending coverage to them precisely because they are outside the formal sector.
Over the last two decades some LAC countries have gradually created programs to
provide the uninsured with at least a subset of health beneﬁts adjusted to the
epidemiological and local needs of users (see Sect. 7).
In sum, over the past three decades the region has seen important reforms that
sought to improve health systems. However, the norm is still mixed and fragmented
models in which contributory and noncontributory health insurance programs
coexist. One of the implications of this situation is low ﬁnancial protection for
individuals. In addition, the increase in informal labor poses great challenges to
achieving universal healthcare coverage. This is especially relevant taking into
account the high prevalence of NCDs, which require effective health insurance
programs that provide coverage for long-term treatment.

6 The coverage of health insurance: a theoretical framework
As previously mentioned, since the second half of the twentieth century the trend in
LAC has been toward labor-based social insurance systems restricted to salaried
labor market.
In most of the informality literature, workers’ decisions play no role in
determining the equilibrium in the labor market. Galiani and Weinschelbaum (2012)
provide a model where workers have nonpecuniary preferences for the sector in
which they work. Part of these nonpecuniary preferences is health insurance plans
provided by formal ﬁrms. We assume that formal workers are covered by health
insurance and informal workers are not. Informal workers can access healthcare
resorting to either private health insurance or public hospitals. Thus, any policy that
affects workers’ health insurance may produce changes in workers’ behaviour,
affecting the size of the formal sector and consequently the quantity of workers
covered by insurance.
Speciﬁcally, Galiani and Weinschelbaum (2012) assume that ﬁrms produce a
homogenous good that is traded in a perfectly competitive market using managerial
talent (m) and homogenous units of labor (l). In the model, very small ﬁrms (i.e.,
those with managerial talent m close to 0) operate informally because of the ﬁxed
cost that they would have to incur to operate formally. As result, there is size
dualism: small ﬁrms operate informally while large ﬁrms operate formally. In
equilibrium, whenever there are both formal and informal ﬁrms, there is a unique

cutoff point (m) that satisﬁes:


Pf ðmÞ ¼ Pi ðmÞ;
where Pf and Pi are the beneﬁts perceived by the formal and informal ﬁrm,

respectively. Thus, ﬁrms with managerial talent m m choose to operate informally,

while ﬁrms with managerial talent m [ m choose to operate formally. (The complete derivation of the model is in Appendix 2.)
Each worker, endowed with l units of homogenous labor, has to choose whether
to sell his or her labor to a ﬁrm that operates either formally or informally.11 In the
ﬁrst case, workers receive wf per unit of labor plus mandated social beneﬁts, which
for simplicity sake we equate to health insurance package ðHI). In the second case,
workers receive only wi per unit of labor and we assume they receive healthcare
only in public hospitals ðPH). In addition, we assume that UðHI) [ UðPH):
The utility of a worker who chooses to work in the formal sector is:
Uf ðwf l; HIÞ ¼ wf l þ HI À c;
where c is a ﬁxed cost for working in the formal sector, such as unemployment
insurance.
The expected utility of a worker who chooses to work in the informal sector is:

11

Olson (1993), cited in Gruber (2000), provides supportive evidence of the presence of worker’s selfselection in the USA. He ﬁnds that workers with greater-than-expected health needs (e.g., wives whose
husbands do not have health insurance, and who have less-healthy children) self-select into ﬁrms that
where q is the probability that a ﬁrm is caught operating informally, in which case
workers do not receive their payment.
Under certain conditions there is a unique cutoff point ( that determines that
l)
workers with low levels of human capital will work in the informal sector and those
with high levels of human capital will be employed in the formal sector. This cutoff
point is determined by:
Uf ðwf  HIÞ ¼ Ui ðwi PHÞ;
l;
l;
and solving for  we obtain:
l
¼

Workers with l [  prefer to work in the formal sector, while workers with l 
l
l
operate informally (see Appendix 2 for further details). This is the ﬁrst important
result in terms of health:
Result 1 Poor, unskilled workers will be in the informal sector and will only have
public health coverage, while workers with high levels of human capital will be
employed in the formal sector and receive health insurance.12
The equilibrium analysis is restricted to the cases where there are ﬁrms and
workers operating in both the formal and informal sectors. An equilibrium is then a
vector of wages ðwf ; wi Þ, supply of labor ðlS ; lS Þ; and demand for labor (lD ; lD ) such
f i
f
i
that there is market clearing in both the formal ðf Þ and informal ðiÞ labor markets.
We will analyze the effect of an improvement in health insurance package that
formal worker receives, which is reﬂected by an increase in HI. At the prevailing
wage levels, the utility of working in the formal sector increases while the utility of
working in the informal sector remains constant. This, in turn, will reduce the
formality cutoff point for workers (in Eq. 6.1, (PH À HI) decreases); hence more
individuals would prefer to work in the formal sector. Thus, the curve of equilibrium
points in the formal sector ðlD ¼ lS Þ shifts downward, while the curve of equilibrium
f
f
points in the informal sector ðlD ¼ lS Þ shifts to the right. Since the total supply of
i
i
labor represented by workers above the original cutoff point increases, at the
prevailing wage levels there is an excess supply in the formal sector. This means
that, for a given informal wage, equilibrium in the formal sector is only achieved if
formal wages go down. The same reasoning applies to the informal sector. Finally,
since neither the total supply of labor (the total quantity of labor is supplied
inelastically) nor the total demand of labor has changed, the function ðlD þ lS ¼
f
f
lD þ lS Þ representing the wage levels that align the total supply of labor with total
i
i
demand for labor remains the same.
We illustrate these changes in Fig. 2, where the downward sloping curve
represents the locus of wages where total labor demand is equal to total labor

composition is not. Each point maps to a different ðlD ; lS ; lD ; lS Þ vector. The upward

In the new equilibrium ðwÃÃ ; wÃÃ Þ the informal wage increases while the formal
f
i
wage decreases. Thus, this policy would indirectly beneﬁt informal workers through
the increase in their wages. Managerial decisions also change. At the new wage
levels, the managerial ability cutoff point is also lower than in the previous
equilibrium. Therefore, more ﬁrms choose to operate formally. Moreover, the ﬁrms
that originally were operating formally increase their total labor demand while those
that remain in the informal sector reduce their total labor demand. Thus, we have the
following result:
Result 2 An improvement in health insurance package increases the size of the
formal sector, decreases the formal wage, and increases the informal wage, thus
improving the utility of poor unskilled workers who choose the informal sector.
An increase in the quality of public hospitals,14 represented by an increase in PH,
will also affect the market labor. At the initial wage levels, the utility of working in
the informal sector increases while the utility of working in the formal sector
remains constant, which increases the formality cutoff point for workers (in Eq. 6.1,
PH À HI increases); hence more individuals would prefer to work in the informal
13
The assumption that the derivative of total labor demand with respect to wages is negative guarantees
that the curve is downward sloping.

This also can be interpreted as an expansion of the beneﬁts or the coverage provided by public

the left and the curve of equilibrium points in the formal sector ðlD ¼ lS Þ shifts

upward. Since the total supply of labor represented by workers below the original
cutoff point increases, at the prevailing wage levels there is an excess supply in the
informal sector. For a given formal wage, equilibrium in the informal sector is only
achieved if informal wages decrease. The same reasoning applies to the formal
sector. At the new wage levels, the managerial ability cutoff point is higher than in
the previous equilibrium, hence the size of the informal sector increases. In sum, we
obtain the following result:
Result 3 An increase in the quality of public hospitals, which reduces the
difference in health services that formal workers received through social health
insurance relative to uninsured informal workers, increases the size of the informal
sector and decreases the wages of this sector, while increasing the wages of the
formal sector.
This simple model shows that employment-based health insurance interferes with
the functioning of the labor market. This is a relevant result for policymakers, since
changes in the provision of public healthcare may have unintended consequences,
distorting workers’ incentives to operate in the informal sector.

7 The challenges of expanding health insurance coverage
As the magnitude of NCDs continues to accelerate, the pressing need for access to
quality healthcare is increasingly recognized. There are three ways of moving
toward increasing ﬁnancial accessibility to healthcare: (1) by increasing breadth
(who is insured), (2) by increasing depth (which beneﬁts are covered), and (3) by
increasing height (what proportion of the cost is covered). This subsection
investigates the ﬁrst approach to increasing accessibility, which involves expanding
health insurance to poor, unskilled workers in the informal sector.
LAC countries face the challenge of expanding health insurance coverage in a
scenario in which a large share of the labor force is employed in the informal sector.
There is little agreement among countries as to how best to expand coverage to this
sector. Under social health insurance there is no possibility of extending coverage to
nonsalaried workers. As a result, separate insurance programs adjusted to
epidemiological needs should be available for those persons who are not eligible
for health insurance through employment.
Over the years, and particularly since the mid-1990s, governments have
gradually created programs to provide the uninsured with at least a subset of the
beneﬁts that salaried workers receive through social health insurance. These health
programs have expanded markedly in scope, quality, budget, and coverage.
One of the most notable initiatives is Mexico’s Seguro Popular. Mexico’s social
security system only covers about 45 % of the population, namely formally
registered wage workers and their dependents (Aterido and Hallward-Driemeier
2011). Seguro Popular was introduced in 2002 with the aim of expanding health
beneﬁciaries pay to participate in the program. By the end of 2010, the uninsured
population had dropped to 9 million people (from 64 million in 2002) representing
only 8 % of the population (Bitran 2014). A study that summarizes results from all
published evaluations concluded that Seguro Popular improved access to health
services and reduced the prevalence of catastrophic and impoverishing health
expenditures, especially for the poor (Knaul et al. 2012).
Another example of increasing access is Colombia’s reform that has sought to
expand health insurance coverage by creating two regimes, a contributory regime
for the nonpoor and a subsidized regime for the poor.15 Afﬁliation in the
contributory regime is mandatory for dependent and independent workers whose
monthly income is greater than a legal threshold, while individuals with an income
below that threshold have to enroll in the subsidized regime. Beneﬁts in the
subsidized regime are ﬁnanced with 1 percentage point contribution by the afﬁliates
of the contributory regime plus subsidies from the nation’s Treasury. This move
toward a subsidized national health insurance system made it possible for Colombia
to achieve universal health coverage by 2009 (Bitran 2014). Furthermore, there is
evidence that the reform improved access to healthcare and ﬁnancial protection
against health shocks for beneﬁciaries (Giedion et al. 2009).
Peru complemented its social health insurance program, which covers formal
workers, with a voluntary Integral Health Insurance Program (Seguro Integral de
Salud—SIS) that covers poor and low-income individuals working in the informal
sector. Families wishing to qualify are subject to a means test, known as the
Household Targeting System. The SIS is ﬁnanced by general revenues of the
government. By the end of 2010, the proportion of uninsured Peruvians dropped
from two-thirds to one-third. However, it is important to note that expanding
nominal coverage may not necessarily lead to bridging gaps in access to health
services. In Peru, these gaps persist and are large (Bitran 2014).
Other developing countries have also applied this strategy. For instance, Vietnam
has recognized that expanding coverage based on contributory mechanisms alone is
not feasible in a context where a large share of the population is still poor, in the
informal sector, or both (Somanathan et al. 2012). Vietnam’s Health Insurance Law
of 2008 mandated enrollment of all citizens in the country’s social health insurance
agency (SHI). With the aim of promoting enrollment, certain population groups,
including the poor, are not required to make any contribution to SHI. In addition, the
government subsidizes 70 % of a ﬂat premium for the near-poor and 30 % for
medium-income farmers. Nearly 60 % of the country’s population was covered by
SHI by the end of 2010 (Bitran 2014).
Some health insurance programs are focused on speciﬁc population groups. For
instance, the Maternal-Child Health Insurance Program in Argentina, known as
Plan Nacer, has sought to reduce maternal and child mortality among uninsured
pregnant women and children through highly innovative result-based ﬁnancing
15
In 1990, Colombia adopted a new Constitution that emphasized social program spending for the poor.
Law 100 of 1993 reformed the social security system, including pensions, workplace accidents,
of the central pillars of a broader and integrated package of propoor policy reforms
intended to increase the availability of healthcare services for the uninsured. It
became a powerful tool in increasing coverage of basic services among the
uninsured population.
Another way to expand the coverage of health insurance involves public
provision of subsidized health insurance. Under this approach, insurance is
compulsory, so coverage extends to the entire population. All citizens have free
or nearly free access to healthcare at least in terms of facing zero or nearly zero
costs, regardless of whether they belong to the formal or informal sector. This
system is used in some high-income countries, including the UK, Denmark,
Norway, Australia, and New Zealand, and it predominates in some developing
countries. Probably the best known example of public provision of healthcare
services is the United Kingdom’s National Health Service, whose principal source
of ﬁnancing is general tax revenue. The National Health Service provides free care
or nearly free care to UK citizens regardless of whether they belong to the formal or
informal sector.
One of the ﬁrst LAC countries to adopt this strategy was Brazil. Starting in 1988,
Brazil abandoned its social health insurance system and created the tax-ﬁnanced
national health system (the Uniﬁed Health System—SUS), which provides
comprehensive healthcare to all Brazilians irrespective of income, location, age,
gender, or work status. The SUS uniﬁed the existing disparate contributory and
public subsystems into one coordinated national system for which the entire
population is eligible. A number of assessments of the SUS carried out over the
years have generally pointed to signiﬁcant achievements in improving access and
contributing to bringing Brazil from lagging behind its peers in terms of health
indicators to being a good performer (Couttolenc and Dmytraczenko 2013).
In the developing world, Thailand’s Universal Coverage Scheme stands out as a
widely publicized reform that sought to move away from the fragmented health
system, which included a social health insurance component, to an integrated
system ﬁnanced through general tax revenues. Prior to the reform, one-third of the
population lacked health insurance coverage, mostly informal sector workers. A
review by the Health Insurance System Research Ofﬁce (2012) reported that
impoverishment among informal sector workers dropped as a result of the universal
coverage reform. Health insurance coverage in Thailand is now universal (Bitran
2014).
For a more radical reform, Levy (2008) proposes converting existing systems of
social security for formal workers into universal social entitlements, in which health
insurance would be included. He advocates eliminating wage-based social security
contributions and raising consumption taxes on higher income households to
improve beneﬁts for workers, among other objectives.
Thus, in thinking about ways to provide health insurance to poor, unskilled
workers in the informal sector—who represent a large proportion of the workforce
in a context where NCDs are commonplace—social health insurance systems
Informality makes health insurance reform difﬁcult, while at the same time health
insurance reforms themselves may encourage informality because subsidized health
insurance programs can increase the size of the informal sector. In other words, the
coexistence of social health insurance programs with publicly subsidized health
insurance plans that cover poor, unskilled workers in the informal sector can
provide incentives for formal sector workers to switch to informal employment. By
doing so, workers can avoid having to make otherwise mandatory contributions to
the social health insurance system while receiving some free services under the new
program. However, there is scarce robust empirical evidence, based on randomized
control trials, of the actual effect of these programs on workers’ choices of formal or
informal employment in the region.
For instance, Camacho et al. (2009) examine whether publicly provided health
insurance in Colombia discouraged formal employment. Using a difference-indifference approach they found that informal employment was approximately 4
percentage points higher than it would have been in the absence of the reform.16 The
estimation includes year and municipality ﬁxed effects as well as individual,
household, and labor market controls.
A similar phenomenon seems to have occurred in Mexico. Aterido and HallwardDriemeier (2011) examine whether Mexico’s subsidized health insurance program
for the poor, Seguro Popular, had the unintended consequence of promoting
informal employment. Their identiﬁcation strategy relies on the variation in the
rollout of Seguro Popular across municipalities and time, with the difference-indifference estimation controlling for household ﬁxed effects. These authors ﬁnd that
the program lowers formality by 0.4–0.7 percentage points.
Thus, there appears to be a trade-off between the expansion of subsidized health
insurance programs and workers’ choices of informal employment. Given the high
rates of informality in LAC and the need to expand access to healthcare to the
uninsured, long-term evaluation of the impact of publicly subsidized health
insurance programs on the informal market is a research priority. Along these lines,
it is also crucial to assess the effects of these programs on health status. The
empirical evidence on the extent to which public health insurance programs improve
health outcomes is very limited (Sloan and Hsieh 2012).
A better understanding of the distortions generated by these programs and the
magnitude of their effects on both health status and informality is central to inform
policy decisions. Thus, a suggested area for research is on the way to use robust
experimental evidence to establish with conﬁdence the impact of subsidized health
insurance programs on labor informality and health.

The introduction of public health insurance programs may lead to moral hazard
problems, which refers to the effect of insurance on the behavior of the insured.
Ehrlich and Becker (1972) describe two different types of behavioral change,
namely ‘‘ex-post moral hazard’’ and ‘‘ex-ante moral hazard.’’ Ex-ante moral hazard
refers to the situation prior to the advent of illness; speciﬁcally, it describes the
phenomenon in which the insured engage less in preventive behaviors because the
cost of treating illness is lower with insurance coverage. Ex post moral hazard, by
way of contrast, comes into play once the health loss has already occurred. At this
stage, individuals increase consumption of healthcare because health insurance has
reduced the price of healthcare.
Moral hazard is a concern because it conﬂicts with risk-spreading goals.
Insurance is valuable because it allows people to transfer income from when they
need it less to when they need it more. But this transfer is not perfect because people
may increase their consumption of medical care when it is subsidized. This creates
an inherent second-best problem in designing insurance policies: insurers must trade
off the beneﬁts from spreading more risk against the cost of increased moral hazard
(Cutler and Zeckhauser 2000).
One of the criteria that the literature has proposed for designing public health
insurance programs is to minimize the efﬁciency loss resulting from the introduction
of health insurance (Sloan and Hsieh 2012). The moral hazard problem leads to
welfare loss because the social cost of increased consumption in healthcare exceeds
the corresponding social beneﬁt. The magnitude of welfare loss resulting from
moral hazard depends on the price elasticity of demand for personal healthcare
services. A higher elasticity, which means a higher responsiveness of healthcare
demand to price changes, leads to a larger welfare loss. This suggests that health
services with, respectively, low price elasticities should be given higher priority as
candidates for inclusion in public health programs than health services with higher
price elasticities. For instance, the price elasticity of inpatient care is lower than the
price elasticity of outpatient care (Newhouse 1993). Thus, almost all health
insurance programs provide coverage for hospital care because of its lower price
elasticity. In contrast, some insurance programs may exclude coverage of outpatient
services because the utilization of such services is often more responsive to price
changes (Sloan and Hsieh 2012).
Health insurance programs can also mitigate moral hazard by requiring providers
to follow speciﬁed protocols for care, and by covering only a list of essential
healthcare services. Still another way is to increase cost sharing, that is, the share of
the payment to the provider that the insured consumer bears. While the increase in
cost sharing increases expenditure, it reduces moral hazard. Thus, using tools to
balance moral hazard and risk protection are important for the design of public
health insurance programs.
One advantage of the direct public provision of health insurance, applied
compulsorily to everyone, is that it avoids adverse selection by health insurance
differences. In other words, with many insurance products available, healthy
individuals may tend to buy lower cost policies offering less coverage, such as plans
with higher deductibles, coinsurance, or co-pays, since they do not expect to
become ill. By contrast, persons in poor health may demand more complete
coverage. Under public provision of health insurance everyone is insured under the
same terms, hence adverse selection is not an issue.
In theory, adverse selection can lead to the unraveling of insurance markets
(Rothschild and Stiglitz 1976). Not knowing each insured’s health risk, insurers
frequently do not charge sufﬁciently different premiums to high-risk versus low-risk
individuals. Thus, for any premium that allows the insurer to break even, insurance
is an attractive purchase for the high-risk but not low-risk individuals. As a result,
fewer low-risk persons demand insurance. To break even on the remaining persons
it covers, the insurer must raise premiums. But at higher premiums, some people
who bought insurance before decide against buying insurance. These are the lower
risk subgroup of the higher risk group that purchased insurance. Again, with the
resulting higher risk pool of insureds, the insurer ﬁnds that its premium income is
insufﬁcient. So it raises premiums again, and the healthier persons in this group drop
out of the insurance market. This process of unraveling could continue until only a
very few high-risk individuals remain in the market. All the rest of the population is
rendered worse off because they have lost a mechanism for reducing expenditure
risk at premiums that are appropriate for the health expenditures they are likely to
incur (Sloan and Hsieh 2012).
There are several approaches for dealing with adverse selection. As mentioned
earlier, one way is to eliminate a choice of insurance plan and to provide a single
public health insurance program. However, lack of choice may be welfare reducing
in that less-risk-adverse individuals would purchase less comprehensive policies
than would more-risk-averse individuals if choices were available (McGuire 2012).

8 Conclusions
The last 50 years in LAC have seen improvements in overall levels of health and life
expectancy as well as reductions in infant mortality. Although the region is not
completely free of infectious diseases, it is well advanced in its demographic and
epidemiological transitions, with health problems highly concentrated on NCDs.
This rise of NCDs poses many new challenges for public policy and the effective
delivery of health services.
To address these challenges policymakers must deﬁne a health policy frontier
that identiﬁes primary interventions according to current health priorities. Thus,
taking into account where LAC stands in terms of its demographic and
epidemiological transitions, this paper proposes that the health policy frontier must
include (1) public health policies that reduce the risk factors that cause NCDs by
promoting healthy behavior, and (2) health insurance programs that offer
households effective access to quality healthcare at costs that do not impoverish
contribute to the growing trend of NCDs—such as tobacco use, unhealthy diets, and
physical inactivity—has the potential to reduce at least part of this disease burden
(WHO 2013a). Nevertheless, traditional policy tools that are largely informed by a
rational model of behavior have in many instances fallen short (Luoto and Carman
2014).
Regarding health behavior, there is evidence that people face self-control
problems and knowledge constraints, which may lead them to make suboptimal
decisions. This paper has developed a simple theoretical model that predicts the
impact of those biases on people’s behavior related to food consumption, which
later leads to weight problems and obesity. The comparative static of the model,
which assesses the impact of caloric intake on health, shows that increases in the
gap between best practices and what an individual actually believes lead to an
overconsumption of food. Similarly, reductions in the discount parameter, which
make consumers less forward-looking (i.e., they worry less about their future), lead
to a more present-oriented consumption that is reﬂected in the overconsumption of
food. Thus, the model predicts that a consumer with self-control problems and
knowledge gaps may well spend more than is optimal on food.
This suggests that private decision-making in health can lead to inefﬁcient
outcomes and points to a potential role for cost-effective policies. Looking across
the spectrum of health behaviors, behavioral economics offers insights that seem to
hold promise for cost-effective public interventions. Policies that combine the
provision of information with counseling and with elements of behavioral
economics, such as incentives or commitment mechanisms, appear as a promise
to combat weight problems and obesity. However, the empirical literature suggests
that providing incentives may only be effective in the short term. Therefore, an
avenue for future research is identifying which interventions are the most cost
effective in achieving healthy behaviors in the long term.
In the absence of these cost-effective interventions, policymakers could have to
turn to second-best policies that involve ‘‘sin’’ taxes and subsidies to discourage the
consumption of unhealthy food. Unfortunately, when the population is heterogeneous and a large group makes reliable decisions in their best interest, this type of
intervention would be harmful to them. The overall evidence documents that price
manipulations have the potential to encourage healthier eating, particularly when
those manipulations are large. Nevertheless, improving the understanding of how
changes in prices affect health outcomes and what pricing strategies would be
optimal for addressing excess food consumption and rising rates of obesity is
another research priority.
Apart from prevention, effective approaches to reduce the impact of NCDs
should include broad access to healthcare for people with and at risk of NCDs. The
provision of health insurance plays an important role because it increases health and
ﬁnancial security for many people. Since health insurance in LAC is mostly
provided within the labor market, effective access to healthcare services is restricted
to workers in the formal sector, excluding an informal sector that encompasses
approximately 50 % of the region’s labor force. In this context, we are left with the
for policy interventions proposed in this paper is social health insurance systems
combined with publicly subsidized health insurance programs, as well as taxﬁnanced systems of public health.
It is important to note that a potential unintended consequence of combining
social health insurance with publicly subsidized health insurance programs is the
perverse incentive it may create for formal sector workers to switch to informal
employment. By doing so, workers could avoid having to make mandatory
contributions to the social health insurance system while receiving some free
services under the new program. The model presented in this paper shows that
improvements in the provision of public healthcare will increase the size of the
informal sector and decrease the wages of this sector. However, there is scarce
empirical evidence of the effect of these interventions on workers’ choices of formal
or informal employment in the region. Thus, a suggested area of research is on how
to use robust experimental evidence to establish with conﬁdence the impact of
subsidized health insurance programs on informality and health.
Finally, the introduction of public health insurance programs can lead to
problems of moral hazard, which refers to the effect of insurance on the behavior of
the insured. One of the criteria that the literature has proposed for designing public
health insurance programs is to minimize the efﬁciency loss resulting from the
introduction of health insurance. Policymakers have to balance moral hazard and
risk protection in the design of public health insurance programs.

10 Appendix 2: Health insurance and informality: model structure17
There are three types of economic agents: ﬁrms, workers, and the government;
however, this framework only models the behavior of the ﬁrst two agents.
Firms produce a homogenous good that is traded in a perfectly competitive
market using managerial talent (m) and homogenous units of labor (l). We assume
that the production function is Cobb–Douglas with constant returns to scale, thereby
presenting diminishing returns to labor. There is a continuum of ﬁrms indexed by
their innate managerial talent and distributed with density function g(m) with
support in R?. Each ﬁrm in the economy chooses whether to operate formally or
informally and decides how many units of labor it will hire to produce its output. If a
ﬁrm operates in the formal sector of the economy, its proﬁt function is given by:

17
This appendix is mainly a summary of the model developed by Galiani and Weinschelbaum (2012).
where mb l1Àb is the Cobb–Douglas production function, wf is the prevailing wage
per unit of labor paid to workers in the formal sector (i.e., ﬁrms are wage-takers), t is
the payroll tax levied on ﬁrms, and s is a ﬁxed cost incurred by ﬁrms that operate
formally. If, on the other hand, a ﬁrm operates informally, then its expected proﬁt
function is given by:
Pi ðmÞ ¼ ðmb l1Àb À wi lÞð1 À qÞ;
where wi is the prevalent wage per unit of labor paid to workers in the informal
sector and q is the probability that a ﬁrm is caught operating informally, in which
case it will be closed and will lose its current proﬁts.
Firms choose l to maximize proﬁts. Under the assumptions made, the derived
labor demand for a ﬁrm with managerial talent m is


lf ¼ m

wf ð1 þ tÞ
if it operates formally, and

if it operates informally. Note that both demand functions are linear in managerial
talent. Thus, the size of a ﬁrm (assuming that it does not switch sectors), measured
by l, is linearly increasing in m.
Very small ﬁrms (i.e., those with managerial talent m close to 0) operate informally
because of the ﬁxed cost s that they would have to incur to operate formally. As in
Rauch (1991), there is size dualism: small ﬁrms operate informally while large ﬁrms
operate formally. When there are ﬁrms operating formally and the proﬁt functions
satisfy the following condition, there is a unique cutoff point in ﬁrm size:

where the ﬁrst term represents the demand for informal labor and the second the
demand for formal labor.
Workers are endowed with l units of homogenous labor. There is a continuum
of workers indexed by their endowment of labor and distributed with density
function h(l) with support in R?. Thus, wages are set for units of substitutable labor. Each worker has to choose whether to sell his/her labor to a ﬁrm that operates
formally or to a ﬁrm that operates informally. Workers cannot split their units of
labor between different ﬁrms. In the ﬁrst case, the worker receives wf per unit of
labor plus mandated social beneﬁts. In the second case, the worker receives only
wi per unit of labor and we assume the worker receives healthcare only in public
hospitals ðPH).
The utility of a worker who chooses to work in the formal sector is:
Uf ðwf l; HIÞ ¼ wf l þ HI À c;
where HI are the nonpecuniary beneﬁts that, for simplicity sake, we equate with a
government-provided health insurance package that we assume covers all members
of the worker’s family.18,19
Workers also incur a ﬁxed cost c for working in the formal sector. This
includes not only the direct costs (De Soto 1989) but also, and perhaps more
importantly, indirect costs such as unemployment insurance and other subsidies,
such as cash transfers, that a worker would have to disregard when he or she
accepts a formal job.
When an informal ﬁrm is detected, its workers do not receive their payment. The
expected utility of a worker who chooses to work in the informal sector is:
Ui ðwi l; PHÞ ¼ wi lð1 À qÞ þ PH;
where PH represents the health services that informal workers received in the public
health sector.
When there are workers in both the formal and the informal sector and the utility
functions satisfy the following condition, then there is a unique cutoff point that
determines that workers with low levels of human capital will be in the informal
sector and those with high levels of human capital will be employed in the formal
sector:

18
Although for the sake of simplicity we equate mandated social beneﬁts with a health insurance
package that provides better health coverage than public hospitals, there are other mandated beneﬁts
associated with formal jobs that affect workers’ payoffs similarly. Examples are pensions and family
allowances.
19
There is a large literature in the United States that shows that health insurance is an important
determinant of job mobility (Gruber and Madrian 2004). Madrian (1994), for example, estimates that

Abstract The health landscape in Latin America and the Caribbean is changing
quickly. The region is undergoing a demographic and epidemiological transition in
which health problems are highly concentrated on noncommunicable diseases
(NCDs). In light of this, the region faces two main challenges: (1) develop costeffective policies to prevent NCD risk factors, and (2) increase access to quality
healthcare in a scenario in which a large share of the labor force is employed in the
informal sector. This paper describes both alternative interventions to expand health
insurance coverage and their trade-off with labor informality and moral hazard
problems. The paper also focuses on obesity as a case example of an NCD, and
emphasizes how lack of knowledge along with self-control problems would lead
people to make suboptimal decisions related to food consumption, which may later
manifest in obesity problems.

The developing world, and in particular Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC),
has experienced both a secular decline in mortality and signiﬁcant improvements in
the health of its population over the last 200 years. As we start the twenty-ﬁrst
century, a key observation is that the pattern and nature of mortality and morbidity
has changed over recent decades and continues changing today. Health systems in
developing countries are facing major challenges mainly because of growing
epidemiological diversity as a consequence of economic development, technological change in medicine, and population aging.
Although LAC is not completely free of infectious diseases, is well advanced in
its demographic and epidemiological transitions, with health problems highly
concentrated on noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). People in the region are
equally likely to die prematurely from just one NCD than from all communicable
diseases combined. Half of years of life lost in the region, as well as the leading
causes of mortality and morbidity, are attributable to NCDs (Anderson et al. 2009).
Furthermore, there is little doubt that the levels of NCDs will substantially increase
in the near future. It is predicted that by 2020, NCDs will cause seven of every ten
deaths in developing countries (Boutayeb 2006). Two of the factors believed to be
central drivers of this trend are aging populations and the stark and simultaneous
increase in rates of obesity worldwide (WHO 2013a).
Noncommunicable diseases, which are characterized by shared risk factors,
multi-morbidity, and chronicity, pose several challenges for the organization of
healthcare. To address these challenges, policymakers must deﬁne a health policy
frontier that identiﬁes the primary interventions according to current health
priorities. Taking into account where LAC stands in term of both its demographic
and epidemiological transition, the health policy frontier in the region must include
(1) public health policies that reduce the risk factors that cause NCDs by promoting
healthy behavior; and (2) health insurance programs that offer households access to
quality healthcare at costs that do not impoverish them.
Regarding the ﬁrst priority of the health policy frontier, interventions that create
conducive environments for making healthy choices available are essential to
motivate people to adopt and sustain healthy behaviors. Although it is known that
eliminating preventable risk factors may reduce the burden of NCDs, it is not known
what the best way is to achieve this goal. Most public policies designed to address
NCDs use a rational economic model of behavior that assumes people make choices
that reﬂect their preferences subject to their available resources (time, information,
and prices of goods and labor). However, the consensus on the success of traditional
efforts to encourage health promotion is that they have been at best modestly
effective (Luoto and Carman 2014).
People could deviate from a rational model of behavior, for example, there is
evidence that present bias (i.e., a higher discount rate between the present and the
immediate future than between two future time periods) plays an important role in
health behavior (Kremer and Glennerster 2012). People also face knowledge
the available knowledge rationally. For instance, they may choose poor diets simply
because they do not know which diets are healthy.
This paper explores these issues by developing a simple theoretical model of
household decision-making to assess how lack of knowledge along with self-control
issues affect people’s behavior related to food consumption, which later leads to
weight problems and obesity. The focus is on obesity because it is the second
highest behavioral risk factor affecting mortality (Flegal et al. 2005; Willett et al.
2005) and is now one of the major causes of rising healthcare costs (Finkelstein
et al. 2003). In addition, there has been a remarkable upsurge in the number of
people considered overweight or obese in all demographic and age groups in LAC.
Compared with other regions, weight problems and obesity are particularly
prevalent in LAC, with rates that range from 30 to 50 % (York et al. 2004).
The model presented in this paper predicts that when individuals have either selfcontrol problems or knowledge constraints, they make decisions that lead them to
behave in a way that is not in their own best interest or that are unwise even
according to their own preferences. People with self-control problems impose
negative externalities on their future. Those within-person externalities have been
called ‘‘internalities’’ (Whitman 2006). The harm resulting from an internality might
be avoided in more than one way. Unfortunately, the private market only
imperfectly provides such self-control mechanisms (Gruber 2002). It is very
difﬁcult to truly commit oneself to not overeat or to maintain an exercise routine, for
example. This suggests a potential role for cost-effective policies. However, these
policies should not prevent people from behaving in their own best interests. Ideally,
these policies should create beneﬁts for those who do not make reliable decisions in
their best interest while be harmless to those that make reliable decisions.
Robust evidence on policy interventions that address these biases among
overweight and obese people is rather limited, and its results are mixed at best.
Looking across the spectrum of health behaviors, it can be seen that behavioral
economics offers insights that seem to hold promise for cost-effective public
interventions. Speciﬁcally, most cost-effective policies to combat weight problems
and obesity, at least in the short and medium term, seem to be those that combine
the provision of information with counseling and with elements of behavioral
economics such as incentives or commitment mechanisms. In view of that,
identifying which interventions are the most cost effective in achieving healthy
behaviors in the long term is a priority of research.
In the absence of these cost-effective interventions, policymakers must turn to
second-best policies that could involve ‘‘sin’’ taxes and subsidies to discourage the
consumption of unhealthy food. The overall empirical evidence documents that
price manipulations have the potential to encourage healthier eating, particularly
when those manipulations are large. Nevertheless, an important topic for future
work is investigating how changes in prices affect health outcomes and what pricing
strategies would be optimal for addressing excess food consumption and rising rates
of obesity.
Regarding the second priority of the health policy frontier, the provision of health
healthcare services is restricted to workers in the formal sector, excluding those in
the informal sector who encompass approximately 50 percent of the region’s labor
force. Thus, LAC countries face the challenge of expanding health insurance
coverage in a scenario in which a large share of the labor force is employed in the
informal sector. There is little agreement among countries as to how best to achieve
broader coverage. Policy interventions proposed here include social health
insurance systems combined with publicly subsidized health insurance programs,
as well as tax-ﬁnanced systems of public health.
A potential unintended consequence of combining social health insurance with
publicly subsidized health insurance programs is the incentive it may create for
formal sector workers to switch to informal employment. By doing so, workers
could avoid having to make otherwise mandatory contributions to the social health
insurance system while receiving some free services under the new program. This
paper presents a theoretical model that shows that employment-based health
insurance schemes interfere with the functioning of the labor market. Speciﬁcally,
the model predicts that improvements in the provision of public healthcare (e.g.,
public hospitals) increase the size of the informal sector and decrease the wages of
this sector, while increasing the wages of the formal sector.
There is scarce rigorous empirical evidence of the effect of publicly subsidized
health insurance programs on workers’ choices of formal or informal employment
in the region. Thus, a better understanding of the distortions generated by public
health insurance programs and the magnitude of their effects on both health status
and informality is central to inform policy decisions.
Finally, the introduction of public health insurance programs may also lead to
problems of moral hazard, which refers to the effect of insurance on the behavior of
the insured. One of the criteria that the literature has proposed for designing public
health insurance programs is to minimize the efﬁciency loss resulting from the
introduction of such insurance (Sloan and Hsieh 2012). Policymakers have to
balance moral hazard and risk protection in the design of public health insurance
programs.
The next section of this paper explores the evolution of LAC in terms of its
demographic and epidemiological transitions. Section 3 develops a simple theoretical model of health, self-control, and knowledge in the context NCDs and discusses
cost-effective interventions to address these problems. Section 4 presents the
rationales for creating health insurance programs and describes components of their
design. Section 5 summarizes the main features of the healthcare systems in the
region, and Sect. 6 presents a conceptual framework that assesses the relationship
between health insurance and the labor market. Section 7 examines alternative
policies to expand health insurance coverage for poor and unskilled workers in the
informal sector and brieﬂy describes the potential problems this might create in
terms of incentivizing informality and moral hazard. Finally, Sect. 8 presents
This section aims to determine the current stage of LAC’s demographic and
epidemiological transition. The implication for policymakers is straightforward:
identifying where the region is in terms of these transitions is critical to establish a
health policy frontier. The section ﬁrst examines the long-term trends of health
worldwide and then develops a conceptual framework to approach the epidemiological and demographic transition of the region. Second, the section describes the
pattern of change in mortality and morbidity from communicable to NCDs to
determine the priorities for health policies.
2.1 Health in the long term
Throughout the twentieth century, growth in real income in developed countries was
accompanied by a historically unprecedented reduction in mortality rates that caused
life expectancy at birth to grow by nearly 30 years. These improvements were
matched by similar advancements in poor and middle-income countries. In the years
just after World War II, life expectancy gaps between rich and poor countries started to
contract across the world. Poor and middle-income countries enjoyed rapid growth in
life expectancy in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s. For example, while the increase in
longevity between 1960 and 2005 in the USA was 7.9 years, in the same period the
increase in longevity in China was 35.5 years (Sloan and Hsieh 2012).
Looking at the evidence as a whole, it is possible to see the history of reduced
mortality and increases in life expectancy as encompassing three phases (Cutler
et al. 2006; Deaton 2005). During the ﬁrst phase from the middle of the eighteenth
century to the middle of the nineteenth century, improved nutrition and economic
growth played a large role in health. During this phase, infectious disease mortality
declined by 95 %. Fogel (1994, 1997, 2004) assigned nutritional improvements the
primary role in this reduction in mortality. He argued that agricultural yields
increased signiﬁcantly during the eighteenth century, and as a result, people were
better fed and thus could better resist most bacterial (although not viral) disease, and
could recover more rapidly and more often. Neither personal healthcare nor public
health appeared to have had much impact prior to the 1900s, when most of the
mortality decline had already occurred in rich countries (McKeown 1976).
The second phase occurred in the closing decades of the nineteenth century and into
the twentieth century. In this phase, the primary factors that contributed to the secular
reduction in mortality were revolutionary improvements in sanitation and developments in public health policy (e.g., ﬁltering and chlorinating water supplies, building
sanitation systems, draining swamps, and pasteurizing milk). Public health did not
fully come into its own until the acceptance of the germ theory of disease in the 1880s
and 1890s, which led to a wave of new public health initiatives and the conveyance of
safe health practices such as boiling bottles of milk, protecting food from insects,
washing hands, and ventilating rooms, among others. The dramatic subsequent
reduction in water- and food-borne diseases (typhoid, cholera, dysentery, and
infectious disease. Over the course of the twentieth century, the role of medical
advances increased in importance and gave place to the third phase in mortality
reduction, which dates from the 1930s to the present. This phase has been the era of
big medicine, starting with vaccinations and antibiotics, and moving on to the
expensive and intensive personal interventions that characterize the medical system
today. The ﬁrst important medical interventions were vaccinations. However,
quantitatively more important for mortality was the development of new therapeutics, such as antibiotics. By 1960, mortality from infectious diseases had declined to
its current level.
This ‘‘mortality revolution’’ spread throughout the world much more rapidly than
did modern economic growth, leading to enormous improvements in low- and
middle-income countries in life expectancy and mortality rates, especially among
children. In these countries, the reduction in mortality began in the early twentieth
century and then accelerated dramatically after World War II (Lee 2003). This
mainly happened because 200 years’ worth of progress against mortality in rich
countries was rapidly brought to bear on mortality in poor and middle-income
countries. Measures primary related to disease control—such as improvements in
the water supply, cleansing the environment of disease vectors, the use of
antibiotics, and widespread immunization of children—were introduced to the rest
of the world over a relatively very short span of time (Cutler et al. 2006). LAC in
particular has shown a great propensity to catch up to developed countries over the
last half century, particularly since 1970 (Jack 1999).
2.2 Demographic and epidemiological transitions
The pattern and nature of mortality and morbidity has changed over the past 100 years
and continues to change in developing countries today. This so-called epidemiological
transition is linked with the current demographic transition, wherein population age
structures also undergo signiﬁcant changes as societies develop.
The classic demographic transition starts with mortality reduction, followed after
a time by reduced fertility. According to economic theories of fertility, couples wish
to have a certain number of surviving children, rather than births per se, hence, if
this assumption holds, once potential parents recognize an exogenous increase in
child survival, fertility should decline. This causes population growth rates ﬁrst to
accelerate and then to slow again, moving toward low fertility, long life, and an old
population.
Although important differences remain, there has been a rapid global convergence in fertility and mortality among nations. The demographic transition has
spread to all parts of the world, and is projected to be completed by 2100, when the
global population will have risen by a factor of 10 compared with that in 1800, the
length of life will have tripled from 27 years in 1800 to 81 at 2100, and births per
woman will have dropped from six to two (Lee 2003).
The epidemiological transition has paralleled the demographic transition in
developed countries and is still under way in less-developed societies. During the
1971).
With health and social conditions improving, people survive through their early
years into middle and older ages where they face the elevated risk of dying from
chronic diseases. The most favorable effects on survival are concentrated among
infants, children, and women of childbearing age (Olshansky and Ault 1986). Thus,
the reduction in mortality that comes with the epidemiological transition widens the
‘‘demographic gap’’ between birth rates and death rates, and hence affects the
demographic change by bolstering population growth. In a more subtle manner, the
mortality transition affects demographic movements indirectly through its impact on
fertility and the composition of the population.
Rich countries have completed the shift from an epidemiological era characterized by the preponderance of communicable diseases to one characterized by NCDs
(Frenk et al. 1994). Developing countries have also been following this path: during
at least the past half century, their epidemiological proﬁle has been characterized by
both a sharp reduction in mortality rates and a differentiation of the causes of deaths.
Emerging NCDs have been increasing over the past two decades (Yach et al. 2004),
and are predicted to continue to rise.
The goal of trying to describe and disentangle the determinants of changing
disease patterns is to elucidate some of the fundamental issues confronting
policymakers. Health policymakers should undertake an epidemiological analysis of
major diseases and health problems to deﬁne the relevant health policy frontier. This
implies focusing on policies and targeting resources according to current health
priorities without neglecting those health areas where intervention has been
successful.
In other words, if a country is in the early stage of the epidemiological transition
during which major health problems are concentrated on communicable diseases,
health policy should be centered on providing curative services—such as routine
healthcare, vaccinations, and rehydration therapy—as well as on designing
programs to improve sanitation.
On the other side, if a country is in a more advanced stage of its epidemiological
transition during which health problems are concentrated on NCDs and chronic
diseases in adults and the elderly, the health policy frontier should be centered on
preventive health services and health promotion. In this case, health promotion
strategies should focus on behavioral changes related to smoking, alcohol, diet, and
exercise to prevent deaths due to obesity, hypertension, atherosclerosis, and
diabetes. This will require government interventions not only in education but also
through regulation and taxation (Jamison and Mosley 1991; Yach et al. 2004).
Policies to extend health insurance coverage are also essential considering that
NCDs require long-term treatment.
2.3 Health conditions in Latin America and the Caribbean: an overview
In LAC the past 50 years have been positive in terms of overall levels of health, life
epidemiological transitions, with health problems highly concentrated on NCDs
(Frenk et al. 1989).
Since 1970, death from infections has been declining while death from NCDs has
been increasing. There was a signiﬁcant change in the causes of death over a
relatively short period of time. This suggests that the epidemiological transition has
accelerated in the last 40 years. At present, 14.2 % of total deaths are due to
communicable diseases, while NCDs and injures are responsible for 73.4 and
12.4 % of total deaths, respectively. Furthermore, an increase in NCDs is expected
over the coming decades in LAC.
2.3.1 Demographic transition
LAC countries have undergone profound demographic changes that are reﬂected in
the reduction in population growth (by 1.3 % from 2005 to 2010) and in the aging of
the population. This change results from a rapid fall in fertility, which has reached a
rate of decline never seen before in the region (Frenk et al. 1994)—fertility fell to
2.3 children per women in the region according to UNDESA (2013)—preceded by a
sustained reduction in mortality (Fig. 1; Table 1). The reduction in mortality, which
began toward the end of the ﬁrst half of the twentieth century, has now resulted in a
life expectancy at birth of 73.4 years (Table 2).
Child mortality is a key indicator not only of child health and nutrition but also of
the implementation of child survival interventions and, more broadly, of social and
economic development. Table 1 shows that since 1970, LAC has reduced its under5 mortality rate by more than 70 % and is among the developing regions with the

taken place rapidly. Although there is still some variation between and within
countries, at the regional level two major changes have taken place: a reduction in
demographic dependency (ratio of people younger than 14 or older than 65 to the
working-age population) and population aging (ECLAC 2007). Slowly but surely,
population is getting older: the proportion and the absolute number of persons aged
65 and over will rise steadily in the coming decades (Table 3). As a result, it is
projected that the number of persons aged 65 or over will be almost ﬁve times
higher in 2050 than in 2000.
Demographic aging poses signiﬁcant challenges for governments. First, there is
consensus that it is essential to increase social security coverage of the current work
force and to expand coverage of the elderly, including the option of noncontributory
or welfare pensions. Second, there is a need to shift the focus of care to preventive
care and health promotion, not only in old age, but also at all other stages of the life
cycle (ECLAC 2007).
2.3.2 Epidemiological transition: communicable and noncommunicable diseases
This subsection attempts to describe the leading causes of death from a regional
perspective to characterize the epidemiological proﬁle in LAC.
2.3.2.1 Communicable diseases In the last three decades of the twentieth century
and in the early twenty-ﬁrst century, the most important public health achievements in
LAC have been in communicable disease control and basic sanitation (Echeverri et al.
2008). The displacement of communicable diseases by NCDs as the leading cause of
death provides evidence of the region’s epidemiological transition (Frenk et al. 1994).
Among communicable diseases in LAC, infectious and parasitic diseases and
respiratory infections constitute the leading cause of death. Tuberculosis, HIV/
AIDS, diarrheal diseases, and vector-borne diseases are the most prevalent.
Evidence shows that the region has succeeded in decreasing premature death and
disability from most communicable, newborn, nutritional, and maternal causes.

between 1998 and 2008.1 The region has made signiﬁcant progress in controlling
tuberculosis and vector-borne diseases, but HIV/AID remains a major challenge
(Table 4). Diarrheal disease was the number one disease burden in LAC in 1990,
but dropped to the 20th leading cause in 2010 (World Bank and Institute for Health
Metrics and Evaluations 2010). Among the principal bacterial agents of diarrheal
diseases is Vibrio cholerae (cholera). However, the prevalence of this disease
region-wide has declined. The number of cholera cases reported to the World Health
Organization, as well as the number of countries that reported cholera cases in the
region, decreased in 2012 (WHO 2013b).
The most sustainable investment to protect populations from cholera and other
diarrheal diseases continues to be improvements in water supply and sanitation. The
region has increased coverage of safe water (access to safe water increased from
82 % of the population in 1990 to 89 % in 2002) and extended sanitation coverage,
although some countries in LAC still have a long way to go (Fay and Morrison
2007).
Thus, communicable diseases have become less preponderant over time and no
longer pose the greatest current threat to public health. However, it is important to
recognize that they still maintain a position in the epidemiological proﬁle.
2.3.2.2 Noncommunicable diseases According to epidemiological research,
chronic NCDs are the biggest threat to the health of the world population.
Figures for 2011 indicate that almost 36 million people died from NCDs around the
world that year, and it is projected that by 2030 the leading causes of death will be
ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease (COPD; De Maio 2011).
Murray and Lopez (1997) argue that the ratio of NCDs to communicable diseases
is a crude but useful indicator of the epidemiological transition. This ratio ranges
from more than 13 in established market economies to 0.4 in sub-Saharan Africa.
According to this criterion, China, followed distantly by LAC and other Asia
islands, are all further along the path of the combined demographic and
epidemiological transitions, which surely will affect potential demand for health
services in these countries.
LAC has the third highest level of deaths due to NCDs and trails closely behind
the group of high-income countries (Table 5). Cardiovascular diseases and
malignant neoplasms, followed by diabetes and chronic respiratory diseases are
the leading causes of deaths from NCDs in LAC.
From the point of view of the demographic transition, the major effect of reduced
fertility is the resulting change in age structure, as mentioned earlier. Furthermore,
the growing proportion of adults and the elderly increases the relative importance of
NCDs. Moreover, certain NCDs are starting to attack demographics previously
unaffected. For instance, type two diabetes, generally known as adult onset diabetes,
is increasingly common among young populations.

Cardiovascular diseases

Of total deaths caused by cardiovascular diseases in LAC, 85 % were due to four
causes: ischemic heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, heart failure, and hypertensive diseases. Among these, ischemic heart disease is the leading cause of death
in the region, with rates markedly higher among males than females.
The major established risk factors of cardiovascular diseases are hypertension,
diabetes mellitus, high cholesterol, obesity, and smoking. These factors, which
mainly depend on behavior, are highly prevalent in the region, with the most
signiﬁcant being unhealthy diets, physical inactivity, and smoking. Behavioral risk
factors are responsible for about 80 % of coronary heart disease and cerebrovascular
disease.
Being overweight or obese are major risk factors for a number of chronic diseases
apart from cardiovascular diseases, including diabetes and cancer. Worldwide
obesity has nearly doubled since 1980. In 2008, more than 1.4 billon adults were
overweight (deﬁned as a body mass index, or BMI, of 25 or above). Of these, over
200 million men and women were obese (deﬁned as a BMI of 30 or above).
Compared with other regions, obesity is highly prevalent in LAC: the rate for
obesity and being overweight ranges from 30 to 50 % (York et al. 2004).
Furthermore, a recent WHO/PAHO survey revealed an increasing trend in obesity in
the region, and Finucane et al. (2011) estimate that between 1980 and 2008 the
average BMI for women in Central America and South America increased by 1.3
and 1.4 U per decade, respectively.
This pattern is also seen in the prevalence of smoking, which is increasing in
many low- and middle-income countries. Surveys in 14 Latin America countries
reported that the prevalence of this behavioral risk varied from 24.1 to 66.3 %
among men, and from 5.5 to 26.6 % among women (Lanas et al. 2007). WHO
projections suggest that by 2020 tobacco will become the largest single cause of

Malignant neoplasms and chronic respiratory diseases

The second leading cause of death from NCDs in LAC is cancer. WHO estimates
that the percentage increase in cancer incidence by 2030, compared with 2008, will
be greater in low-income and lower middle-income countries (82 and 70 %,
respectively) than in upper middle-income and high-income countries (58 and 40 %,
respectively). The most important cancers in terms of frequency, absolute number of
deaths, and mortality are lung, liver, and stomach cancer.
Chronic respiratory diseases (asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
(COPD), emphysema, and chronic bronchitis) represent a challenge to public health
in the region because of their frequency, severity, and economic impact. In 2011,
these diseases caused 5.3 % of all deaths. Among these diseases, COPD and asthma
are the most important, and in middle-income countries they are emerging as serious
public health problems. Furthermore, WHO has predicted a rise in mortality from
COPD from the fourth leading cause of death in 2004 to the third in 2030, largely
attributable to rising tobacco consumption and biomass fuel exposure, both major
risk factors for COPD and overwhelmingly prevalent in developing countries.
•

Diabetes

Diabetes is responsible for 6.4 % of all deaths in LAC but it is expected to more
than double between 2000 and 2030, affecting an estimated 32.9 million people in
the region (Wild et al. 2004). The number of people with diabetes is increasing due
to population growth, aging, and the higher prevalence of obesity. Poorly controlled
diabetes increases the risk of cardiovascular diseases, neuropathy, amputation, and
blindness.
Diabetes continues to be one of the greatest threats to health in the twenty-ﬁrst
century, and the number of cases will continues to rise unless prevention improves,

Neurological conditions

Globally, an estimated 1.5 million people died from neurological conditions in
2011. Among them, Alzheimer’s disease (and other forms of dementia), epilepsy,
and Parkinson’s disease are the leading causes of death. Population aging is
having a profound impact on the emergence of the dementia epidemic, with
Alzheimer’s disease and vascular dementia the most common underlying
pathologies. Age-standardized prevalence for people older than 60 years varies
in a narrow band of 5–7 % in most world regions, with a higher prevalence in
LAC (8.5 %). It is expected that the number of persons living with dementia will
double every 20 years to 65.7 million by 2030 and 115.4 million by 2050 (Prince
et al. 2013).
Around ﬁve million people in LAC suffer from epilepsy. Different studies show
that the median prevalence of lifetime epilepsy and active epilepsy in this region is
15.8 per 1000 inhabitants and 10.7 per 1000 inhabitants per year, respectively, and
that the median incidence is 132.2 per 100,000 inhabitants per year (Bruno et al.
2013). These rates are relatively high compared to other regions, such as the
northern hemisphere countries.
To summarize, taking into account where LAC stands in terms of its
epidemiological and demographic transitions, it is crucial to establish a health
policy frontier that meets the new patterns of health of the population, which are
characterized by a high prevalence of NCDs that share risk factors and are chronic.
In this context, the health policy frontier in the region must include (1) public health
policies to reduce the risk factors that cause NCDs by promoting healthy behavior;
and (2) health insurance programs that offer households access to quality healthcare
at costs that do not impoverish them.
Consequently, policies that create environments conducive to making healthy
choices affordable are essential to motivate people to adopt and sustain healthy
behavior. In addition, it is fundamental to have policies that support the design of a
health insurance system that provides healthcare coverage for long-term treatment.
A comprehensive analysis of policies in these two areas is beyond the scope of this
paper. However, the sections that follow focus on two important areas of the health
policy discussion where the tools of economic analysis are particularly useful:
public health efforts to encourage changes toward healthier behaviors, and the
structure of health insurance programs in the region.

3 Noncommunicable diseases: obesity
This section starts with a brief introduction to the causes of obesity, then develops a
simple model of health to assess how knowledge and self-control problems affect
people’s behavior related to food consumption. Finally, the section explores the
Humanity is changing in both size and shape. As mentioned before, there has been a
remarkable upsurge in the number of people considered overweight or obese. The
rapidity with which the incidence of obesity has increased suggests that genetic
change on a population level is an unlikely cause although there must be biological
factors involved with the obesity epidemic.2 Furthermore, not all people are
becoming fat. Thus, how can we explain both the sudden change in human mean
weight and the variability among people in essentially the same environments?
Power and Schulkin (2009) suggest that much of the increase in obesity is due to a
mismatch between adaptive biological characteristics of our species and the modern
environment, which has changed dramatically from the one under which we
evolved. According to these authors, human obesity is an inappropriate response to
modern living conditions.
Human obesity is an example of an adaptive biological system that is storing fat
in the body. Most fat is stored in adipose tissue, and fat is an efﬁcient way to store
energy. Excess energy, consumed at one time, is stored as fat in adipose tissue to be
mobilized and used at a later time when food supply is inadequate. In the past, the
ability to store an increased amount of adipose tissue was largely constrained by the
external environment. Life was hard and food was often scarce; hence, humans
evolved to respond and adapt to those conditions (Neel 1962). However, the modern
environment has relaxed many of those constraints—to some extent, food is
plentiful, and obtaining it does not require extreme or prolonged exertion. This
development, in addition to technological, economic, and cultural factors, has
created the circumstances that allow for the increased numbers of overweight and
obese people in the world. Thus, the current epidemic of obesity results from the
interaction of our environment with past behaviors that are inappropriate in the
modern world (Power and Schulkin 2009). Understanding why these factors lead to
obesity requires analyzing the underlying biology.
According to Power and Schulkin (2009) there are three key aspects of human
biology that represent adaptive evolutionary changes in our physiology and
metabolism that increase the susceptibility to obesity under modern conditions:
our large (and metabolically expensive) brains; an increase in neonatal fatness;
and an increase in maternal fatness. Our larger brain provides us with greatly
enhanced cognitive abilities, but it also comes with substantial metabolic and
nutrient costs. In the past, external constraints limited our ability to consume fat
and to metabolically produce fat from excess energy intake. These circumstances
led to our ancestors’ enhanced ability to store fat, at least in females, and as
fetuses and infants.
The biology of building and maintaining our brains may explain many of the
preferences that put us at risk of obesity now that we have used technology and
culturally transmitted knowledge to increase access to food and decrease the
exertion required to survive. In other words, our large brains have allowed us to
2

Less than 5 % of obese people have been shown to have identiﬁable hormonal, physiological, or
appears to have been accompanied by the selection of physiology and behavior that
make many people susceptible to obesity (Power and Schulkin 2009, 322).
The factors that affect our diet, activity, and eventually our motivation to
behave in ways that make us vulnerable to gaining excess fat cannot all be
explained by biology. Cutler et al. (2003) suggest that the division of labor in food
preparation may explain the increase in calories consumed during the past
50 years. They argue that since the 1960s there has been a revolution in the mass
preparation of food, roughly comparable to the mass production revolution in
manufactured goods that happened a century ago. Technological innovations have
enabled food manufacturers to cook food centrally and ship it to consumers for
rapid consumption. The switch from individual to mass preparation lowered the
time price of food consumption and the ﬁxed costs of food preparation. They
argue that the lower time costs have led to increased food consumption, and
ultimately increased weights.
The standard economic view argues that lower prices for any good increase the
budget set and make people better off. However, if there are market failures, such as
asymmetric information, this result might not be true. In the case of obesity, there is
evidence of information failure, particularly under-provision of information or lack
of knowledge. Beyond this market failure, there is also evidence that individuals
prioritize immediate gratiﬁcation over potential long-term negative results (Swinburn et al. 2011; Kremer and Glennester 2012). Self-control problems and lack of
knowledge can lead individuals to suboptimal investment in preventive health
behavior; in this context, lowering the time costs of food consumption may
exacerbate this problem.
3.2 A simple model of health, self-control and household knowledge
A combination of imperfect information about the beneﬁts of certain behaviors and
the emphasis people put on immediate gratiﬁcation may lead individuals to take
decisions that do not improve their quality of life (Banerjee and Duﬂo 2011).
Households select recipes based on certain prior beliefs about the effects and side
effects of different alternatives. They are neither perfectly informed nor totally
ignorant of the implications of their choices, although in making those choices they
try to process the available knowledge rationally. Yet, in so doing, they are limited
because the perceptions of the actual relationship between their actions and their
health may differ for two reasons. First, the best knowledge available may not be
entirely correct or may even be false. Second, there may be a gap between the state
of the art and the knowledge actually used by households, either because household
members do not know the best practices or because despite having access to those
practices they refuse to follow the recommendations, not having been convinced
that the health advantages of a particular good are worth the cost or effort.
Consequently, households not only face a budget constraint but also a knowledge
constraint (Mokyr 2002).
Self-control issues are likely to be important as well. For example, people
(Cutler et al. 2003). A similar pattern can be observed in tobacco and alcohol use,
where individuals have time-inconsistent preferences even though they recognize
the long-run trade-offs between current and future health. Several studies suggest
that present bias leads consumers to underinvest in preventive behavior (Kremer and
Glennerster 2012).
For the sake of simplicity, we adapt the framework proposed by Cutler et al.
(2003) and Mokyr (2002) to a discrete time model with three periods (youth,
adulthood, and old age) during which a representative consumer discounts all time
in the future at a higher discount rate, but trades off consumption in the future at the
time discount rate. Such an individual will always want to begin a diet or an
exercise routine tomorrow, or to reduce consumption of tobacco later (because the
long-term beneﬁts justify the lost utility tomorrow) but not today (because of the
immediate gratiﬁcation from food, tobacco, or leisure).
For this model we formally use the hyperbolic discounting framework. Following
Cutler et al. (2003), we assume that people discount the future in two ways. The ﬁrst
is standard exponential utility: for a period of time t in the future, people get qt units
of utility, where 0 q 1: In addition, people also make a distinction between the
‘‘current self’’ and the ‘‘future self.’’ This distinction is the essence of the hyperbolic
model, which captures the property that discount rates decline (weakly) with
horizon length; therefore, events in the near future are discounted at a higher
implicit discount rate than events in a distant future. People discount the future
self’s utility with the parameter 0 c 1. If c ¼ 1, the future is considered the same
as today; if c ¼ 0, the future is ignored. With probability p, people switch from
being current selves to being future selves. Thus, the value of future consumption is
probabilistic; with probability p the future utility remains connected to the current
self, and with probability ð1 À pÞ the future utility is associated with the future self
and is worth only c because the individual is myopic.
At each point in time, people receive utility from consumption of both a durable
composite commodity (C) and food, represented by caloric intake (X). Individuals
also receive utility from a composite variable of life expectancy and health (H). To
eliminate income effects, we assume utility is linear in the composite commodity
and that income (Y) is high enough:
Ut ¼ Ct þ vðXt Þ þ Ht
The cost of food in period t is Pt, including both time and ﬁnancial costs. Individuals
are assumed to face no credit constraints, so they can lend or borrow at rate i. The
special characteristic of this setup is that H is determined by the household production function:
Ht ¼ lHtÀ1 þ E þ ðA À eÞFðXtÀ1 Þ;
where E is a common factor independent of the consumption basket and can be
interpreted as the environment over which the consumer has no control, and F
represents how goods consumed and time spent producing them are transformed
(i.e., caloric intake) can be harmful to health if it exceeds a certain threshold.
It is important to realize that the best practice knowledge could still be far from
the accurate truth. The parameter A is a shift factor that measures the degree to
which the best practice grasps the true effects of caloric intake on health. A ranges
from one to zero; A ¼ 1 means that the best practice fully captures the impact of
food consumption on health, while at the other extreme, A ¼ 0 means that the best
practice is uninformative about the consequences and no one knows that food
consumption has any effect on health at all (and thus the only reason why food is
consumed is because it conveys direct utility). Moreover, individuals lag in their
knowledge behind best practice techniques. Therefore, e is an individual-speciﬁc
measure of the difference between an individual’s technology and the best practice
regarding good X. It may be best viewed as a gap between the best technique in
society and what an individual actually believes. Consequently, the term ðA À eÞ
measures the degree to which the consumer is aware of and believes the mapping of
food consumption on health, and it is deﬁned here for simplicity as a multiplicative
deviation from ideal priors. We expect this term to be somewhere between 0 and 1.
An increase in ðA À eÞ within that interval means that a consumer can do better in
terms of overall utility simply by redeploying the available resources. If
ðA À eÞ ¼ 1, the consumer follows the best practice by some kind of ideal standard.
If e ¼ 0 but A\1, the consumer follows the best practice by the imperfect standards
of the time. The possibility that ðA À eÞ [ 1 is especially interesting. This means
that the consumer is exaggerating the perceived effect of the good on his or her
health and thus underconsuming it to the point where its quantity is suboptimal.
Assuming that vðXt Þ ¼ lnðXt Þ, the individual maximizes the following intertemporal utility function:

This functional form works perfectly for food because at low levels of consumption, health improves as
a result of food, but it worsens when the level of consumption is high. Similar results could be obtained
for a functional form that is decreasing on the whole range, which describes the case of alcohol and

Since consumers have to spend their income, they will pick a certain combination of

To analyze how self-control issues and household knowledge affect the behavior
of consumers, we study the comparative statics of the model. The results obtained,
which are described below, are proven in Appendix 1.
Result 1 When there is a larger gap between an individual’s knowledge and the
best practice technique, which assess the impact of caloric intake on health, the
consumption of food is higher in both the ﬁrst and second period (i.e.,
dX0
dX1
de [ 0; de [ 0).
Result 2 When individuals care more about the future, their caloric intake is
lower in both the ﬁrst and second period (i.e., dX0 \0; dX1 \0).
dc
dc
Thus, increases in the gap (represented by e) between the best practice technique
and what an individual actually believes will produce overconsumption of caloric
intake in the ﬁrst and second period (X0 and X1 ), regardless of the value of the
discount parameter (c). Therefore, a person’s level of health will be lower.
Similarly, reductions in the discount parameter (c) make consumers less forwardlooking (they worry less about their future) and lead to more immediate
consumption that is reﬂected in the overconsumption of caloric intake in the ﬁrst
and second periods (X0 and X1 ). Thus, our model predicts that when individuals
have either self-control problems or knowledge constraints, they make errors that
lead them not to behave in their own best interest or to make decisions that are
unwise even according to their own values and preferences.4

3.3 Policy implications
This subsection analyzes interventions that may be part of an appropriate portfolio
of government policies to combat self-control problems and knowledge constraints
to prevent people from becoming overweight or obese.
A growing literature argues that people with self-control problems impose
negative externalities on their future selves. If we think of a person as consisting of
multiple selves (the present self who wishes to indulge in transient pleasures versus
the future self who wishes to be healthy, as we assume in our model), the present
self’s choices can force externalities on the future self. Those within-person
externalities are known as ‘‘internalities’’ (Whitman 2006). Individuals have a
systematic tendency to pay too little attention to costs and beneﬁts of decisions to
their future selves. As a result, they engage in excessive amounts of certain
activities, such as eating—which is indeed one of the predictions of our model.
The harm resulting from an internality might be avoided in more than one way.
For instance, people can ﬁnd ways to negotiate with each other to exploit
4

Note that to prove the results we have assumed that the food price should be low enough (see Eqs. 3.4,
3.5) such that food consumption is above the threshold level that maximizes health. This has certainly
within a person can make deals; such deals are called ‘‘interpersonal bargains’’
(Whitman 2006).5 However, given the difﬁculty of internally enforcing those
bargains, or contracts, it stands to reason that people do not always succeed in
exercising self-control. This suggests a rationale for government interventions
aimed at addressing self-control problems to induce individuals to make better
health decisions. However, these policies should not prevent people from behaving
in their own best interests. Ideally, these policies should create beneﬁts for those
who do not make reliable decisions in their best interest while be harmless to those
that make reliable decisions.
In addition, if consumers do not have enough information to make informed
choices, or if they do not fully understand or accurately perceive the risks and
consequences of their choices, they may behave in a way that does not actually
match their preferences or maximize their welfare. For instance, they may choose
poor diets simply because they do not know which diets are healthy. This suggests
that private decision-making in health may lead to inefﬁcient outcomes and points
to a potential role for cost-effective policies.
It is worth noting that most of the interventions discussed in this subsection come
from the USA. Applying insights from these interventions into problems in LAC
countries is a promising area of research.
3.3.1 Information and knowledge
There is scarce evidence on policy interventions that attempt to reduce the
knowledge gap in the context of obesity. The main policy response has been to
enhance access to information, but despite the sound rationale underlying this
approach, the evidence supporting it is mixed at best.
A number of recent randomized control trials have found little conclusive
evidence that the provision of nutrition information can actually change consumer
behavior. Tandon et al. (2010) randomized the provision of information on the
nutrition content of McDonald’s meals to a group of 100 parents and found no
signiﬁcant difference in the caloric content of the meal selected. Harnack et al.
(2008) conducted a randomized 2 9 2 factorial experiment in which 594
participants ordered a fast-food meal from one of four menus that varied with
respect to whether calorie information was provided and whether value-size pricing
was used.6 The results showed that providing calorie information at the point of
purchase had little effect on food selection and consumption.
In contrast, Roberto et al. (2010) found some impact on behavior when
participants in a study dinner (n = 303) were randomly assigned to either (1) a
5

All of us face self-control problems from time to time. Whitman (2006) argues that we can ﬁnd ways to
solve, or at least mitigate, those problems. One way is to make deals with ourselves. For instance, we can
reward ourselves for good behavior and punish ourselves for bad behavior, make promises and advertise
them to friends and families, or make commitments to change our own behavior.

6

Value-size pricing involves structuring product prices such that the per unit cost decreases as the
portion size increases. It has been speculated that this product pricing structure leads to greater intake
calorie labels and a label stating the recommended daily caloric intake for an
average adult (calorie labels plus information). Participants assigned to the calorie
label group consumed less than the no calorie labels group at the dinner, but
compensated by overconsuming in the period following the meal. The group that
received both the nutrition information and dietary recommendations consumed less
than the other groups.
There are at least two reasons why improving access to information may be
insufﬁcient to promote weight loss or improve diet. First, overeating often stems
from self-control problems that occur despite full knowledge of consequences
(O’Donoghue and Rabin 2000). Second, several informational interventions look at
behaviors without evaluating whether the information is absorbed and understood.
As our model describes, individuals lag in their knowledge behind best practice
techniques. Therefore, there might be a gap between what is recommended and the
techniques actually used by people. When people do not understand the underlying
process and cannot easily infer the beneﬁts of a particular behavior, the transmission
of information might be ineffective. To understand the beneﬁts of health inputs,
people would have to understand the complex biological process that determines
health risks and the role that using health inputs plays in altering those processes.
For instance, Hawthorne at al. (2006) suggest that skills for using nutritional
information must be built up before the information provided can be effectively
used. In this vein, Prina and Royer (2013) measured the effect of delivering body
weight report cards to parents of elementary school students on parental knowledge,
obesity-related attitudes and behaviors, and BMI. In this experiment, children were
randomized into a control group and three treatment groups. What distinguished the
three treatment groups was the received level of information. The authors found that
weight report cards are an effective means of transmitting obesity information to
parents, since they became more informed. However, they found no changes in
parents’ action and self-reported behaviors as a result of having that increased
information. Nor did they ﬁnd any detectable effects on BMI or weight. The authors
suggest that to observe meaningful behavioral changes, it is necessary that parental
concerns about obesity change. Overall, these results show that the provision of
weight report cards is simply not enough to induce behavioral changes, despite the
positive effects on parental information.
Another way to deliver information is through targeted counseling and outreach
to populations at risk of becoming obese. These interventions can be quite diverse,
and their effectiveness in inﬂuencing dietary behavior may depend on programmatic
features such as setting (primary care facilities versus other types of facilities),
community-based group or individual counseling, interview style (e.g., motivational), and medium of communication (e.g., tailored feedback through e-mail). The
interventions discussed here involve programs that have some element of personal
contact and tailoring. These programs can also be combined with behavioral
interventions, which are strategies to help people acquire skills, motivation, and
support to change diet and exercise patterns. Indeed, behavioral economics suggests
that feedback on one’s progress toward achieving a goal can increase both
trial that tested the role of feedback through SMS messages found that daily
messages enhanced adherence to self-monitoring and increased weight loss (Burke
et al. 2012).
Several randomized control trials have demonstrated that these types of programs
can be an effective way to improve dietary consumptions and weight loss. Tailoring
has generally been found to be more successful than nontailored methods in
changing dietary behavior (Campbell et al. 1994; Delichatsios et al. 2001; Kristal
et al. 2000). In a study conducted by Tuomilehto et al. (2001), participants were
randomly assigned to one group that received individualized counseling aimed at
reducing weight, increasing physical activity, and participating in sessions with
nutritionists (intervention group), and another group that only received general
information about diet and exercise (control group). They found that the net weight
loss of the intervention group was 3.5 ± 5.5 kg while that of the control group was
0.8 ± 4.4 kg. Hardcastle et al. (2008) conducted a randomized trial to compare a
counseling intervention with a more standard intervention (a health promotion
leaﬂet) among 334 mostly obese patients. Individuals were randomized into either
an intervention group that received standard exercise and nutrition information plus
up to ﬁve face-to-face counseling sessions over 6 months, or into a control group
that only received the standard information. The results showed that in the sixth
month, participants in the intervention group were more active, particularly with
respect to walking, and had reduced weight, blood pressure and cholesterol, but had
not changed their diet, compared with the control group.
Increasingly, cost-conscious providers are exploring ways to deliver tailored
interventions that do not incur the same substantial costs as personal sessions. Some
examples of these interventions include messaging by telephone, e-mail, and SMS,
and computer-assisted counseling. In particular, interventions using telephone
counseling have seen signiﬁcant improvements in diet, physical activity, and weight
loss. Furthermore, these outcomes were more likely to be maintained over time. In a
study by Patrick et al. (2009), participants were randomly assigned to one of two
recipient groups over 16 weeks: (1) one group that received monthly printed
materials about weight control (comparison group); and (2) a second group that was
subject to an intervention that included personalized SMS and MMS messages sent
two to ﬁve times daily, printed materials, and brief monthly phone calls from a
health counselor (intervention group). The results showed that at the end of
4 months, the intervention group lost more weight than the comparison group.
3.3.2 Present bias and behavioral economics
Policies addressing consumer behavior will not achieve a ﬁrst-best outcome if they
do not account for consumers’ time inconsistency. Our model shows that consumers
with time-inconsistent preferences may well spend more than is optimal on food
and, in consequence, make suboptimal decisions. Time-inconsistent consumers will
have a demand for commitment mechanisms that can be used to induce more
appropriate behavior in the present. Unfortunately, the private market only
exercise routine.
In light of the ﬁndings that people regularly deviate from a rational model of
behavior, and that such deviations can hurt their own long-term interests, behavioral
economics has focused on developing interventions that expressly take such
decision-making tendencies into account. Behavioral economists have proposed a
new approach—termed ‘‘libertarian paternalistic’’—that operates via ‘‘nudging’’
individual behavior toward self-interest. The libertarian descriptor refers to the fact
that individuals should be allowed to make their own choices. The essence of this
approach is that the same decision errors that often result in people inadvertently
harming themselves can instead help them by rearranging the details of their
decisions without formally restricting or otherwise signiﬁcantly altering their choice
sets (Luoto and Carman 2014).
Along these lines, Downs et al. (2009, 2010) proposed an intervention to deal
with present-biased preferences as well as the status quo bias. The intervention
included the design of a menu featuring healthy options on the front page of a menu
and unhealthy options at the back. Speciﬁcally, participants were instructed to select
a sandwich from a menu that varied in terms of providing (or not) caloric
recommendations and information as well as the relative convenience of healthy
sandwich options. The convenience manipulation played on present-bias preferences by adding a small and immediate additional cost to ﬁnding the unhealthy
options (having to open the menu to the back), which in theory should make the
relative costs and beneﬁts of the healthy and unhealthy options more equal. The
results suggested that highlighting the healthy options can improve people’s choices
to select more healthy fare. Those who received the menu highlighting healthy fare
were 48 % more likely to purchase a low-calorie sandwich relative to the standard
menu that had a mix of healthy and unhealthy options. This study further tested the
ability of caloric information to affect orders and found no effect.
Another way to ‘‘nudge’’ people to make better dietary choices is by providing
ﬁnancial incentives.7 These incentives can potentially increase the perceived beneﬁt
of substituting healthier foods in the long term, in this way lessening the bias toward
present preferences. An alternative hypothesis is that motivation encourages ‘‘habit
formation.’’ In other words, providing incentives to healthy behaviors such as
exercising may increase the future utility of such behaviors. If the marginal utility of
consumption today is positively correlated with historical consumption, then the
period in which people were given ﬁnancial incentives to go to the gym could also
induce them to go to the gym more often in the future, leading to habit formation
(Charness and Gneezy 2009). However, studies indicate that, in some situations,
providing rewards may be counterproductive, as providing an extrinsic motivation
for a task or activity may crowd out intrinsic motivation (Fishbach and Trope 2005;
Lepper et al. 1973; Deci 1972).
7

Certain interventions could be viewed as neoclassical or behavioral, depending on the context. One
could argue that ﬁnancial incentives are clearly in the realm of neoclassical economics. However,
incentives can also be used to address behavioral biases, either by raising the salience of a desired
behavior or by addressing issues of self-control. In such instances, the incentives can be classiﬁed also as
lotteries. Consistent with prospect theory, a small probability of a large reward may
be more motivating than a certain award of the same expected value (Luoto and
Carman 2014).
Commitment mechanisms are another way to help address the problem of time
inconsistency. Broadly, a commitment mechanism is an arrangement entered into by
an individual with the aim of helping fulﬁll a plan for future behavior that would
otherwise be difﬁcult owing to intrapersonal conﬂict stemming from, for example, a
lack of self-control (Bryan et al. 2010). An example of a commitment mechanism
would be the payment of a gym membership by the month rather than by the day to
increase the cost of skipping a session. These types of mechanisms can be used to
help address the problem of time inconsistency by allowing a present self to make
decisions on behalf of its future self in cases when the two selves may differ in their
preferences.
The empirical literature regarding the provision of ﬁnancial incentives and
commitment mechanisms among obese people suggests that such incentives can be
effective in promoting dietary change in the short term. For instance, Volpp et al.
(2008) conducted a randomized control trial that involved the assignment of healthy
volunteers to one of three types of programs: (1) a weight-monitoring program
involving monthly weigh-ins, which acted as the control group; (2) the same
program with one of two ﬁnancial incentive plans in the form of a lottery
(participants who met the weight loss target had a 1 in 5 chance each day of winning
a small reward, and a 1 in 100 chance of winning a large reward); and (3) standard
treatment plus a commitment contract (participants put their own money at risk,
which they would lose if they failed to lose weight). The results showed that the
incentive group lost signiﬁcantly more weight than the control group after
16 weeks. However, behavior reverted back to almost exactly what it was initially
once the incentives were dropped, and substantial weight was regained. Finkelstein
et al. (2007) found that, over a 3-month period, participants offered $14 per
percentage point of weight loss lost 4.7 pounds, and participants offered $7 per
percentage point of weight loss lost 3 pounds compared with 2 pounds among
control group participants (see Wall et al. 2006 for a systematic review).
There is also literature on ﬁnancial incentives for gym attendance. Charness and
Gneezy (2009) conducted two randomized ﬁeld experiments that offered incentives
for university students to attend a gym a number of times during 1 month. In the
ﬁrst experiment, they compared the behavior of three groups. All groups were given
a handout regarding the beneﬁts of exercise. One group received no beneﬁts; people
in the other two groups were paid $25 to attend the gym once in a week, and people
in one of these two groups were then paid an additional $100 to attend the gym eight
more times in the following 4 weeks. In the second experiment, people were invited
to a ﬁrst meeting in which biometric measures were taken and handouts distributed
regarding the beneﬁts of exercise. Participants were paid $75 for attending and were
then invited to come twice more. They were promised $50 for each of the two later
meetings. They were randomly assigned to three groups: one with no additional
requirements, a second that required attending the gym once during the 1-month
gym eight times in a month, as the rate of gym visits after the intervention increased
signiﬁcantly in both experiments. The study also found improvements in health
indicators such as weight, waist size, and pulse rate. The authors concluded that
merely providing information about the beneﬁts of exercise or even requiring one
gym visit did not have much of an effect.
Using a ﬁeld intervention to exogenously shift preferences toward gym
attendance in a student sample, Acland and Levy (2013) conﬁrmed the results
found by Charness and Gneezy (2009)—that is, people do establish a signiﬁcant
exercise habit, but only in the short run.
Several longer term studies, such as studies by Kramer et al. (1986) and Jeffery
and Wing (1995), did not ﬁnd any effects on weight loss among study participants
after 30 months of treatment. Furthermore, a meta-analysis of nine studies
conducted by Paul-Ebhohimhen and Avenell (2008) found no signiﬁcant effect of
ﬁnancial incentives on weight loss or maintenance at 12 and 18 months.
In sum, empirical evidence seems to suggest that once incentives are taken away,
individuals are likely to return to their normal behavior, exhibiting bounded
willpower and ignoring the future beneﬁts of healthy behaviors. Future research
should examine ways to use incentives to induce long-term weight loss and
maintenance. This challenge is not unique to ﬁnancial incentive-based programs; it
is a challenge for weight-loss programs in general.
3.3.3 Price interventions
Government could turn to second-best policies that involve ‘‘sin’’ taxes and
subsidies to address these biases and discourage the consumption of unhealthy food.
In this case, the intervention could be warranted, on the one hand, by the damage
that being overweight or obese does to the individuals themselves (Gruber 2002).
The individual’s long-run self recognizes that he or she will overeat and would like
to reduce consumption of food. But without the help of government or a legal
commitment mechanism, the person’s current self is unable to do so. On the other
hand, obese individuals have more expensive healthcare costs for which they do not
fully pay. Instead these costs are shared among all of those in a common insurance
market. A tax would force obese individuals to bear the full cost of their unhealthy
habits and would correct the externality they currently impose on others (Luoto and
Carman 2014). Unfortunately, when the population is heterogeneous and a large
group makes reliable decisions in their best interest, this type of intervention would
be harmful to them.
‘‘Sin’’ taxes are designed to induce people to make better personal health
decisions. By raising the price of the unhealthy item, government can make the
overconsumption of food more costly for today’s self, helping achieve what the
individual’s long-term self would desire by decreasing the consumption of food
today. O’Donoghue and Rabin (2003) discuss ‘‘optimal sin taxes’’ designed to
correct self-control problems, using the speciﬁc example of overeating. They show
that imposing seemingly large sin taxes on unhealthy items while lowering taxes on
overconsume the unhealthy items due to self-control problems.
In general, the empirical literature documents that lowering the price of healthy
foods and raising the price of less-healthy alternatives have the potential to
inﬂuence purchases toward healthier food options, particularly when large
purchases are involved (Powell and Chaloupka 2009).8 For instance, Cecchini
et al. (2010) used a simulation based on pricing studies to predict that changes in
relative prices between healthy and unhealthy foods lead to reductions in fat
consumption by 0.4–0.6 % and increases in ﬁber consumption by 3.6–10.4 %.
Using a laboratory experiment, Epstein et al. (2010) examined the effects of
increasing the price of high-calorie-for-nutrient foods or reducing the price of lowcalorie-for-nutrient foods by 12.5 and 25 %, respectively, on mothers’ purchases of
68 common foods and drinks. They found that taxing less-healthy foods with lownutrient density-reduced caloric intake and reduced the proportion of fat while
increasing the proportion of protein purchased.
Despite this suggestive evidence, there are few studies that have attempted to
measure the effects of taxation on health outcomes. One exception is the study by
Miljkovic and Nganje (2008) that shows that a $1 increase in the price of sugar is
associated with a 0.20 and 0.33 percentage point reduction in the probability of
being overweight or obese, respectively (see also Powell et al. 2007).
There are some caveats that should be taken into account when these policies are
analyzed. First, people may respond to the price change by substituting the taxed
unhealthy item with another unhealthy item that is not included in the policy.
Fletcher et al. (2010) investigated the potential of soft drink taxes to combat rising
levels of adolescent obesity. Their results suggest that taxation leads to a moderate
reduction in soft drink consumption, but that this reduction is completely offset by
increases in consumption of other high-calorie drinks. Schroeter et al. (2008) shows
that there are plausible scenarios where taxes on certain types of food (e.g., food
away from home) could lead to increases in body weight simply due to substitution
among types of food. Second, if people do not understand the risk of obesity, these
kinds of policies may be less successful because of unintended consequences. For
example, Waterlander et al. (2012) found that although offering subsidies on healthy
foods increases the amounts purchased, the proportion of healthy foods to total
purchases remained unchanged, as people used those savings to purchase more
calories overall.
In sum, while evidence has revealed increases in purchases of healthier foods
when the prices of such foods are reduced, as well as reductions in purchases of
less-healthy foods when their prices are increased, more research is needed on the
impact of these policies on health outcomes and on what pricing strategies would be
optimal for addressing excess food consumption and rising rates of obesity. For
example, if the goal is to decrease caloric intake, is it better to subsidize healthy
foods, tax unhealthy foods, or implement both a tax and a subsidy policy? This
answer remains unknown.

According to demographic and epidemiological transitions, LAC has become
increasingly vulnerable to the impact of NCDs. Improved access to healthcare, early
detection, and timely treatment constitute an effective approach to reducing the
impact of NCDs (Alwan 2011). In this context, the provision of health insurance
plays an important role. This section focuses on health insurance programs, ﬁrst
discussing the rationales for creating health insurance programs and then brieﬂy
setting out the choices that deﬁne particular health insurance programs.
4.1 The rationale of health insurance
Health is a person’s multidimensional state of physical and psychological wellbeing. The health that people can expect to experience in any given year is a
function of their health stock, the probabilities with which they are hit by health
shocks, and the nature and quality of the healthcare they would receive. Health
shocks are a troubling source of risk for all households because if such shocks come
to pass, households must either obtain care and pay high out-of-pocket fees or forgo
care and suffer the physical and economic consequences of ill health.
Some households attempt to protect themselves against the burden of future
health shocks by purchasing health insurance, which is a contract where the
household agrees to pay a fee or premium in exchange for the promise of
indemnities, or ﬁnancial assistance with paying healthcare bills, when a family
member experience a covered health shock. For households with the ﬁnancial means
to pay for care when hit by shocks, such contracts reduce vulnerability to ﬁnancial
shocks and poverty. For those who would have forgone care when hit by health
shocks, such contracts improve their health by allowing them to obtain healthcare.
If insurance markets were free of information problems and if insurance
transactions were costless to carry out, insurers would come forward to supply
health insurance to many households while charging premiums that households are
willing to pay. They could supply insurance at such premiums while covering costs,
because they would beneﬁt from risk pooling.9 The existence of a well-functioning
health insurance market would allow for a redistribution of income from those who
remain healthy to those who become sick, while leaving everyone better off because
even those who ultimately remain healthy would beneﬁt (ex ante) from reduced risk.
However, markets are unlikely to yield high-quality and efﬁcient healthcare in
the absence of intervention for several reasons. Most households may not be
sufﬁciently forward-looking, so the cost of possible out-of-pocket healthcare
expenditures receives little weight in current consumption decisions. They also lack
expert medical knowledge and thus have much less information than providers
about the quality and necessity of the care provided. Providers might take advantage
of this asymmetry of information by charging high fees for low-quality care, and
ﬁnancial market limitations can render it difﬁcult for healthcare providers to
9

Insurers engage in risk pooling when they take on liability for the cost of any necessary healthcare for
demands for care and inﬂows of user-fee revenue. Failure of insurance markets may,
therefore, be understood as contributing to two critical symptoms of the failure of
the healthcare system in the absence of intervention: low rates of healthcare
utilization and high rates of impoverishment among those who obtain care.
The logic of health insurance market failures suggests that where households
must pay signiﬁcant user fees for healthcare, governments may be able to increase
healthcare utilization and reduce the ﬁnancial burden associated with care by
introducing new health insurance programs (Schaffner 2013). As always, while
logic suggests the potential for health insurance programs to generate beneﬁts at low
cost, it does not guarantee that in practice the beneﬁts will be large and the cost low.
The nature and magnitude of the impact of such programs are likely to depend on
the details of program design, as will be discussed in the following subsection.
4.2 Design of health insurance programs
Health insurance programs have the potential to improve healthcare quality and
efﬁciency by creating a new institutional interface between healthcare consumers
and suppliers, which improves the governance of healthcare management. The new
institutional arrangements can help healthcare consumers coordinate their demands
and negotiate better contractual arrangements. Further efﬁciency gains may be
obtained when health insurance programs encourage households to make more
efﬁcient use of the healthcare system. For instance, by covering primary care visits,
health insurance can encourage households to enter the healthcare system at an
earlier stage of illness, when treatment is more effective and less costly (Schaffner
2013).
However, the potential beneﬁts of health insurance programs depend on the
details of the program design. Health insurance programs differ greatly in their
coverage. Some programs offer coverage for catastrophic health shocks that are lifethreatening and require hospitalization or costly medication. Other programs offer
coverage for the smaller and more frequent costs of primary healthcare services,
including the diagnosis and treatment of common illnesses.
Within any category of covered health shocks and treatments, the generosity of
coverage is deﬁned by deductibles, coinsurance rates, and caps on out-of-pocket
spending or indemnity payments. In some programs, participants must pay out-ofpocket for healthcare costs up to speciﬁed deductible levels (per health shock
episode or per year)10 before additional costs are covered by indemnities, Other
programs offer ﬁrst dollar coverage (i.e., zero deductible). Very generous programs
might cover 100 % of healthcare costs beyond the deductible level, while others
might cover only 60 %, thereby imposing a 40 % coinsurance rate on participants.
Some programs impose per-episode out-of-pocket payments caps, promising to
cover any costs in excess of that cap, while others impose insurer payment caps,
requiring participants to cover any cost over the cap. In addition, programs differ in
10
Deductible levels are minimum amounts of expenditure that the insured person must bear before the
levels or demographic characteristics.
A ﬁnal distinguishing design feature is whether participation is mandatory or
voluntary. Many of the oldest health insurance programs in developing countries are
mandatory for all formal sector workers (and their families). The mandate is
enforced using payroll taxes to deduct premiums before workers receive their pay.
In LAC, mandatory programs were introduced as far back as the 1930s and cover
over half of the population (see Sect. 5). In poorer countries, however, very few
people work in the formal sector, and mandatory programs might cover as little as
10 % of the population. In programs targeting the many developing-country
households outside the formal sector, participation is voluntary (Schaffner 2013).

5 Institutional overview of health insurance programs in Latin America
and the Caribbean
The organization and supply of health insurance varies widely across countries.
While most high-income countries have evolved toward the public provision of
health insurance, attained near-universal coverage and increased the degree of
ﬁnancial risk protection, access to care and risk protection in middle-income
countries remains a policy concern. In these countries, targeted safety net programs
complement a small private insurance market, limiting coverage to selected beneﬁts
and groups. Private insurance markets are generally fragmented, and the use of
regulatory instruments, such as risk adjustment, remains limited (McGuire 2012).
Regarding LAC, most countries have reformed their healthcare system. These
reforms have been focused mainly on promoting ﬁnancial, structural, and
institutional changes in health systems while much less attention has been devoted
to enhancing the performance of health systems with the focus on reducing
inequities in health conditions and access to healthcare (PAHO 2002, 138). In a
large majority of countries, a tripartite healthcare system has emerged with diverse
roles of the public, social insurance, and private sectors, varying degrees of
population coverage and separation of functions (Mesa-Lago 2008).
Social insurance plays an important role in the provision of health insurance in
the region. Its design is based on the Bismarck model, where social insurance
entitlements are proportional to the mandatory contributions made by workers and
their employers (Ribe et al. 2012). Under this design, the coverage is limited by the
method of ﬁnancing. While all workers are exposed to the risks, even under full
compliance, only those in the formal sector are actually insured; hence, selfemployed workers and those engaged with ﬁrms under nonsalaried contracts are left
out (Levy 2008).
`
The public sector plays a secondary role vis-a-vis social insurance, as it has
insufﬁcient resources and limited access, and provides low-quality services. Finally,
there is a signiﬁcant variety of private entities and plans partly because health
reforms have stimulated the expansion and competition of the private sector.

Lat Am Econ Rev (2015) 24:11

private insurance ﬁrms and providers practice risk selection (cream skimming),
excluding or charging higher premiums to those who either suffer chronic
diseases or are elderly, and as a consequence those enduring greater risk must
pay higher copayments that they often cannot afford;
competition is centered on the most attractive groups and avoids the least
attractive groups—including the elderly or people with high risk, chronic
disease, or insufﬁcient income to ﬁnance needs derived from their epidemiological proﬁle—who are left to the public sector;
segmentation increases in countries where social insurance is not integrated
with the public sector and only covers the middle-income formal stratum
(Mesa-Lago 2008; Giordano and Colina 2000).

5.1 Health insurance coverage
Although the region lacks historical statistical series’ on coverage, Table 6, based on
Mesa-Lago (2008), compiles estimates of the percentage of the total population covered
in 19 countries. Whenever possible, the table compares the year prior to the reforms with
the most recent year available. In the table, the covered population is divided into the three
sectors (public, social insurance, and private) and the category of ‘‘others’’ (separate
schemes such as the armed forces, policemen, civil servants, etc.). Since several problems
affect the accuracy of the estimates, results should be interpreted with caution.
Considering the region as a whole, the estimated regional weighted average of the
total population covered by social insurance before and after the reform (excluding the
public systems of Brazil and Cuba) increased from 43 to 52 % from 1980 to 1990 but
decreased to 41 % in 2001. These averages are below the International Labor
Organization’s (ILO) minimum norm of 75 % coverage of the resident population.
However, an undetermined portion of the population has access to public sector
services, and to a lesser extent is covered by the private sector (3.8 % of the
population) and the ‘‘other’’ category of systems mentioned in the previous paragraph.
The population covered with social insurance varies widely within the region.
There are countries that cover almost the entire population (up to 86 %) through
social insurance, but there are others where social insurance covers only a small
minority, ranging from 0.5 % in Haiti to 16 % in Uruguay. The low health coverage
in some countries may be attributed to legal or practical exclusion of the selfemployed, agricultural workers, and informal workers. Hence, the degree of
coverage is directly related to both the level of socioeconomic development and the
proportion of the labor force that is formal, whereas it is inversely related to poverty
incidence (Mesa-Lago 2008).
The public sector does not often fulﬁll the legal mandate of free service to the
poor and uninsured in most LAC countries, so a signiﬁcant part of the population is
left without protection. In terms of private out-of-pocket expenditure in health as a
share of national health expenditure, the regional average of around 48 % in 2011 is
still far from the target of 23 %, which is the level of countries in the Organization
for Economic Cooperation and Development characterized as having universal

Nonsalaried and informal workers represent a major challenge for social health
insurance, since under contributory social insurance there is no possibility of
extending coverage to them precisely because they are outside the formal sector.
Over the last two decades some LAC countries have gradually created programs to
provide the uninsured with at least a subset of health beneﬁts adjusted to the
epidemiological and local needs of users (see Sect. 7).
In sum, over the past three decades the region has seen important reforms that
sought to improve health systems. However, the norm is still mixed and fragmented
models in which contributory and noncontributory health insurance programs
coexist. One of the implications of this situation is low ﬁnancial protection for
individuals. In addition, the increase in informal labor poses great challenges to
achieving universal healthcare coverage. This is especially relevant taking into
account the high prevalence of NCDs, which require effective health insurance
programs that provide coverage for long-term treatment.

6 The coverage of health insurance: a theoretical framework
As previously mentioned, since the second half of the twentieth century the trend in
LAC has been toward labor-based social insurance systems restricted to salaried
labor market.
In most of the informality literature, workers’ decisions play no role in
determining the equilibrium in the labor market. Galiani and Weinschelbaum (2012)
provide a model where workers have nonpecuniary preferences for the sector in
which they work. Part of these nonpecuniary preferences is health insurance plans
provided by formal ﬁrms. We assume that formal workers are covered by health
insurance and informal workers are not. Informal workers can access healthcare
resorting to either private health insurance or public hospitals. Thus, any policy that
affects workers’ health insurance may produce changes in workers’ behaviour,
affecting the size of the formal sector and consequently the quantity of workers
covered by insurance.
Speciﬁcally, Galiani and Weinschelbaum (2012) assume that ﬁrms produce a
homogenous good that is traded in a perfectly competitive market using managerial
talent (m) and homogenous units of labor (l). In the model, very small ﬁrms (i.e.,
those with managerial talent m close to 0) operate informally because of the ﬁxed
cost that they would have to incur to operate formally. As result, there is size
dualism: small ﬁrms operate informally while large ﬁrms operate formally. In
equilibrium, whenever there are both formal and informal ﬁrms, there is a unique

cutoff point (m) that satisﬁes:


Pf ðmÞ ¼ Pi ðmÞ;
where Pf and Pi are the beneﬁts perceived by the formal and informal ﬁrm,

respectively. Thus, ﬁrms with managerial talent m m choose to operate informally,

while ﬁrms with managerial talent m [ m choose to operate formally. (The complete derivation of the model is in Appendix 2.)
Each worker, endowed with l units of homogenous labor, has to choose whether
to sell his or her labor to a ﬁrm that operates either formally or informally.11 In the
ﬁrst case, workers receive wf per unit of labor plus mandated social beneﬁts, which
for simplicity sake we equate to health insurance package ðHI). In the second case,
workers receive only wi per unit of labor and we assume they receive healthcare
only in public hospitals ðPH). In addition, we assume that UðHI) [ UðPH):
The utility of a worker who chooses to work in the formal sector is:
Uf ðwf l; HIÞ ¼ wf l þ HI À c;
where c is a ﬁxed cost for working in the formal sector, such as unemployment
insurance.
The expected utility of a worker who chooses to work in the informal sector is:

11

Olson (1993), cited in Gruber (2000), provides supportive evidence of the presence of worker’s selfselection in the USA. He ﬁnds that workers with greater-than-expected health needs (e.g., wives whose
husbands do not have health insurance, and who have less-healthy children) self-select into ﬁrms that
where q is the probability that a ﬁrm is caught operating informally, in which case
workers do not receive their payment.
Under certain conditions there is a unique cutoff point ( that determines that
l)
workers with low levels of human capital will work in the informal sector and those
with high levels of human capital will be employed in the formal sector. This cutoff
point is determined by:
Uf ðwf  HIÞ ¼ Ui ðwi PHÞ;
l;
l;
and solving for  we obtain:
l
¼
l



c þ PH À HI
wf À wi ð1 À qÞ



Workers with l [  prefer to work in the formal sector, while workers with l 
l
l
operate informally (see Appendix 2 for further details). This is the ﬁrst important
result in terms of health:
Result 1 Poor, unskilled workers will be in the informal sector and will only have
public health coverage, while workers with high levels of human capital will be
employed in the formal sector and receive health insurance.12
The equilibrium analysis is restricted to the cases where there are ﬁrms and
workers operating in both the formal and informal sectors. An equilibrium is then a
vector of wages ðwf ; wi Þ, supply of labor ðlS ; lS Þ; and demand for labor (lD ; lD ) such
f i

that there is market clearing in both the formal ðf Þ and informal ðiÞ labor markets.
We will analyze the effect of an improvement in health insurance package that
formal worker receives, which is reﬂected by an increase in HI. At the prevailing
wage levels, the utility of working in the formal sector increases while the utility of
working in the informal sector remains constant. This, in turn, will reduce the
formality cutoff point for workers (in Eq. 6.1, (PH À HI) decreases); hence more
individuals would prefer to work in the formal sector. Thus, the curve of equilibrium
points in the formal sector ðlD ¼ lS Þ shifts downward, while the curve of equilibrium
f
f
points in the informal sector ðlD ¼ lS Þ shifts to the right. Since the total supply of
i
i
labor represented by workers above the original cutoff point increases, at the
prevailing wage levels there is an excess supply in the formal sector. This means
that, for a given informal wage, equilibrium in the formal sector is only achieved if
formal wages go down. The same reasoning applies to the informal sector. Finally,
since neither the total supply of labor (the total quantity of labor is supplied
inelastically) nor the total demand of labor has changed, the function ðlD þ lS ¼
f
f
lD þ lS Þ representing the wage levels that align the total supply of labor with total
i

demand for labor remains the same.
We illustrate these changes in Fig. 2, where the downward sloping curve
represents the locus of wages where total labor demand is equal to total labor

In the new equilibrium ðwÃÃ ; wÃÃ Þ the informal wage increases while the formal

wage decreases. Thus, this policy would indirectly beneﬁt informal workers through
the increase in their wages. Managerial decisions also change. At the new wage
levels, the managerial ability cutoff point is also lower than in the previous
equilibrium. Therefore, more ﬁrms choose to operate formally. Moreover, the ﬁrms
that originally were operating formally increase their total labor demand while those
that remain in the informal sector reduce their total labor demand. Thus, we have the
following result:
Result 2 An improvement in health insurance package increases the size of the
formal sector, decreases the formal wage, and increases the informal wage, thus
improving the utility of poor unskilled workers who choose the informal sector.
An increase in the quality of public hospitals,14 represented by an increase in PH,
will also affect the market labor. At the initial wage levels, the utility of working in
the informal sector increases while the utility of working in the formal sector
remains constant, which increases the formality cutoff point for workers (in Eq. 6.1,
PH À HI increases); hence more individuals would prefer to work in the informal

that the curve is downward sloping.

upward. Since the total supply of labor represented by workers below the original
cutoff point increases, at the prevailing wage levels there is an excess supply in the
informal sector. For a given formal wage, equilibrium in the informal sector is only
achieved if informal wages decrease. The same reasoning applies to the formal
sector. At the new wage levels, the managerial ability cutoff point is higher than in
the previous equilibrium, hence the size of the informal sector increases. In sum, we
obtain the following result:
Result 3 An increase in the quality of public hospitals, which reduces the
difference in health services that formal workers received through social health
insurance relative to uninsured informal workers, increases the size of the informal
sector and decreases the wages of this sector, while increasing the wages of the
formal sector.
This simple model shows that employment-based health insurance interferes with
the functioning of the labor market. This is a relevant result for policymakers, since
changes in the provision of public healthcare may have unintended consequences,
distorting workers’ incentives to operate in the informal sector.

7 The challenges of expanding health insurance coverage
As the magnitude of NCDs continues to accelerate, the pressing need for access to
quality healthcare is increasingly recognized. There are three ways of moving
toward increasing ﬁnancial accessibility to healthcare: (1) by increasing breadth
(who is insured), (2) by increasing depth (which beneﬁts are covered), and (3) by
increasing height (what proportion of the cost is covered). This subsection
investigates the ﬁrst approach to increasing accessibility, which involves expanding
health insurance to poor, unskilled workers in the informal sector.
LAC countries face the challenge of expanding health insurance coverage in a
scenario in which a large share of the labor force is employed in the informal sector.
There is little agreement among countries as to how best to expand coverage to this
sector. Under social health insurance there is no possibility of extending coverage to
nonsalaried workers. As a result, separate insurance programs adjusted to
epidemiological needs should be available for those persons who are not eligible
for health insurance through employment.
Over the years, and particularly since the mid-1990s, governments have
gradually created programs to provide the uninsured with at least a subset of the
beneﬁts that salaried workers receive through social health insurance. These health
programs have expanded markedly in scope, quality, budget, and coverage.
One of the most notable initiatives is Mexico’s Seguro Popular. Mexico’s social
security system only covers about 45 % of the population, namely formally
registered wage workers and their dependents (Aterido and Hallward-Driemeier
2011). Seguro Popular was introduced in 2002 with the aim of expanding health
beneﬁciaries pay to participate in the program. By the end of 2010, the uninsured
population had dropped to 9 million people (from 64 million in 2002) representing
only 8 % of the population (Bitran 2014). A study that summarizes results from all
published evaluations concluded that Seguro Popular improved access to health
services and reduced the prevalence of catastrophic and impoverishing health
expenditures, especially for the poor (Knaul et al. 2012).
Another example of increasing access is Colombia’s reform that has sought to
expand health insurance coverage by creating two regimes, a contributory regime
for the nonpoor and a subsidized regime for the poor.15 Afﬁliation in the
contributory regime is mandatory for dependent and independent workers whose
monthly income is greater than a legal threshold, while individuals with an income
below that threshold have to enroll in the subsidized regime. Beneﬁts in the
subsidized regime are ﬁnanced with 1 percentage point contribution by the afﬁliates
of the contributory regime plus subsidies from the nation’s Treasury. This move
toward a subsidized national health insurance system made it possible for Colombia
to achieve universal health coverage by 2009 (Bitran 2014). Furthermore, there is
evidence that the reform improved access to healthcare and ﬁnancial protection
against health shocks for beneﬁciaries (Giedion et al. 2009).
Peru complemented its social health insurance program, which covers formal
workers, with a voluntary Integral Health Insurance Program (Seguro Integral de
Salud—SIS) that covers poor and low-income individuals working in the informal
sector. Families wishing to qualify are subject to a means test, known as the
Household Targeting System. The SIS is ﬁnanced by general revenues of the
government. By the end of 2010, the proportion of uninsured Peruvians dropped
from two-thirds to one-third. However, it is important to note that expanding
nominal coverage may not necessarily lead to bridging gaps in access to health
services. In Peru, these gaps persist and are large (Bitran 2014).
Other developing countries have also applied this strategy. For instance, Vietnam
has recognized that expanding coverage based on contributory mechanisms alone is
not feasible in a context where a large share of the population is still poor, in the
informal sector, or both (Somanathan et al. 2012). Vietnam’s Health Insurance Law
of 2008 mandated enrollment of all citizens in the country’s social health insurance
agency (SHI). With the aim of promoting enrollment, certain population groups,
including the poor, are not required to make any contribution to SHI. In addition, the
government subsidizes 70 % of a ﬂat premium for the near-poor and 30 % for
medium-income farmers. Nearly 60 % of the country’s population was covered by
SHI by the end of 2010 (Bitran 2014).
Some health insurance programs are focused on speciﬁc population groups. For
instance, the Maternal-Child Health Insurance Program in Argentina, known as
Plan Nacer, has sought to reduce maternal and child mortality among uninsured
pregnant women and children through highly innovative result-based ﬁnancing
15
In 1990, Colombia adopted a new Constitution that emphasized social program spending for the poor.
Law 100 of 1993 reformed the social security system, including pensions, workplace accidents,
of the central pillars of a broader and integrated package of propoor policy reforms
intended to increase the availability of healthcare services for the uninsured. It
became a powerful tool in increasing coverage of basic services among the
uninsured population.
Another way to expand the coverage of health insurance involves public
provision of subsidized health insurance. Under this approach, insurance is
compulsory, so coverage extends to the entire population. All citizens have free
or nearly free access to healthcare at least in terms of facing zero or nearly zero
costs, regardless of whether they belong to the formal or informal sector. This
system is used in some high-income countries, including the UK, Denmark,
Norway, Australia, and New Zealand, and it predominates in some developing
countries. Probably the best known example of public provision of healthcare
services is the United Kingdom’s National Health Service, whose principal source
of ﬁnancing is general tax revenue. The National Health Service provides free care
or nearly free care to UK citizens regardless of whether they belong to the formal or
informal sector.
One of the ﬁrst LAC countries to adopt this strategy was Brazil. Starting in 1988,
Brazil abandoned its social health insurance system and created the tax-ﬁnanced
national health system (the Uniﬁed Health System—SUS), which provides
comprehensive healthcare to all Brazilians irrespective of income, location, age,
gender, or work status. The SUS uniﬁed the existing disparate contributory and
public subsystems into one coordinated national system for which the entire
population is eligible. A number of assessments of the SUS carried out over the
years have generally pointed to signiﬁcant achievements in improving access and
contributing to bringing Brazil from lagging behind its peers in terms of health
indicators to being a good performer (Couttolenc and Dmytraczenko 2013).
In the developing world, Thailand’s Universal Coverage Scheme stands out as a
widely publicized reform that sought to move away from the fragmented health
system, which included a social health insurance component, to an integrated
system ﬁnanced through general tax revenues. Prior to the reform, one-third of the
population lacked health insurance coverage, mostly informal sector workers. A
review by the Health Insurance System Research Ofﬁce (2012) reported that
impoverishment among informal sector workers dropped as a result of the universal
coverage reform. Health insurance coverage in Thailand is now universal (Bitran
2014).
For a more radical reform, Levy (2008) proposes converting existing systems of
social security for formal workers into universal social entitlements, in which health
insurance would be included. He advocates eliminating wage-based social security
contributions and raising consumption taxes on higher income households to
improve beneﬁts for workers, among other objectives.
Thus, in thinking about ways to provide health insurance to poor, unskilled
workers in the informal sector—who represent a large proportion of the workforce
in a context where NCDs are commonplace—social health insurance systems
Informality makes health insurance reform difﬁcult, while at the same time health
insurance reforms themselves may encourage informality because subsidized health
insurance programs can increase the size of the informal sector. In other words, the
coexistence of social health insurance programs with publicly subsidized health
insurance plans that cover poor, unskilled workers in the informal sector can
provide incentives for formal sector workers to switch to informal employment. By
doing so, workers can avoid having to make otherwise mandatory contributions to
the social health insurance system while receiving some free services under the new
program. However, there is scarce robust empirical evidence, based on randomized
control trials, of the actual effect of these programs on workers’ choices of formal or
informal employment in the region.
For instance, Camacho et al. (2009) examine whether publicly provided health
insurance in Colombia discouraged formal employment. Using a difference-indifference approach they found that informal employment was approximately 4
percentage points higher than it would have been in the absence of the reform.16 The
estimation includes year and municipality ﬁxed effects as well as individual,
household, and labor market controls.
A similar phenomenon seems to have occurred in Mexico. Aterido and HallwardDriemeier (2011) examine whether Mexico’s subsidized health insurance program
for the poor, Seguro Popular, had the unintended consequence of promoting
informal employment. Their identiﬁcation strategy relies on the variation in the
rollout of Seguro Popular across municipalities and time, with the difference-indifference estimation controlling for household ﬁxed effects. These authors ﬁnd that
the program lowers formality by 0.4–0.7 percentage points.
Thus, there appears to be a trade-off between the expansion of subsidized health
insurance programs and workers’ choices of informal employment. Given the high
rates of informality in LAC and the need to expand access to healthcare to the
uninsured, long-term evaluation of the impact of publicly subsidized health
insurance programs on the informal market is a research priority. Along these lines,
it is also crucial to assess the effects of these programs on health status. The
empirical evidence on the extent to which public health insurance programs improve
health outcomes is very limited (Sloan and Hsieh 2012).
A better understanding of the distortions generated by these programs and the
magnitude of their effects on both health status and informality is central to inform
policy decisions. Thus, a suggested area for research is on the way to use robust
experimental evidence to establish with conﬁdence the impact of subsidized health
insurance programs on labor informality and health.

The introduction of public health insurance programs may lead to moral hazard
problems, which refers to the effect of insurance on the behavior of the insured.
Ehrlich and Becker (1972) describe two different types of behavioral change,
namely ‘‘ex-post moral hazard’’ and ‘‘ex-ante moral hazard.’’ Ex-ante moral hazard
refers to the situation prior to the advent of illness; speciﬁcally, it describes the
phenomenon in which the insured engage less in preventive behaviors because the
cost of treating illness is lower with insurance coverage. Ex post moral hazard, by
way of contrast, comes into play once the health loss has already occurred. At this
stage, individuals increase consumption of healthcare because health insurance has
reduced the price of healthcare.
Moral hazard is a concern because it conﬂicts with risk-spreading goals.
Insurance is valuable because it allows people to transfer income from when they
need it less to when they need it more. But this transfer is not perfect because people
may increase their consumption of medical care when it is subsidized. This creates
an inherent second-best problem in designing insurance policies: insurers must trade
off the beneﬁts from spreading more risk against the cost of increased moral hazard
(Cutler and Zeckhauser 2000).
One of the criteria that the literature has proposed for designing public health
insurance programs is to minimize the efﬁciency loss resulting from the introduction
of health insurance (Sloan and Hsieh 2012). The moral hazard problem leads to
welfare loss because the social cost of increased consumption in healthcare exceeds
the corresponding social beneﬁt. The magnitude of welfare loss resulting from
moral hazard depends on the price elasticity of demand for personal healthcare
services. A higher elasticity, which means a higher responsiveness of healthcare
demand to price changes, leads to a larger welfare loss. This suggests that health
services with, respectively, low price elasticities should be given higher priority as
candidates for inclusion in public health programs than health services with higher
price elasticities. For instance, the price elasticity of inpatient care is lower than the
price elasticity of outpatient care (Newhouse 1993). Thus, almost all health
insurance programs provide coverage for hospital care because of its lower price
elasticity. In contrast, some insurance programs may exclude coverage of outpatient
services because the utilization of such services is often more responsive to price
changes (Sloan and Hsieh 2012).
Health insurance programs can also mitigate moral hazard by requiring providers
to follow speciﬁed protocols for care, and by covering only a list of essential
healthcare services. Still another way is to increase cost sharing, that is, the share of
the payment to the provider that the insured consumer bears. While the increase in
cost sharing increases expenditure, it reduces moral hazard. Thus, using tools to
balance moral hazard and risk protection are important for the design of public
health insurance programs.
One advantage of the direct public provision of health insurance, applied
compulsorily to everyone, is that it avoids adverse selection by health insurance
differences. In other words, with many insurance products available, healthy
individuals may tend to buy lower cost policies offering less coverage, such as plans
with higher deductibles, coinsurance, or co-pays, since they do not expect to
become ill. By contrast, persons in poor health may demand more complete
coverage. Under public provision of health insurance everyone is insured under the
same terms, hence adverse selection is not an issue.
In theory, adverse selection can lead to the unraveling of insurance markets
(Rothschild and Stiglitz 1976). Not knowing each insured’s health risk, insurers
frequently do not charge sufﬁciently different premiums to high-risk versus low-risk
individuals. Thus, for any premium that allows the insurer to break even, insurance
is an attractive purchase for the high-risk but not low-risk individuals. As a result,
fewer low-risk persons demand insurance. To break even on the remaining persons
it covers, the insurer must raise premiums. But at higher premiums, some people
who bought insurance before decide against buying insurance. These are the lower
risk subgroup of the higher risk group that purchased insurance. Again, with the
resulting higher risk pool of insureds, the insurer ﬁnds that its premium income is
insufﬁcient. So it raises premiums again, and the healthier persons in this group drop
out of the insurance market. This process of unraveling could continue until only a
very few high-risk individuals remain in the market. All the rest of the population is
rendered worse off because they have lost a mechanism for reducing expenditure
risk at premiums that are appropriate for the health expenditures they are likely to
incur (Sloan and Hsieh 2012).
There are several approaches for dealing with adverse selection. As mentioned
earlier, one way is to eliminate a choice of insurance plan and to provide a single
public health insurance program. However, lack of choice may be welfare reducing
in that less-risk-adverse individuals would purchase less comprehensive policies
than would more-risk-averse individuals if choices were available (McGuire 2012).

8 Conclusions
The last 50 years in LAC have seen improvements in overall levels of health and life
expectancy as well as reductions in infant mortality. Although the region is not
completely free of infectious diseases, it is well advanced in its demographic and
epidemiological transitions, with health problems highly concentrated on NCDs.
This rise of NCDs poses many new challenges for public policy and the effective
delivery of health services.
To address these challenges policymakers must deﬁne a health policy frontier
that identiﬁes primary interventions according to current health priorities. Thus,
taking into account where LAC stands in terms of its demographic and
epidemiological transitions, this paper proposes that the health policy frontier must
include (1) public health policies that reduce the risk factors that cause NCDs by
promoting healthy behavior, and (2) health insurance programs that offer
households effective access to quality healthcare at costs that do not impoverish
contribute to the growing trend of NCDs—such as tobacco use, unhealthy diets, and
physical inactivity—has the potential to reduce at least part of this disease burden
(WHO 2013a). Nevertheless, traditional policy tools that are largely informed by a
rational model of behavior have in many instances fallen short (Luoto and Carman
2014).
Regarding health behavior, there is evidence that people face self-control
problems and knowledge constraints, which may lead them to make suboptimal
decisions. This paper has developed a simple theoretical model that predicts the
impact of those biases on people’s behavior related to food consumption, which
later leads to weight problems and obesity. The comparative static of the model,
which assesses the impact of caloric intake on health, shows that increases in the
gap between best practices and what an individual actually believes lead to an
overconsumption of food. Similarly, reductions in the discount parameter, which
make consumers less forward-looking (i.e., they worry less about their future), lead
to a more present-oriented consumption that is reﬂected in the overconsumption of
food. Thus, the model predicts that a consumer with self-control problems and
knowledge gaps may well spend more than is optimal on food.
This suggests that private decision-making in health can lead to inefﬁcient
outcomes and points to a potential role for cost-effective policies. Looking across
the spectrum of health behaviors, behavioral economics offers insights that seem to
hold promise for cost-effective public interventions. Policies that combine the
provision of information with counseling and with elements of behavioral
economics, such as incentives or commitment mechanisms, appear as a promise
to combat weight problems and obesity. However, the empirical literature suggests
that providing incentives may only be effective in the short term. Therefore, an
avenue for future research is identifying which interventions are the most cost
effective in achieving healthy behaviors in the long term.
In the absence of these cost-effective interventions, policymakers could have to
turn to second-best policies that involve ‘‘sin’’ taxes and subsidies to discourage the
consumption of unhealthy food. Unfortunately, when the population is heterogeneous and a large group makes reliable decisions in their best interest, this type of
intervention would be harmful to them. The overall evidence documents that price
manipulations have the potential to encourage healthier eating, particularly when
those manipulations are large. Nevertheless, improving the understanding of how
changes in prices affect health outcomes and what pricing strategies would be
optimal for addressing excess food consumption and rising rates of obesity is
another research priority.
Apart from prevention, effective approaches to reduce the impact of NCDs
should include broad access to healthcare for people with and at risk of NCDs. The
provision of health insurance plays an important role because it increases health and
ﬁnancial security for many people. Since health insurance in LAC is mostly
provided within the labor market, effective access to healthcare services is restricted
to workers in the formal sector, excluding an informal sector that encompasses
approximately 50 % of the region’s labor force. In this context, we are left with the
for policy interventions proposed in this paper is social health insurance systems
combined with publicly subsidized health insurance programs, as well as taxﬁnanced systems of public health.
It is important to note that a potential unintended consequence of combining
social health insurance with publicly subsidized health insurance programs is the
perverse incentive it may create for formal sector workers to switch to informal
employment. By doing so, workers could avoid having to make mandatory
contributions to the social health insurance system while receiving some free
services under the new program. The model presented in this paper shows that
improvements in the provision of public healthcare will increase the size of the
informal sector and decrease the wages of this sector. However, there is scarce
empirical evidence of the effect of these interventions on workers’ choices of formal
or informal employment in the region. Thus, a suggested area of research is on how
to use robust experimental evidence to establish with conﬁdence the impact of
subsidized health insurance programs on informality and health.
Finally, the introduction of public health insurance programs can lead to
problems of moral hazard, which refers to the effect of insurance on the behavior of
the insured. One of the criteria that the literature has proposed for designing public
health insurance programs is to minimize the efﬁciency loss resulting from the
introduction of health insurance. Policymakers have to balance moral hazard and
risk protection in the design of public health insurance programs.

10 Appendix 2: Health insurance and informality: model structure17
There are three types of economic agents: ﬁrms, workers, and the government;
however, this framework only models the behavior of the ﬁrst two agents.
Firms produce a homogenous good that is traded in a perfectly competitive
market using managerial talent (m) and homogenous units of labor (l). We assume
that the production function is Cobb–Douglas with constant returns to scale, thereby
presenting diminishing returns to labor. There is a continuum of ﬁrms indexed by
their innate managerial talent and distributed with density function g(m) with
support in R?. Each ﬁrm in the economy chooses whether to operate formally or
informally and decides how many units of labor it will hire to produce its output. If a
ﬁrm operates in the formal sector of the economy, its proﬁt function is given by:

17
This appendix is mainly a summary of the model developed by Galiani and Weinschelbaum (2012).
where mb l1Àb is the Cobb–Douglas production function, wf is the prevailing wage
per unit of labor paid to workers in the formal sector (i.e., ﬁrms are wage-takers), t is
the payroll tax levied on ﬁrms, and s is a ﬁxed cost incurred by ﬁrms that operate
formally. If, on the other hand, a ﬁrm operates informally, then its expected proﬁt
function is given by:
Pi ðmÞ ¼ ðmb l1Àb À wi lÞð1 À qÞ;
where wi is the prevalent wage per unit of labor paid to workers in the informal
sector and q is the probability that a ﬁrm is caught operating informally, in which
case it will be closed and will lose its current proﬁts.
Firms choose l to maximize proﬁts. Under the assumptions made, the derived
labor demand for a ﬁrm with managerial talent m is

if it operates informally. Note that both demand functions are linear in managerial
talent. Thus, the size of a ﬁrm (assuming that it does not switch sectors), measured
by l, is linearly increasing in m.
Very small ﬁrms (i.e., those with managerial talent m close to 0) operate informally
because of the ﬁxed cost s that they would have to incur to operate formally. As in
Rauch (1991), there is size dualism: small ﬁrms operate informally while large ﬁrms
operate formally. When there are ﬁrms operating formally and the proﬁt functions
satisfy the following condition, there is a unique cutoff point in ﬁrm size:

Workers are endowed with l units of homogenous labor. There is a continuum
of workers indexed by their endowment of labor and distributed with density
function h(l) with support in R?. Thus, wages are set for units of substitutable labor. Each worker has to choose whether to sell his/her labor to a ﬁrm that operates
formally or to a ﬁrm that operates informally. Workers cannot split their units of
labor between different ﬁrms. In the ﬁrst case, the worker receives wf per unit of
labor plus mandated social beneﬁts. In the second case, the worker receives only
wi per unit of labor and we assume the worker receives healthcare only in public
hospitals ðPH).
The utility of a worker who chooses to work in the formal sector is:
Uf ðwf l; HIÞ ¼ wf l þ HI À c;
where HI are the nonpecuniary beneﬁts that, for simplicity sake, we equate with a
government-provided health insurance package that we assume covers all members
of the worker’s family.18,19
Workers also incur a ﬁxed cost c for working in the formal sector. This
includes not only the direct costs (De Soto 1989) but also, and perhaps more
importantly, indirect costs such as unemployment insurance and other subsidies,
such as cash transfers, that a worker would have to disregard when he or she
accepts a formal job.
When an informal ﬁrm is detected, its workers do not receive their payment. The
expected utility of a worker who chooses to work in the informal sector is:
Ui ðwi l; PHÞ ¼ wi lð1 À qÞ þ PH;
where PH represents the health services that informal workers received in the public
health sector.
When there are workers in both the formal and the informal sector and the utility
functions satisfy the following condition, then there is a unique cutoff point that
determines that workers with low levels of human capital will be in the informal
sector and those with high levels of human capital will be employed in the formal
sector:

18
Although for the sake of simplicity we equate mandated social beneﬁts with a health insurance
package that provides better health coverage than public hospitals, there are other mandated beneﬁts
associated with formal jobs that affect workers’ payoffs similarly. Examples are pensions and family
allowances.
19
There is a large literature in the United States that shows that health insurance is an important
determinant of job mobility (Gruber and Madrian 2004). Madrian (1994), for example, estimates that

The cutoff point is the level of l that makes workers indifferent as to whether they
work in the formal or informal sector. We denote this level of l by  which is

The equilibrium analysis is restricted to the cases where there are ﬁrms and
workers operating in both the formal and informal sectors. An equilibrium is then a
(wf; wi; lf ; li ; lf ; li ) vector such that there is market clearing in both the formal and
s s d d
informal labor markets, and where wages satisfy inequalities (10.3) and (10.4).
An equilibrium for this economy can be represented, graphically, as shown in
Fig. 3. The downward sloping curve represents the locus of wages where total labor

Note that the formal sector wage premium is not signed. This result holds when workers of informal
ﬁrms do not receive their payments (as assumed in the model). But it is robust to having the punishment
with a lower probability, as long as the probability is not zero.
21

Note that if condition (10.4 holds and HI C c, all workers would prefer to work in the formal sector.
Additionally, as is plausible, if the worker’s utility is such that it assigns positive utility to mandate social
beneﬁts only after a minimum level of income is achieved (wl), then condition (10.4) guarantees a cutoff
point regardless of the sign of HI - c.
