1 Introduction and background
Since the start of its roll-out in 2004, Mexico’s health insurance system Seguro
Popular has received considerable attention in the academic, as well as, policy
literatures. These can be subdivided into three broad topics: (i) the incidence of a
non-contributory health insurance on labor market decision, in particular informality; (ii) whether or not the program was successful in its stated aim of increasing
access to quality health services and reducing out of pocket expenses on health care,
and, lastly; (iii) the effect of the insurance on health outcomes.  However, as most
health outcomes, especially in adults, are slowly moving targets, it is doubtful
whether one would expect to ﬁnd any signiﬁcant effect of a recently established
program (Scott and Aguilera 2010). Focusing on shorter-term health outcomes,
some authors have recently found evidence that program afﬁliation results in lower
levels of cholesterol (Ruvalcaba and Parker 2010), lower blood pressure (Ruvalcaba
and Parker 2010; Bleich et al. 2007), and lower infant mortality (Pfutze 2014).
The present paper contributes to this last line of research. Similar to infant
mortality, any effect of improved health care access on the likelihood of a miscarriage
can be expected to manifest itself in the short-run. While there are some data-related
problems (a relatively rare outcome, combined with a noisy measurement of program
exposure) that affect statistical power, it is found that the program signiﬁcantly
reduced the risk of a miscarriage by around 0.04 % points for each percentage point
increase in coverage of the target population. It is also shown that this effect is not
changed much by potential selection on the outcome variable. The upshot is that
during the ﬁrst four and a half years of roll-out alone, Seguro Popular has prevented an
estimated 47,986 miscarriages. These are economically important positive welfare
effects that need to be included into every coherent assessment of the policy.
Regarding the literature in the other lines of research, following Santiago Levy’s
early critique that the program will undermine efforts to bring Mexico’s labor force
into the formal sector (Levy 2008), several studies have set out to determine
whether or not it changed the incentives to pursue formal vs. informal sector
employment (Aterido et al. 2011; Azuara and Marinescu 2013; Barros 2008; Bosch
´
´
and Campos-Vazquez 2014; Camacho et al. 2014; Campos-Vazquez and Knox
´
´
2013; Duval-Hernandez and Smith-Ramırez 2011). In most cases, they either ﬁnd
no effect or a statistically signiﬁcant, but fairly small shift toward informality. Other
studies focus on changes in the access and use of health services in response to the
program (Knox 2008; Sosa-Rubi et al. 2009), or the avoidance of catastrophic
health expenditures (Grogger et al. 2010; Gakidou et al. 2006; Knaul et al. 2006;
King et al. 2009). The principal ﬁndings are that the program has largely succeeded
on both counts.
The Seguro Popular health insurance program started its roll-out in January 2004,
after a pilot program in 2002/03. The roll-out occurred at the level of locality, with
localities that had a large proportion of its population uncovered being enrolled ﬁrst.
The insurance is de-facto non-contributory for all beneﬁciaries as it is free of charge
for households in the bottom two wealth quintiles as determined by a uniform
questionnaire, and for the immediate family of every child born after December 1,
2006. According to the Mexican health ministry, less than 1 % of the afﬁliated
households pay for coverage. Its declared aim is to provide health insurance to the
more than 50 % of Mexico’s population, mostly self-employed and/or in the
informal sector of the economy, that did not get coverage through any of the
employment linked programs or through the private market.1 It does not replace any
of the existing public health services, but adds a lowest tier of coverage to the
1

direct provider of health services. It certiﬁes health care providers and buys services
from a list of close to 300 covered interventions (plus a separate list of interventions
that would result in catastrophic health expenditures) at ﬁxed prices. A large number
of these interventions are related to pre-natal care.2 While in theory any provider
can be certiﬁed, the lion’s share is made up of clinics and hospitals run by the
federal and state level ministries of health (Lakin 2010).

2 Data and empirical strategy
Two different data sources are used. For one, the data on the Seguro Popular roll-out
have been provided directly by the Mexican Health Ministry. Starting in January
2004, it shows the number of afﬁliated individuals in each municipality on a
monthly basis. These monthly observations are available until late 2011, at which
point roll-out was considered complete (meaning that every person in the country
had the right to enroll). All other data come from the 2009 round of Mexico’s
National Survey on Demographic Dynamics (ENADID, by its Spanish acronym),
conducted by the country’s National Statistical Institute (INEGI). The survey was
conducted between May 18th and July 10th 2009, based on a stratiﬁed sampling
frame that was designed to produce representative results at the level of the state and
its rural and urban areas. It collected detailed data on each sampled household, and
administered an additional extensive questionnaire to all female members of
15–49 years of age. This questionnaire collected detailed data on all pregnancies a
woman had, whether or not they resulted in a miscarriage, and if so in which month
of gestation.3
The unit of observation is a pregnancy, and the binary outcome of interest is
whether or not it resulted in a miscarriage. The data available allow for the
calculation of the month of onset of each pregnancy observed. To avoid truncation
in the sample only pregnancies that started between January 2004 and July 2008 are
included. After that date, pregnancies may still not have concluded by the time of
the data were collected. A standard probit model is estimated with municipalityspeciﬁc and monthly (for each of the 55 months in the sample) ﬁxed effects,
implemented through the inclusion of a set of binary variables. The identifying
assumption is thus that once municipality-speciﬁc time invariant characteristics are
controlled for, the program roll-out can be treated as quasi-random. Put differently,
the roll-out did not respond to changes in the outcome of interest or unobserved
factors.
The treatment variable of interest is the relative level of roll-out in each month at
the municipal level, constructed as the proportion of the number of beneﬁciaries in
each month relative to the number in September 2011 (the last date available on a
monthly basis, and the month when roll-out was supposed to be concluded). Given

measure of whether or not a woman was eligible for coverage during the pregnancy,
but the best one that is available. The point estimates in the estimation must thus be
interpreted as the estimated effect of complete program roll-out. In the most
parsimonious speciﬁcation the only right-hand side variables included are the
treatment and the ﬁxed effects.
Several previous studies have used the staggered roll-out as the treatment
variable and shown that it is uncorrelated with municipal characteristics other than
size (more rural areas were treated earlier) and the proportion of the uncovered
population. The latter is to be expected as the program was ﬁrst implemented in
areas with little health coverage (Frenk et al. 2006). Most of the exogeneity tests
provided in the literature essentially show that program roll-out was not affected by
any other pre-analysis municipal characteristics. The upshot is that it should also be
unaffected by any changes in these characteristics. Since municipal characteristics
are usually only available every ﬁve or ten years, more direct panel-based tests with
´
more frequent data are often infeasible. Bosch and Campos-Vazquez (2014) and
Conti and Ginja (2014) use a binary treatment variable indicating whether or not a
municipality participates in Seguro Popular (deﬁned as having at least one
beneﬁciary). The ﬁrst paper tests for the exogeneity of treatment by regressing an
index capturing quarter and year in which a municipality entered the program on
municipality characteristics corresponding to the year 2000. The second paper runs
a similar exercise using the year of implementation as the dependent variable. To
my knowledge only paper that establishes exogeneity in a panel setting is Aterido
et al. (2011), who show that changes in labor market informality had no causal
effect on Seguro Popular enrollment in subsequent years. The treatment variable in
the present paper (relative implementation of Seguro Popular relative to 2011) has
already been used in Pfutze (2014). The treatment is shown to be exogenous by
regressing its average value over the 2004–2010 time period on a large number of
municipal characteristics, mostly taken from the 2005 census. Since state
governments were involved in the program roll-out, different states proceeded at
different speeds. However, once state level ﬁxed effects were controlled for all
variables, with exception of size and the initially uninsured population, turned out to
be statistically not signiﬁcant.
Results will also be presented for a speciﬁcation with additional control
variables. These are: a wealth index, the mother’s age at the onset of the pregnancy
and its squared value, the number of her previous pregnancies and miscarriages, and
a binary indicator for being indigenous. Given that the data were collected in early/
mid 2009, only control variables that are time invariant are included. The wealth
index is constructed based on a number of binary variables that capture dwelling
characteristics and ownership of durable goods using principal components analysis.
While the wealth index could be time variant, it can safely be assumed that it would
only be changing fairly slowly. More than just being an additional control variable,
the wealth index’s main purpose is to identify asset poor households, as these are
most likely to lack any other insurance coverage. Results will, therefore, be
presented ﬁrst for the full sample, followed by the subsample of households in the
After municipalities that have no variation in the outcome are excluded (which is
necessary due to the municipality level ﬁxed effects which would otherwise
perfectly predict the outcome), the sample consists of 27,445 pregnancies. It can be
seen that 11.4 % of pregnancies in the samples resulted in a miscarriage, implying
that the binary outcome variable denotes a relatively rare event. The average level
of program roll-out is 25.9 %, for a few (small) municipalities this number is larger
than one in some months due to an overall decline in their total population. The
average age at the onset of a pregnancy is around 25 years of age, and 5.4 % of
women are indigenous.
Figure 1 gives a visual impression of the two main variables, the roll-out of
Seguro Popular and the incidence of miscarriages. The former is presented by a
solid line, while the latter is shown as a dashed line. The Seguro Popular roll-out is
shown as the unweighted average across all municipalities in Mexico (i.e., not just
the subset included in the 2009 ENADID). It had a relatively steady increase with
the exception of two important spikes in late 2005 and 2006. The ﬁrst one, which is
also followed by no signiﬁcant further increase over most of 2006, is probably
explained by the fact that 2006 was a presidential election year. Mexican law
prohibits the advertising of social programs during electoral campaigns (Blindaje
Electoral). For that reason, the Health Ministry may well have decided to implement
most of the planned expansion for 2006 in December 2005, before the start of the
electoral season. The second spike corresponds to the implementation of the Seguro
´
´
Medico para una Nueva Generacion (SMNG) in December 2006. The SMNG
expanded eligibility to Seguro Popular at no cost to any child born after December
1, 2006, and its immediate family. The incidence of miscarriages is shown
according to the month a pregnancy started (not the month the miscarriage
occurred). The data show a high degree of seasonality without any clear tendency
over time. Given the high degree of variation, one would not expect to clearly see
the effect of the program. There seems to be a slight increase in the second half of
the time under study. This may just be a secular time effect, but one has also to keep
in mind that the data used constitute a random sample of women, who were all
interviewed in 2009, not of births. For one, memory bias will play a role if women

do not remember all miscarriages further back in time. Moreover, for more recent
births mothers are, on average, younger. For example, the proportion of teenage
mothers increases from 21.5 to 23.2 % and the average number of prior pregnancies
drops from 1.47 to 1.33. All these are associated with an increase in the risk of a
miscarriage. In the analysis below, all these factors will be controlled for by
monthly ﬁxed effects and the additional control variables for mother’s
characteristics.
As just mentioned, one problem with data on miscarriages is that in many cases
the event is unobserved by a woman. No reliable data on the overall incidence of
miscarriages exist even for rich countries. This implies that a successful pregnancy
(i.e., one resulting in a live birth) is more likely to be observed than one resulting in
a miscarriage. This induces an obvious problem of potential selection on the
outcome variable, which can be addressed using weighted exogenous sampling
maximum likelihood (WESML) estimator ﬁrst proposed by Manski and Lerman
(1977) for the choice-based sampling. This estimator has also been applied by
Pfutze (2014) to estimate the program’s impact on infant mortality. It consists of
Qði
applying to each observation n a weight deﬁned as wðin Þ ¼ Hðin Þ; where Qðin Þ
nÞ
denotes the population proportions of the outcome for observation n, and Hðin Þ
denotes the same proportion in the sample. Since the true population proportions are
unknown, the WESML will be run as a robustness check under two different
hypothesized true population proportions of miscarriages (15 and 20 %) to verify
whether results would change. It has to be pointed out that an undersampling of
miscarriages would in any case only result in a negative bias on the estimator, i.e.,
Table 2 shows estimation results. The ﬁrst two columns use the entire sample, and
the remaining four only observation in the lowest three wealth quintiles.
Speciﬁcations with and without controls are presented for the standard probit
models in columns (1)–(4). The last two columns show results for the WESML
estimator assuming that the true proportion of pregnancies that result in a
miscarriage in the population is 15 and 20 %, respectively. The tables show
parameter estimates and standard errors in parentheses. For ease of interpretation, at
the bottom the table also shows the estimated marginal effect at the mean for the
treatment variable.
As explained above, the treatment variable is an imperfect measure of whether or
not a woman as eligible for the program during the pregnancy. It has rather to be
interpreted as the probability of being eligible. The estimates are, therefore,
intention to treat effects. Moreover, since actual eligibility is not observed, the effect
can be expected to be statistically weaker. This is apparent in the table: While all the
control variables are highly statistically signiﬁcant, the treatment variable is so only
at the 10 % level. That said, the results on it are very consistent. As would be
expected, the effect becomes stronger if the estimation is reduced to the target

in main table with p values in parenthesis, the corresponding marginal effect at the mean for exposure to
insurance is shown below the number of observations. All speciﬁcations include year–month and
result within each sample, despite adding a number of highly signiﬁcant controls.
Neither does the WESML change the point estimates.
The implied marginal effects at the mean need to be interpreted carefully, since
the numbers presented refer to the counterfactual of complete program roll-out,
evaluated at the point of the largest marginal effect. Referring back to Table 1, for
the lowest three wealth quintiles, a one percentage point increase in roll-out, would
imply a reduction of 0.04 % point, or around 0.33 % relative to the sample mean.
Assuming different population proportions, the marginal effect continues to be
around 0.33 %. In terms of standard deviations, the reduction of a one standard
deviation increase in program coverage implies roughly a one percentage point (or
slightly less than 10 %) reduction in miscarriages.
These ﬁgures can be put into concrete numbers of pregnancies saved. Under the
assumption that the program had no effect on households in the top two wealth
quintiles, I will focus only on the results in column (4) of Table 2. Using sampling
weights, the data indicate that there has been a total of 630,331 miscarriages among
households in the bottom three wealth quintiles over the period of four years and
seven months under study. The estimation results imply that in the absence of the
program that number would have been 678.317. Put differently, over this time
period Seguro Popular saved an estimated 47,986 pregnancies. It has to be kept in
mind that the average roll-out was only 25.9 %. Under the counterfactual that the
program had been fully implemented over the entire period, it would have saved an
estimated 213.339 pregnancies, or around 46,500 per year. This means that it would
reduce the risk of a miscarriage by approximately 30 % for the targeted group (of
which not all will participate in the program). The latter results should, however, be
taken with a grain of salt as they assume a linear effect of program coverage on the
risk of miscarriage. Yet, if the most vulnerable population was treated ﬁrst, as it
seems to have been the case, one would expect decreasing marginal effects as the
program expanded further.
The point estimates on the control variables are of no direct interest, but merit
some brief discussion. The risk of a miscarriage follows an U-shaped pattern in
age (larger at low ages and high ages), and decreases in the number of previous
pregnancies. Having had more miscarriages prior to the current pregnancies
increases the risk of having another one, which probably captures woman-speciﬁc
risks. All these results would be expected. The two somewhat counterintuitive
ﬁndings are the positive effect in the wealth index and the negative one on the
dummy of being indigenous. The likely reason is that they may proxy for other
unobserved factors such as better medical knowledge (and general awareness
whether or not a miscarriage occurred) or cultural factors that affect whether the
respondent is willing to admit to prior miscarriages. The important insight from
the control variables is that their inclusion does not change the estimates on the
treatment, providing strong evidence for the exogenous nature of program
This study provided convincing evidence that access to the de-facto noncontributory health insurance program Seguro Popular in Mexico resulted in
decreased risk of miscarriages. It has been estimated that the program reduced the
number of miscarriages in the country by 47,986 during its ﬁrst four years and seven
months of operation and before having been fully implemented. This result is
important in two respects. First, it conﬁrms that access to basic health care has an
important and measurable effect on pregnancy risks with important direct welfare
effects. Second, it also shows that the program did have a measurable positive effect
on health outcomes that can be expected to change in the short-term. This is an
important general result for the future design of Seguro Popular, and also for policy
makers in other countries that try to extend basic heath care services to the entire
population. It also bodes well for possible effects on longer-term health outcomes,
which will be much more difﬁcult to establish and should be the focus of future
research.

Abstract This paper analyzes whether Mexico’s de-facto non-contributory health
insurance program Seguro Popular had an effect on the risk of miscarriage during
pregnancy. Using data on pregnancies over the 2004–08 period from the 2009 round
of the National Survey on Demographic Dynamics (ENADID), and employing the
staggered roll-out of the program as an identiﬁcation strategy, it is found that it
resulted in a signiﬁcant reduction in the risk of a miscarriage. For the target population, a one percentage point increase in eligibility is found to decrease miscarriages by .04 percentage point at the average.

2008; Martınez and Aguilera 2010; King et al. 2009; Knox 2008). However, as most
health outcomes, especially in adults, are slowly moving targets, it is doubtful
whether one would expect to ﬁnd any signiﬁcant effect of a recently established
program (Scott and Aguilera 2010). Focusing on shorter-term health outcomes,
some authors have recently found evidence that program afﬁliation results in lower
levels of cholesterol (Ruvalcaba and Parker 2010), lower blood pressure (Ruvalcaba
and Parker 2010; Bleich et al. 2007), and lower infant mortality (Pfutze 2014).
The present paper contributes to this last line of research. Similar to infant
mortality, any effect of improved health care access on the likelihood of a miscarriage
can be expected to manifest itself in the short-run. While there are some data-related
problems (a relatively rare outcome, combined with a noisy measurement of program
exposure) that affect statistical power, it is found that the program signiﬁcantly
reduced the risk of a miscarriage by around 0.04 % points for each percentage point
increase in coverage of the target population. It is also shown that this effect is not
changed much by potential selection on the outcome variable. The upshot is that
during the ﬁrst four and a half years of roll-out alone, Seguro Popular has prevented an
estimated 47,986 miscarriages. These are economically important positive welfare
effects that need to be included into every coherent assessment of the policy.
Regarding the literature in the other lines of research, following Santiago Levy’s
early critique that the program will undermine efforts to bring Mexico’s labor force
into the formal sector (Levy 2008), several studies have set out to determine
whether or not it changed the incentives to pursue formal vs. informal sector
employment (Aterido et al. 2011; Azuara and Marinescu 2013; Barros 2008; Bosch
´
´
and Campos-Vazquez 2014; Camacho et al. 2014; Campos-Vazquez and Knox
´
´
2013; Duval-Hernandez and Smith-Ramırez 2011). In most cases, they either ﬁnd
no effect or a statistically signiﬁcant, but fairly small shift toward informality. Other
studies focus on changes in the access and use of health services in response to the
program (Knox 2008; Sosa-Rubi et al. 2009), or the avoidance of catastrophic
health expenditures (Grogger et al. 2010; Gakidou et al. 2006; Knaul et al. 2006;
King et al. 2009). The principal ﬁndings are that the program has largely succeeded
on both counts.
The Seguro Popular health insurance program started its roll-out in January 2004,
after a pilot program in 2002/03. The roll-out occurred at the level of locality, with
localities that had a large proportion of its population uncovered being enrolled ﬁrst.
The insurance is de-facto non-contributory for all beneﬁciaries as it is free of charge
for households in the bottom two wealth quintiles as determined by a uniform
questionnaire, and for the immediate family of every child born after December 1,
2006. According to the Mexican health ministry, less than 1 % of the afﬁliated
households pay for coverage. Its declared aim is to provide health insurance to the
more than 50 % of Mexico’s population, mostly self-employed and/or in the
informal sector of the economy, that did not get coverage through any of the
employment linked programs or through the private market.1 It does not replace any
of the existing public health services, but adds a lowest tier of coverage to the
1

direct provider of health services. It certiﬁes health care providers and buys services
from a list of close to 300 covered interventions (plus a separate list of interventions
that would result in catastrophic health expenditures) at ﬁxed prices. A large number
of these interventions are related to pre-natal care.2 While in theory any provider
can be certiﬁed, the lion’s share is made up of clinics and hospitals run by the
federal and state level ministries of health (Lakin 2010).

2 Data and empirical strategy
Two different data sources are used. For one, the data on the Seguro Popular roll-out
have been provided directly by the Mexican Health Ministry. Starting in January
2004, it shows the number of afﬁliated individuals in each municipality on a
monthly basis. These monthly observations are available until late 2011, at which
point roll-out was considered complete (meaning that every person in the country
had the right to enroll). All other data come from the 2009 round of Mexico’s
National Survey on Demographic Dynamics (ENADID, by its Spanish acronym),
conducted by the country’s National Statistical Institute (INEGI). The survey was
conducted between May 18th and July 10th 2009, based on a stratiﬁed sampling
frame that was designed to produce representative results at the level of the state and
its rural and urban areas. It collected detailed data on each sampled household, and
administered an additional extensive questionnaire to all female members of
15–49 years of age. This questionnaire collected detailed data on all pregnancies a
woman had, whether or not they resulted in a miscarriage, and if so in which month
of gestation.3
The unit of observation is a pregnancy, and the binary outcome of interest is
whether or not it resulted in a miscarriage. The data available allow for the
calculation of the month of onset of each pregnancy observed. To avoid truncation
in the sample only pregnancies that started between January 2004 and July 2008 are
included. After that date, pregnancies may still not have concluded by the time of
the data were collected. A standard probit model is estimated with municipalityspeciﬁc and monthly (for each of the 55 months in the sample) ﬁxed effects,
implemented through the inclusion of a set of binary variables. The identifying
assumption is thus that once municipality-speciﬁc time invariant characteristics are
controlled for, the program roll-out can be treated as quasi-random. Put differently,
the roll-out did not respond to changes in the outcome of interest or unobserved
factors.
The treatment variable of interest is the relative level of roll-out in each month at
the municipal level, constructed as the proportion of the number of beneﬁciaries in
each month relative to the number in September 2011 (the last date available on a
monthly basis, and the month when roll-out was supposed to be concluded). Given

measure of whether or not a woman was eligible for coverage during the pregnancy,
but the best one that is available. The point estimates in the estimation must thus be
interpreted as the estimated effect of complete program roll-out. In the most
parsimonious speciﬁcation the only right-hand side variables included are the
treatment and the ﬁxed effects.
Several previous studies have used the staggered roll-out as the treatment
variable and shown that it is uncorrelated with municipal characteristics other than
size (more rural areas were treated earlier) and the proportion of the uncovered
population. The latter is to be expected as the program was ﬁrst implemented in
areas with little health coverage (Frenk et al. 2006). Most of the exogeneity tests
provided in the literature essentially show that program roll-out was not affected by
any other pre-analysis municipal characteristics. The upshot is that it should also be
unaffected by any changes in these characteristics. Since municipal characteristics
are usually only available every ﬁve or ten years, more direct panel-based tests with
´
more frequent data are often infeasible. Bosch and Campos-Vazquez (2014) and
Conti and Ginja (2014) use a binary treatment variable indicating whether or not a
municipality participates in Seguro Popular (deﬁned as having at least one
beneﬁciary). The ﬁrst paper tests for the exogeneity of treatment by regressing an
index capturing quarter and year in which a municipality entered the program on
municipality characteristics corresponding to the year 2000. The second paper runs
a similar exercise using the year of implementation as the dependent variable. To
my knowledge only paper that establishes exogeneity in a panel setting is Aterido
et al. (2011), who show that changes in labor market informality had no causal
effect on Seguro Popular enrollment in subsequent years. The treatment variable in
the present paper (relative implementation of Seguro Popular relative to 2011) has
already been used in Pfutze (2014). The treatment is shown to be exogenous by
regressing its average value over the 2004–2010 time period on a large number of
municipal characteristics, mostly taken from the 2005 census. Since state
governments were involved in the program roll-out, different states proceeded at
different speeds. However, once state level ﬁxed effects were controlled for all
variables, with exception of size and the initially uninsured population, turned out to
be statistically not signiﬁcant.
Results will also be presented for a speciﬁcation with additional control
variables. These are: a wealth index, the mother’s age at the onset of the pregnancy
and its squared value, the number of her previous pregnancies and miscarriages, and
a binary indicator for being indigenous. Given that the data were collected in early/
mid 2009, only control variables that are time invariant are included. The wealth
index is constructed based on a number of binary variables that capture dwelling
characteristics and ownership of durable goods using principal components analysis.
While the wealth index could be time variant, it can safely be assumed that it would
only be changing fairly slowly. More than just being an additional control variable,
the wealth index’s main purpose is to identify asset poor households, as these are
most likely to lack any other insurance coverage. Results will, therefore, be
presented ﬁrst for the full sample, followed by the subsample of households in the
After municipalities that have no variation in the outcome are excluded (which is
necessary due to the municipality level ﬁxed effects which would otherwise
perfectly predict the outcome), the sample consists of 27,445 pregnancies. It can be
seen that 11.4 % of pregnancies in the samples resulted in a miscarriage, implying
that the binary outcome variable denotes a relatively rare event. The average level
of program roll-out is 25.9 %, for a few (small) municipalities this number is larger
than one in some months due to an overall decline in their total population. The
average age at the onset of a pregnancy is around 25 years of age, and 5.4 % of
women are indigenous.
Figure 1 gives a visual impression of the two main variables, the roll-out of
Seguro Popular and the incidence of miscarriages. The former is presented by a
solid line, while the latter is shown as a dashed line. The Seguro Popular roll-out is
shown as the unweighted average across all municipalities in Mexico (i.e., not just
the subset included in the 2009 ENADID). It had a relatively steady increase with
the exception of two important spikes in late 2005 and 2006. The ﬁrst one, which is
also followed by no signiﬁcant further increase over most of 2006, is probably
explained by the fact that 2006 was a presidential election year. Mexican law
prohibits the advertising of social programs during electoral campaigns (Blindaje
Electoral). For that reason, the Health Ministry may well have decided to implement
most of the planned expansion for 2006 in December 2005, before the start of the
electoral season. The second spike corresponds to the implementation of the Seguro
´
´
Medico para una Nueva Generacion (SMNG) in December 2006. The SMNG
expanded eligibility to Seguro Popular at no cost to any child born after December
1, 2006, and its immediate family. The incidence of miscarriages is shown
according to the month a pregnancy started (not the month the miscarriage
occurred). The data show a high degree of seasonality without any clear tendency
over time. Given the high degree of variation, one would not expect to clearly see
the effect of the program. There seems to be a slight increase in the second half of
the time under study. This may just be a secular time effect, but one has also to keep
in mind that the data used constitute a random sample of women, who were all
interviewed in 2009, not of births. For one, memory bias will play a role if women

do not remember all miscarriages further back in time. Moreover, for more recent
births mothers are, on average, younger. For example, the proportion of teenage
mothers increases from 21.5 to 23.2 % and the average number of prior pregnancies
drops from 1.47 to 1.33. All these are associated with an increase in the risk of a
miscarriage. In the analysis below, all these factors will be controlled for by
monthly ﬁxed effects and the additional control variables for mother’s
characteristics.
As just mentioned, one problem with data on miscarriages is that in many cases
the event is unobserved by a woman. No reliable data on the overall incidence of
miscarriages exist even for rich countries. This implies that a successful pregnancy
(i.e., one resulting in a live birth) is more likely to be observed than one resulting in
a miscarriage. This induces an obvious problem of potential selection on the
outcome variable, which can be addressed using weighted exogenous sampling
maximum likelihood (WESML) estimator ﬁrst proposed by Manski and Lerman
(1977) for the choice-based sampling. This estimator has also been applied by
Pfutze (2014) to estimate the program’s impact on infant mortality. It consists of
Qði
applying to each observation n a weight deﬁned as wðin Þ ¼ Hðin Þ; where Qðin Þ
nÞ
denotes the population proportions of the outcome for observation n, and Hðin Þ
denotes the same proportion in the sample. Since the true population proportions are
unknown, the WESML will be run as a robustness check under two different
hypothesized true population proportions of miscarriages (15 and 20 %) to verify
whether results would change. It has to be pointed out that an undersampling of
miscarriages would in any case only result in a negative bias on the estimator, i.e.,
Table 2 shows estimation results. The ﬁrst two columns use the entire sample, and
the remaining four only observation in the lowest three wealth quintiles.
Speciﬁcations with and without controls are presented for the standard probit
models in columns (1)–(4). The last two columns show results for the WESML
estimator assuming that the true proportion of pregnancies that result in a
miscarriage in the population is 15 and 20 %, respectively. The tables show
parameter estimates and standard errors in parentheses. For ease of interpretation, at
the bottom the table also shows the estimated marginal effect at the mean for the
treatment variable.
As explained above, the treatment variable is an imperfect measure of whether or
not a woman as eligible for the program during the pregnancy. It has rather to be
interpreted as the probability of being eligible. The estimates are, therefore,
intention to treat effects. Moreover, since actual eligibility is not observed, the effect
can be expected to be statistically weaker. This is apparent in the table: While all the
control variables are highly statistically signiﬁcant, the treatment variable is so only
at the 10 % level. That said, the results on it are very consistent. As would be
expected, the effect becomes stronger if the estimation is reduced to the target

***, **, and * denote statistical signiﬁcance at the 1, 5, and 10 % levels, respectively. Results for probit
model with robust standard errors on binary variable indicating a miscarriage. Parameter estimates shown
in main table with p values in parenthesis, the corresponding marginal effect at the mean for exposure to
insurance is shown below the number of observations. All speciﬁcations include year–month and
result within each sample, despite adding a number of highly signiﬁcant controls.
Neither does the WESML change the point estimates.
The implied marginal effects at the mean need to be interpreted carefully, since
the numbers presented refer to the counterfactual of complete program roll-out,
evaluated at the point of the largest marginal effect. Referring back to Table 1, for
the lowest three wealth quintiles, a one percentage point increase in roll-out, would
imply a reduction of 0.04 % point, or around 0.33 % relative to the sample mean.
Assuming different population proportions, the marginal effect continues to be
around 0.33 %. In terms of standard deviations, the reduction of a one standard
deviation increase in program coverage implies roughly a one percentage point (or
slightly less than 10 %) reduction in miscarriages.
These ﬁgures can be put into concrete numbers of pregnancies saved. Under the
assumption that the program had no effect on households in the top two wealth
quintiles, I will focus only on the results in column (4) of Table 2. Using sampling
weights, the data indicate that there has been a total of 630,331 miscarriages among
households in the bottom three wealth quintiles over the period of four years and
seven months under study. The estimation results imply that in the absence of the
program that number would have been 678.317. Put differently, over this time
period Seguro Popular saved an estimated 47,986 pregnancies. It has to be kept in
mind that the average roll-out was only 25.9 %. Under the counterfactual that the
program had been fully implemented over the entire period, it would have saved an
estimated 213.339 pregnancies, or around 46,500 per year. This means that it would
reduce the risk of a miscarriage by approximately 30 % for the targeted group (of
which not all will participate in the program). The latter results should, however, be
taken with a grain of salt as they assume a linear effect of program coverage on the
risk of miscarriage. Yet, if the most vulnerable population was treated ﬁrst, as it
seems to have been the case, one would expect decreasing marginal effects as the
program expanded further.
The point estimates on the control variables are of no direct interest, but merit
some brief discussion. The risk of a miscarriage follows an U-shaped pattern in
age (larger at low ages and high ages), and decreases in the number of previous
pregnancies. Having had more miscarriages prior to the current pregnancies
increases the risk of having another one, which probably captures woman-speciﬁc
risks. All these results would be expected. The two somewhat counterintuitive
ﬁndings are the positive effect in the wealth index and the negative one on the
dummy of being indigenous. The likely reason is that they may proxy for other
unobserved factors such as better medical knowledge (and general awareness
whether or not a miscarriage occurred) or cultural factors that affect whether the
respondent is willing to admit to prior miscarriages. The important insight from
the control variables is that their inclusion does not change the estimates on the
treatment, providing strong evidence for the exogenous nature of program
This study provided convincing evidence that access to the de-facto noncontributory health insurance program Seguro Popular in Mexico resulted in
decreased risk of miscarriages. It has been estimated that the program reduced the
number of miscarriages in the country by 47,986 during its ﬁrst four years and seven
months of operation and before having been fully implemented. This result is
important in two respects. First, it conﬁrms that access to basic health care has an
important and measurable effect on pregnancy risks with important direct welfare
effects. Second, it also shows that the program did have a measurable positive effect
on health outcomes that can be expected to change in the short-term. This is an
important general result for the future design of Seguro Popular, and also for policy
makers in other countries that try to extend basic heath care services to the entire
population. It also bodes well for possible effects on longer-term health outcomes,
which will be much more difﬁcult to establish and should be the focus of future
research.
