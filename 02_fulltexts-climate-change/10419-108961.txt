1 Introduction
Education is a main ingredient for a successful life in modern societies. However, in
many countries the opportunities to get well educated strongly depend on the family
background, particularly in Latin America. As a result, we observe very low
intergenerational mobility. Understanding the mechanisms generating this intergenerational persistence in education is essential to target policy measures
adequately.


In this paper, I try to shed some light on this mechanism by applying a
simultaneous equations model to data from Mexico. The main goal of the study was
to estimate the relative importance of different transmission channels and their
interactions.
The three main mechanisms put forward in recent theoretical and empirical
contributions can be broadly described as being the biological, the economic and the
direct education-to-education channel.
The biological channel refers to the genetic transmission of ability, often
measured by the IQ, which explains a part of the relationship (Anger and Heineck
¨
2010; van Leeuwen et al. 2008; Bjorklund et al. 2010; Black et al. 2009).
Poor families facing credit constraints are an example for the economic channel,
because they cannot borrow against the expected future earnings of their offspring,
which generates a link between the socioeconomic situation of the parents and the
schooling of their children (see for instance Black and Devereux 2010; Attanasio
and Kaufmann 2009; Stinebrickner and Stinebrickner 2007; Carneiro and Heckman
2002; Alfonso 2009).
Finally, a higher return to education for children with highly educated parents is
an argument for the direct education-to-education channel (Black and Devereux
2010). It might also include preferences for education, non-cognitive skills,
aspirations and many other factors.
The empirical literature focuses on estimating the causal effect of parental
education on children’s education. Holmlund et al. (2011) revise this literature and
propose a comparison of different methods applied to the same dataset from
Sweden. They conclude that the estimates differ substantially across identiﬁcation
strategies and that no method is perfect. They ﬁnd relatively modest causal effects
of parental education and point to the importance of analyzing in more detail other
mechanisms explaining the intergenerational transmission of education. They
hypothesize about the possibility of an indirect effect of education through better
socioeconomic environment that can be offered to children. This conclusion on the
need of better understanding the mechanisms is shared by recent literature surveys
¨
¨
such as Black and Devereux (2010), Bjorklund and Jantti (2009) and Piketty (2000)
who coherently argue that more empirical research must be undertaken to
understand the mechanisms behind educational mobility and social mobility in
general. Black and Devereux (2010, p. 69) conclude that ‘‘[...] there is still much
work to do to pin down which family background factors are most important’’ and
¨
¨
Bjorklund and Jantti (2009, p. 516) argue that ‘‘a major challenge for future
research is to ﬁnd out what in the family other than income is important for the
future of children’’.
This study tries to contribute in the proposed direction by moving from the
estimation of one single causal effect to the estimation of a larger system of effects,
incorporating simultaneously the three channels previously outlined. This focus on
different mechanisms at the same time aims at getting a better understanding of the
larger picture—the whole process of intergenerational transmission of education. In
this respect, this approach should be seen as a complement to the single causal effect

The choice of Mexican data is primarily motivated by the importance of high
intergenerational correlations in education in Latin America. Hertz et al. (2007)
compare educational mobility of 42 countries including 7 Latin American ones.
These seven countries take the ﬁrst seven places ranked according to their
intergenerational education correlation. The country with the highest correlation is
Peru (0.66), followed by Ecuador, Panama and Chile.
Within Latin American Countries, Mexico displays relatively high intergenerational persistence in education. Dahan and Gaviria (2001) compare 16 Latin
American countries using data from the late 1990s and ﬁnd that Mexico has the
second lowest intergenerational mobility level behind El Salvador. de Hoyos et al.
(2010) use recent data on social mobility in Mexico. They report correlations
between the education in years of parents and children, ﬁnding the highest
correlation of about 0.6 for the children cohorts born between 1942 and 1951,
followed by a reduction of the correlation to about 0.5 for the cohort 1962–1971 and
ﬁnally a new increase of the correlation to 0.55 for the youngest cohort, composed
of children born between 1972 and 1981. According to the same authors, this recent
increase is even higher when using different data sources. The same pattern of
increasing educational mobility prior to the economic crisis in the 1980s and a
subsequent decrease was found by Binder and Woodruff (2002), who use different
cohorts to estimate the intergenerational link.
Hence, the Mexican case is not only interesting on its own but might be
representative for other Latin American Countries. Moreover, another advantage of
Mexico is the high-quality data available. The suitability of the survey for this study
is underlined by the availability of cognitive ability scores. Nevertheless, the
analysis faces a series of empirical challenges in the form of trade-offs. This study
tries to ﬁnd a balance between a more complete model with very high data
requirements and a simpler model in which less data are lost due to unavailable
information.
The main result is that even when controlling for parental education and ability,
the economic situation of the family has the largest direct effect on the schooling
outcome of children. This important source of inequality of opportunity could be
reduced by policy interventions targeting the link between economic requirements
and schooling. Moreover, the estimation shows that there are important interactions
between the channels, suggesting that the exclusion of some channels might
seriously bias estimates.
In Sect. 2 I will review the literature on the mechanisms of educational mobility
motivating my empirical models I present in Sect. 3. In Sect. 4 I describe the data
used and especially the needed transformations in detail and present some
descriptive evidence. In Sect. 5 I present the main results, which are complemented
by some ﬁgures in ‘‘Appendix B’’. Finally, Sect. 6 concludes the paper.

2 Theory and empirical evidence on educational mobility
Intergenerational mobility in education is a complex phenomenon that does not rely

(Chevalier 2004). The ﬁrst channel is the biological transmission of ability, the
second refers to the dependence of schooling outcome on the economic situation of
the parents and the third deals with direct education-to-education effects. In this
section, I present some theoretical and empirical contributions to the understanding
of these channels.
2.1 Ability transmission through genes: the biological channel
The direct transmission of abilities, which is not limited to simple IQ transmission,
represents a biological explanation of the phenomenon. For instance, Becker and
Tomes (1979) use the term endowments acquired from parents to describe this
direct transmission. They provide a theory of intergenerational transmission based
on rational choices through a human capital theory approach, where the ability level
of the offspring is a key determinant of the decision. Their model was consequently
extended by Loury (1981) and Solon (2004) and serves as a benchmark in many
analyses.
Empirically, much work has been done to determine the importance of this
channel. In a meta-analysis of 212 IQ studies, Devlin et al. (1997) quantify the
genetic transmission and ﬁnd the broad-sense heritability of IQ to be 48 %.
Social scientists put more emphasis on quantifying the overall IQ correlations
between parents and children, which might also include environmental effects in
addition to the pure heritability measured by Devlin et al. (1997). For instance,
Anger and Heineck (2010) use German panel-data with two ultra-short IQ-tests to
estimate the parent-offspring relation. They ﬁnd that a 1-point increase in parents’
score results in a 0.45-point increase in the coding speed (inherent ability) and 0.50point increase in word ﬂuency scores. The estimated coefﬁcients remain stable at
¨
the inclusion and exclusion of control variables. Bjorklund et al. (2010) use Swedish
data from military IQ tests and ofﬁcial registers. They estimate intergenerational
and sibling IQ correlations. The estimated values are all highly signiﬁcant and attain
values of 0.346 for father-son, 0.510 for siblings and 0.65 for twins. According to
the authors, their estimations represent rather a lower bound of the true values.
Black et al. (2009) ﬁnd a similar father-son IQ-correlation (0.38) in a comparable
study with Norwegian data.
van Leeuwen et al. (2008) go even further in the analysis of IQ-transmission by
dividing it further up. No evidence for cultural transmission of the IQ was found and
no indication that intelligent parents provide children with intelligence promoting
circumstances. Individual differences in intelligence were found to be largely
accounted for by genetic differences. Moreover, they ﬁnd a spousal IQ-correlation
of about 0.33 suggesting a relatively high degree of assortative mating.
2.2 Credit constraints and the economic situation: the economic channel
According to the logic of the economic channel the intergenerational correlation in
education is the fruit of an underinvestment in education by poor families. This idea

the human capital of their offspring impossible can be found, for example, in
Banerjee and Newman (1994) and Loury (1981).
Empirical research was not able to conclude on the exact importance of credit
constraints and the economic environment in general. While it seems that the impact
of credit constraints is relatively modest in richer countries, some evidence was
found that in developing countries the effect is larger.
Stinebrickner and Stinebrickner (2007) analyze the situation at a college in the
US using panel data of students. They ﬁnd that a group of students is credit
constrained in consumption during their stay at the college, but that many of them
are not willing to borrow.
Carneiro and Heckman (2002) critically revise the literature on the question of
credit constraints. They compute that using modern US data, only about 8 % of
students really face short-term credit constraints. They argue that long-term effects,
such as the family environment during the whole schooling period of children, play
a much bigger role. Winter (2007) elaborates a computable general equilibrium
model to evaluate the role of credit constraints in the decision whether to go to
college. The model is calibrated for the US economy and predicts observed patterns
quite well. The ﬁndings contrast the results of few credit constrained students found
by other studies and argue that econometric estimates such as in Carneiro and
Heckman (2002) are downward-biased. In line with the results of other studies is the
observation that the share of people ﬁnancially constrained has increased
(dramatically) over the past decades.
Alfonso (2009) presents a study of 4 Latin American countries (Mexico, Chile,
Colombia and Peru). She shows that the effect of credit constraints disappears in
regression analysis when controlling for long run family variables (parental
education, family assets, etc.). However, the relatively small effect of credit
constraints increases from the oldest to the newest datasets used in the study.
Attanasio and Kaufmann (2009) use Mexican data to analyze the relationship
between post-secondary school decisions and subjective expectations. Among other
ﬁndings on the role of expectations, they show that credit constraints represent an
important issue for poor Mexicans, in contrast to some literature coming from
higher developed countries, where these effects do not seem to be as present.
To sum up, the literature ﬁnds evidence for the existence of the economic
channel in producing high intergenerational correlations in education. It remains
somewhat unclear if short-run credit constraints or the long-run economic situation
are more important determinants. It seems, however, that in developing countries,
both contribute to the low educational mobility.
2.3 Education to education transmission
Finally, the third channel considered is the direct effect of parental education on the
schooling attainment of the children. This channel is generally known as the nurture
effect, capturing the direct causal effect of parental education (Holmlund et al.
2011; Chevalier 2004). Dickson et al. (2013) show that this direct causal effect starts
at very early ages and remains visible years later when comparing students’

causal effect can be found in the literature. One possible explanation is that highly
educated parents tend to encourage their children more to achieve high levels of
education (Merton 1953; Boudon 1973, 1974; Sewel and Shah 1968). For instance,
Steinberg et al. (1992) show that parental encouragement and parental school
involvement have important effects on the school performance of children. Besides
this active encouragement and involvement of parents, it can also be argued that the
child’s aspirations increase when parents have more education (Sewel and Shah
1968; Ermisch et al. 2006). Ermisch et al. (2006) argue that parental education can
alter the productivity of parents’ time investments in children. It could also be
argued that expected returns to education depend on parental education. Jensen
(2010) shows that students with higher educated parents tend to perceive higher
returns to education. Hence, this third channel is motivated by a series of arguments
and most likely composed of different sub-channels. The distinction of these
different sub-channels is beyond the scope of this paper. In this paper I consider a
compound channel linking high parental education to high offspring’s schooling.

3 Model
3.1 Conceptual model of educational mobility
Following the literature outlined in the previous section, we can easily illustrate the
three transmission channels. Figure 1 displays the system of transmission in
education suggested by the literature.

Fig. 1 Simpliﬁed conceptual system. The ﬁgure displays the conceptual framework of the analysis
presented in this study. Arrows refer to direct causal effects. Only channels that are included in the

First, there is a direct link between abilities of parents and children, presented
with the dotted line. The ability of the parents inﬂuences the ability of children,
which in turn increases their propensity for education. The economic channel is
represented by gray arrows using the compound term economic situation, which
includes short-term credit constraints and long-run effects of assets. Finally, the
third channel illustrated with solid black arrows represents the direct education-toeducation transmission, which is based on many different hypotheses as explained
above.
A channel that I do not consider in this study is the health channel. The health
status of the child is likely to be inﬂuenced by the family background on the one
hand (Bradley and Corwyn 2002; Rosa Dias 2009; Delajara and Wendelspiess
´
´
Chavez Juarez 2013), while it might also have important effects for education on the
other hand (Case et al. 2005; Doyle et al. 2009). There are two reasons for not
including this channel, both related to the data. First, there is a problem of timing in
the health data. While the literature emphasizes on the importance of the prenatal
period and early childhood in the health dimension (Heckman 2006; Doyle et al.
´
´
2009; Delajara and Wendelspiess Chavez Juarez 2013), in the data I can at most
observe the current health status of the child. Unfortunately there is no retrospective
information on the child’s health conditions at birth available. Second, as I will
highlight in Sect. 4 the inclusion of additional variables would seriously reduce the
sample and increase the risk of sample selection problems. In the ‘‘Appendix E’’ I
present some regressions where I include variables for health and personality traits
to illustrate the problems just described.
Different strategies are possible to analyze such a framework empirically. One
way is to focus on one particular link. For instance, Holmlund et al. (2011) present
different methods to estimate the causal relationship between the education of
parents and children. In this paper I use two different strategies. First, I focus on a
single equation approach where I aim at estimating all the determinants of the
child’s education outcome in one regression. In a second step, I move to a
simultaneous equations model where I estimate several equations to describe the
whole system outlined in Fig. 1. I will now explain the two approaches along with
their intuition, advantages and challenges.
3.2 The single regression approach
The main goal of the empirical application is to estimate the intergenerational links
determining the educational outcome of the child. Therefore, a ﬁrst empirical
approach consists in regressing the educational outcome on the possible intergenerational determinants while controlling for some contemporaneous effects. The
intergenerational determinants are parental education and the economic situation of
the family. Moreover, I also control for parental age, whether the parents have an
indigenous background and some variables capturing the family structure1. The
most important contemporaneous effect I control for is the cognitive ability of the
1

These variables include the number of children (up to 12 years old) and teenagers (12–18 years old) in

child. Additionally, I also control for contemporaneous effects such as child labor,
government program beneﬁts, state ﬁxed effects and indicators for girls and rural
areas.
Besides its appealing simplicity, the single regression approach has the advantage
that we do not have to impose a lot of structure in the model. Therefore, only the
standard assumptions for ordinary least squared must be fulﬁlled. One concern that
could arise is that some variables do not satisfy these conditions and are likely to be
correlated with the error term. The most likely reason for this to happen in our
context is an omitted variable bias. A ﬁrst critical variable is the ability level of the
child, which might also capture for instance motivation or the ability to perform
well in a situation of examination. Both potentially omitted variables are also likely
to inﬂuence the schooling outcome. To a large extent, these concerns are reduced by
the type of cognitive ability measure I am using in this study. The ability measure is
based on a short version of the Raven’s progressive matrices test, which is one of
´
the most culture-free and education independent IQ-tests (Desert et al. 2009). I
discuss this in more detail when describing the data in Sect. 4. A second variable
that might suffer an omitted variable bias is parental education, as parental
education might also be inﬂuenced by preferences and taste for education. If these
preferences and tastes are also transmitted to the next generation, we are likely to
have an endogeneity problem as well.
In order to account for these potential endogeneity issues I also perform
instrumental variable regressions for the single regression approach. Father’s and
mother’s cognitive ability is used to instrument both the parental education and the
child’s ability level. The cognitive ability of the parents should be a strong predictor
of both parental education2 and the cognitive ability of the child. At the same time,
the cognitive ability of the parents should not have a direct impact on the schooling
outcome of the child. For the case of parental education, I additionally use
information on the place of living of the parents when they were 12 years old. A
dummy capturing whether they lived in a town or not is used.3 The idea is that
parents living in cities had substantially more access to education than parents living
in rural areas. At the same time, the place of living of the parents when they were 12
years old should not directly affect the education outcome of their children today. In
the results section, I will present in detail the different tests for the instruments,
which clearly indicate that the instruments are valid and strong.
Let me ﬁrst introduce the second estimation approach, where I simultaneously
estimate the whole system presented in Fig. 1.

2

The use of parental cognitive ability to instrument parental education could be problematic if the ability
measure was inﬂuenced by the education. However, as mentioned in the data section, the used RPM test is
less education dependent than other measures of cognitive ability. Therefore, I argue that the assumption
of no reversed causality might be reasonable. Additionally, I discuss the empirical tests related to the
validity of the instruments.

3

The original variable included more categories to describe the situation outside towns. However, they
were relatively unclear and did not provide additional explanatory power. For this reason, I regrouped all

3.3 The simultaneous regression approach
In addition to the single regression approach previously presented, I also use a
simultaneous equations model approach to estimate not only the intergenerational
links, but also the different transmission channels in more detail. There are two
main advantages of focusing on the whole system. First, it allows us to estimate the
relative importance of the three channels put forward by the literature. This is
important because analyzing a speciﬁc channel and ﬁnding signiﬁcant effects does
not tell us much about the relative importance of the analyzed channel with respect
to other possible channels. A channel might show very signiﬁcant effects and at the
same time be relatively irrelevant for the whole system. Second, estimating a system
allows us to consider interactions between channels and as a consequence direct and
indirect effects. For instance, parents’ ability is likely to have both of them. The
direct link effect of parental ability refers to the biological channel introduced
earlier. The indirect effect goes through parental education and the economic
situation. More able parents are likely to have more education and a better
socioeconomic status. Behrman and Rosenzweig (2002) show that intergenerational
correlations between mother’s and children’s education might be biased when such
system aspects are not considered. For instance, they mention that such estimates
are upward biased, when not controlling for the ability channel or for assortative
mating.
On the other hand, the estimation of the model as a whole might also has some
disadvantages. We might overestimate the effect of the three analyzed channels due
to relevant but unobserved channels. Such unobserved channels might include the
health channel discussed earlier or some soft skills like personality traits and noncognitive abilities. I will discuss this issue in the description of the econometric
model and the empirical analysis with more detail. First, I will formally introduce
the econometric model, which can be written as follows:

of the family or the child. An alternative way of presenting the model is the path
diagram in Fig. 2.
The white ﬁlled boxes refer to exogenous variables, the gray boxes represent
endogenous variables and the arrows describe direct effects. Note that for the sake
of readability of the graph, I present both parents and both economic indicators
together. Even though the graphical representation is more illustrative, I will now
discuss the model mainly based on the equations presented above.
Equation (1) describes the genetic transmission of cognitive ability, where the
main explanatory factors of the child’s ability are the parental cognitive ability
scores.4 Additionally to the parental ability scores, I add some control variables such
as the gender of the child, a dummy for ﬁrst-born children and two dummies for
children with a small (\20 years) and large ( [ 40 years) age difference to their
parents. Parental education is excluded from this regression because we can assume
that there is no direct effect on the cognitive ability score of the child. This
assumption is based on the nature of the used cognitive ability test, which is
´
education- and culture-independent (Desert et al. 2009). For the same reason, no
feedback effect from education to ability is included. The economic situation is not
included as an explanatory variable because the transmission through genes took

do not include indicator variables for non-cognitive abilities and estimate a latent factor. This choice

place at birth, while the economic situation indicators are contemporaneous values
and have, therefore, no direct effect.
Equations (2) and (3) are simpliﬁed education production functions for the father
and the mother, respectively. The idea is to link parental ability to their schooling
outcome and to control for cohort- and ethnicity-based differences in the
educational level of parents. I also include the instrument of the single regression
approach capturing the place of living of the parents when they were 12 years old.
The idea is that parents that grew up in towns had substantially better access to
schooling than those living in the countryside. Both indicators of the economic
situation are excluded from this regression because of the timing of these variables.
The economic situation today does not directly explain the educational achievement
of the parents when they were in the schooling age.
Equations (4) and (5) estimate the effect of parental education and ability on the
two indicators of the economic situation. The economic situation is split into
consumption and a wealth index. This index was obtained by taking the ﬁrst
component of a principal component analysis on several indicators of durable good
holdings and housing conditions.5 Taking this index instead of the full set of
indicator variables allows me to reduce the dimensionality and to use the wealth
index as an indicator for the long-run economic situation. The use of both, the
wealth index and the current consumption level, is motivated by the ﬁndings in the
literature, saying that the (long-run) economic environment is more important than
current consumption. In addition to the exogenous variables, the economic situation
is also inﬂuenced by parental education.
Finally, Eq. (6) is the main equation corresponding to the single equation
approach outlined before. The explanatory variables of interest are parental
education, the economic situation indicators and the ability score of the child. I also
control for some contemporaneous effects by including control variables capturing
the family structure, the place of living, the government program beneﬁts, the
working conditions of the child and the gender of the child.
To sum up, the coefﬁcients of main interest are the b’s and to a lesser extent the
w’s. The b’s estimate the direct impact of family background variables and the
child’s ability on educational attainment. The w’s permit us to estimate the
relationship between parental and child’s ability, i.e. estimating the biological
transmission. Through the w’s and b1 the total effect of the biological transmission
on the educational outcome can be estimated. This setting allows us to estimate the
relative importance of the different channels in the educational transmission. The
model is estimated using the maximum likelihood method under normality
´
assumptions (Muthen 2004). In contrast to the instrumental variables techniques
used in the single equation approach, the identiﬁcation of the simultaneous equation
model is somewhat more complicated to show. The model presented in this paper is
easily identiﬁed due to its quasi-recursive structure. I use the term quasi-recursive
because I do not assume independence of the error terms for contemporaneous
equations. As a consequence, I use more restrictive identifying conditions to show

5


that all parameters in all equations are identiﬁed. A detailed discussion of the
identiﬁcation conditions along with the proofs can be found in the ‘‘Appendix D’’.

4 Data
4.1 Data description
The analysis of this paper requires very complete data at the micro level for both
children and parents. The Mexican Family Life Survey (MXFLS)6 is a very rich and
award-winning panel data project from Mexico and ﬁts these requirements quite
well. I use information from the ﬁrst two waves (2002 and 2005), focusing on the
latter wave. The panel structure was mainly used to reduce the amount of
measurement errors, for instance, by identifying and correcting impossible values
for time invariant variables.7 To the extent of my knowledge, this is the best data
source from a Latin American Country for this kind of analysis, particularly because
it includes short cognitive ability tests. Nevertheless, the data are not perfect and
before starting with the analysis I discuss some trade-offs faced and the resulting
decisions taken.
4.1.1 Choosing the age range of the sample and the schooling outcome variable
A ﬁrst challenge is to choose correctly the age range of the primary units of analysis.
In order to estimate properly the correlation of years in education one would have to
limit the analysis to people having ﬁnished their education, i.e. mostly people over
25, implying two major problems.
First, older individuals are probably no longer living with their parents. However,
as I do not have administrative data, I can only establish the link between children
and parents when they are living in the same household. Those still living with their
parents years after completing school are most likely not representative for the
whole population.
The second problem is that the schooling period of older people having ﬁnished
education lies potentially far in the past. Therefore, the economic situation for that
time would be hard to proxy and the mechanisms I would analyze would be those
prevailing some years ago, which is not necessarily very policy relevant.
At the lower bound of the age range we cannot include too young children, as
they are only about to start their educational path. Therefore, the information on
years of schooling is likely to be much less related to their ﬁnal schooling outcome
as compared to slightly older children.
For these reasons, I focus on children and young adults from 12 to 25 years and
use a constructed education index instead of years of schooling. The idea behind this

the main regressions

index is very simple: instead of measuring the ﬁnal outcome, I consider the delay in
schooling that people have with respect to their peers. The index is computed by
dividing an individual’s years of schooling by the average years of schooling of her
age cohort. A value of 1 corresponds to a child that is just on time compared to its
peers; a value below 1 suggests a delay.
Figure 3 displays some key statistics by age on the left side and the cumulative
density function of the education index on the right side. The cumulative
distribution function is depicted by age groups corresponding to students in the
age of secondary and high school education (12–17 years) and tertiary education
(18–25 years), respectively.
On the left graph we can see that the dispersion of the index is relatively stable
for the ages corresponding to secondary and high school. For the ages
corresponding to tertiary education the dispersion increases, especially the 95th
percentile increases. This change is due to the fact that a substantial proportion of
individuals do not continue education beyond the high school level. Therefore, the
reference level remains at lower levels and those actually attending tertiary
education achieve higher levels of the education index. On the right-hand side
graph we can see that there is a considerable amount of variation in the index,
starting at values close to zero for those with no or very little education and going
up to almost 2. For the younger age group a stronger concentration around the
value of 1 can be observed. This is due to the fact that less variation in the years
of education is observed.8
The underlying assumption of this indicator is that a delay in schooling is
translated later on in fewer years of schooling. In ‘‘Appendix A’’ I present some
empirical evidence of this relationship and provide some additional information on
the Mexican education system, along with some basic statistics such as enrollment
rates.

4.1.2 Variable selection and construction
A second data challenge is to include as much relevant information as possible by
minimizing the cost in terms of loss of observations due to missing values. My
strategy in the variable selection process was to give absolute priority to the three
main channels discussed earlier. At the same time, I tried to avoid unnecessary loss
of observations due to less relevant variables. To face this trade-off I started by
deﬁning a set of absolutely needed variables which cannot be excluded from the
analysis without seriously changing the model. For this type of variables, dropping
observations due to missing values is unavoidable. A second series of interesting but
not absolutely indispensable variables was selected trying to avoid variables that
would cause a large loss of observations. In this respect, some variables potentially
able to capture soft skills and personality traits were excluded, because too many
observations would have been lost.9
One of the main reasons to use the MXFLS data is the availability of cognitive
ability measures based on Raven’s progressive matrices (RPM). According to
´
Desert et al. (2009) RPM is a frequently used intelligence test with proven reliability
´
and validity in measuring cognitive aptitudes and reasoning. Desert et al. (2009)
further highlight that this IQ test is less education dependent than others, reducing
the risk of feedback effects from education.10 Different versions of the test were
applied to children (5–12 years) and adults (13–65 years). In order to have
comparable scores across age groups, the values were normalized to a distribution
with mean 100 and standard deviation 15 for each age. The choice to normalize to
the mean and standard deviation of the IQ is essentially for illustrative purpose, but
it does not imply that the cognitive ability scores can be seen as a complete measure
of IQ. Moreover, the normalization is not relevant for the results, because I report
only standardized coefﬁcients, which are by deﬁnition independent of previous
normalizations. Given the panel structure of the survey, two test scores per person
are available, allowing us to compute the average score of the person to reduce
measurement errors. Observations where the two scores had a difference of more
than 2 standard deviations were dropped from the analysis. For people with only one
valid test score this was taken to avoid losing too many observations.
Parental education in years was obtained by computing the average time spent in
school to achieve the reported education. Repeated years are, therefore, not
considered as schooling years, as one can argue that they do not provide additional
human capital. Note that the question on the achieved education level is asked twice
in the survey. Once it is asked in the roster questionnaire and once in the individual
questionnaires. I primarily took the information from the individual data and
completed it by the roster data when the individual data was missing.
The family log-consumption per capita was obtained out of a series of
information on consumption and normalized to the consumption per equivalent
9

Experimental regressions were performed including such variables in order to see if their exclusion
alters the results. I discuss these brieﬂy in the ‘‘Appendix E’’.

10
More details on Raven’s progressive matrices and its implementation in the MXFLS can be found in

adult following the methodology proposed by Rojas (2007), who provides estimates
for Mexico based on the subjective well-being approach.11 The wealth index was
obtained by taking the ﬁrst component of a principal component analysis performed
on several household assets and indicators of the housing conditions. A list of the
included indicators and their relative importance for the wealth index and its
possible relation with parental age are reported in the ‘‘Appendix C’’. The remaining
variables included in the study were constructed in a straightforward way according
to the standards in the literature and are reported with a short description in Table 1.
4.1.3 Sample size and sample selection
Initially 11,273 children and young adults aged between 12 and 25 years were
present in the database. From these only 8,155 individuals lived with both parents in
the same household. This is a necessary condition for this study, since otherwise no
cognitive ability scores of the parents are available. Proxies for other variables such
as education of absent family members would be available, but the cognitive scores
are not. Missing values in parents’ and children’s characteristics introduced another
loss of observations, reducing the sample to 4,266 observations. The large loss of
observations is not surprising considering the data requirements of the study and the
fact that they are survey data from an emerging country. These data are obviously
not as good as administrative data from European countries that were used in some
other studies on the topic. It could be argued that the loss of observations introduces
sample selection biases. Being fully aware of this fact, I try to show that the sample
used in this study produces some very comparable results to ﬁndings in the literature
and that the analysis is quite robust to changes in the sample. I also estimate the
benchmark model with larger samples, where I relax some data requirements. For
instance, excluding the channel of the father allows me to take into account the
numerous single-mother households and merging the effects of the father and the
mother, allows me to include every single-parent household. These larger sample
regressions are reported in ‘‘Appendix B’’.
4.2 Descriptive statistics
Let us now have a closer look at the data. Table 1 presents some univariate
descriptive statistics of the sample I use in the econometric models. The different
variables are divided into blocks corresponding to their role in the econometric
model. The main dependent variable is the education index previously introduced.
The index was constructed using the largest sample possible and not only the
observations used in the econometric estimation. Therefore, the average value is
slightly higher than 1. The same logic applies to the ability measures, which were
estimated using all available information.

11
Using the ofﬁcial Mexican equivalence scales based on CONEVAL (2008) gives essentially the same
results where only the third digit after the comma changes by at most two units. I prefer to follow Rojas

Descriptive statistics based on the sample of 4,266 observations
* Normalization was made with the full sample to use a maximum of information. The mean can deviate

The average and the standard deviation of the fathers’ years of education are
slightly higher than for the mothers. The proportion of indigenous parents is around
15 % which corresponds to the national average. The age of parents is measured in
years and fathers are slightly older than mothers. About one-quarter of parents grew
up in a city. The sample is strongly balanced between girls and boys and also
between families living in rural and urban areas. The indicator of rural areas is based
on the ofﬁcial deﬁnition of rural zones in Mexico and the place of living at the time
of the survey. As people might have lived in a different place during their education,
I use additional information on migration to correct the variable accordingly.12 Two
variables (Work02 and Work05) capture whether the children were working in 2002
and 2005, respectively. The proportion grows from around 17 to 25 %, reﬂecting the
aging of the cohort. The indicators on the number of children and teenagers allow us
to control for the composition of the households. On average, there is one child
below 12 years and about 1.6 teenagers present in a household. The set of
dichotomous program variables captures the beneﬁciary status of families for
different government programs. The proportions of beneﬁciaries are generally very
low, with the exception of Oportunidades and Procampo where the proportion is
above 10 %.
More interestingly than the averages of the variables are the relationships among
them. I now present some simple linear correlations between important variables.
They should provide a good impression of the data and outline some potentially
interesting phenomena. On the other hand, they should give us an impression of
comparability of the data with data used in other studies. I hope to reduce some
concerns regarding the sample selection issues and the deﬁnition of some main
variables by showing that the descriptive statistics are surprisingly comparable to
other studies in the literature.
A ﬁrst issue that one might discuss regarding the data is the use of Raven’s
progressive matrices test as a measure of cognitive ability or even IQ. In the sample,
the correlation of the ability measure with the one of the father is 0.363. This value
¨
is very close to the 0.347 and 0.38 estimated by Bjorklund et al. (2010) and Black
et al. (2009), respectively, both using more detailed IQ measures. The same
correlation with respect to the mother was found to be 0.387, which is slightly
higher than the father–son correlation. Considering only the two oldest siblings in a
family gives a siblings IQ-correlation of 0.506, which is again relatively close to the
¨
values reported by Bjorklund et al. (2010) who ﬁnd estimates between 0.473 and
0.510. Interestingly, and giving a ﬁrst evidence for assortative mating, the spousal
IQ-correlation is 0.400. The spousal education-correlation based on the years of
schooling is 0.646, which is even higher and supports the idea of an important role
of non-random spousal selection.

12
Unfortunately, it is not possible to use exclusively the information on the place of living when people
where at the age of education, because the variable is measured differently. I correct the variable rural
only in cases where people reported that they lived in a city during education and living in rural areas at
the time of the survey. The large majority of the individuals (around 90 %) never changed the place of
living and, therefore, the information of the place of living at the time of the survey is accurate for the

The reported correlations refer to the correlation between the years of education of the father and mother,
respectively, and the constructed education index. All correlations are computed for the working sample
used in this study

Regarding the simple educational attainment correlation between parents and
children, a very interesting pattern can be found when splitting the sample into age
groups. Table 2 presents the correlation between the education index used in this
study to proxy the educational attainment of children and their parents’ years of
education.
The correlations are substantially higher for the older age group as compared to
the younger group.13 Several possible explanations for this can be found. First, the
intergenerational transmission is likely to be a cumulative process, thus the older the
children become, the larger is the relationship between parental education and the
educational outcome of their children. Second, it could also be due to the precision
of the education attainment indicator used in this study. The older the children are,
the more values the indicator can take and, therefore, the correlations might be
estimated with more precision.14
The correlations for the older age group are slightly below the correlation of 0.55
estimated by de Hoyos et al. (2010) for children born between 1972 and 1981 in
Mexico. The likely reason for the difference is that de Hoyos et al. (2010) use older
individual with ﬁnished education. Looking at the difference from the younger to
the older age group, it is very likely to end up with similar values as de Hoyos et al.
(2010) if we could include older individuals.
Finally, Table 3 gives a comparison between the used and the full sample for the
main variables of interest. We can see that the differences are not statistically
signiﬁcant for father’s education and both parental ability measures. For consumption the difference is only signiﬁcant at the 10 % level. For other variables we
observe statistically different means, which is not very surprising with that many
observations. However, by looking at the column ‘Diff/SD’ we can see that the
13
Note that when computing the same correlation for younger children (say 7–11 years), the values are
even lower.
14

This argument is particularly true when considering even younger children at the age of primary
school. A previous version of this study included them. The decision to take them out of the study is
mainly due to this argument saying that the precision of the education attainment indicator is not

The ‘full sample’ includes all individuals in the age range of the study with non-missing values. The
column ‘Diff/SD’ refers to the difference between the two samples divided by the standard deviation of
the full sample

difference in terms of standard deviation of the variable never exceeds 0.2; thus they
are probably not as problematic as the statistical tests might lead us to think.
Overall, the data are certainly not perfect and do not attain the standards of highquality administrative data from some European studies. Nevertheless, the working
sample does seem to represent the full sample relatively well and permits us to carry
out the analysis.

5 Results
In Sect. 3 I introduced the two approaches to estimate the intergenerational
transmission in education. I now present the result following the same structure.
First I present the single regression approach where I estimate simple OLS and IV
models and then I move to the discussion of the simultaneous equations model.
5.1 Single regression approach
Table 4 presents the main regression results of the single-equation approach. The

the robust estimator to account for heteroskedasticity. In the model IV-1 I
instrument both parental education and the ability level of the child. For the models
IV-2 and IV-3 I instrument child’s ability and parental education separately. For
presentational reasons, I do not report some control variables such as the age and the
indigenous background of the parents and the indicator for rural areas. These
variables are not signiﬁcant. Additionally, I do not report the coefﬁcients of the
government program beneﬁts and the state ﬁxed effects to reduce the size of the
table.
Let us ﬁrst discuss the main coefﬁcients of the OLS regression, which are all
presented with standardized coefﬁcients. The ability of the child has a strong and
highly signiﬁcant effect on the schooling outcome. The direct effect of parental
education is also highly signiﬁcant and positive. The effect of the mother is larger
than the one of the father, which is in accordance with the literature. Both indicators
for the economic situation of the family display positive and signiﬁcant effects.
Note that this estimation does not directly allow us to conclude about the biological
channel, as we do not estimate the link between parental ability and child’s ability.
In order to see whether these OLS estimates are reliable, I move now to the
discussion of the IV estimates. First, we can see in the models IV-1 and IV-2 that the
coefﬁcients of the child’s ability does not change a lot as compared to the OLS
estimates. By looking at the endogeneity test based on Baum et al. (2007), we can
actually see that the variable is not endogenous and, therefore, instrumenting it is
not required. However, this test is only valid under the assumption of valid
instruments. To test the validity, I use the Hansen J statistic, which indicates that the
instruments are valid.15 Hence, for the ability measure of the child we do not seem
to have an endogeneity problem.16 As mentioned earlier, this might be due to a large
extent to the nature of the cognitive ability test, which is much less related to
education and cultural aspects than other ability measures.
Let us now turn to parental education. In the models IV-1 and IV-3 I instrument
parental education. Contrary to the previous results, we ﬁnd strong differences in the
coefﬁcients between the OLS estimation and the IV estimates. The coefﬁcient for
the father increases sharply while the coefﬁcients for the mother becomes much
smaller and insigniﬁcant.17 This is surprising and contrary to the ﬁndings in the
literature where the maternal education seems to matter more. It is, therefore,
important to understand where this result comes from. According to the Hansen
J-statistic the instruments are valid and the weak instrument test does not point to a
problem of weak instruments. In order to better understand the results, let us have a
closer look to the ﬁrst stage regressions presented in Table 5.
The Angrist-Pischke F-statistic is very large and suggests that the instruments are
strong (Angrist and Pischke 2009). Thus, in terms of the standard test for IV15

The null hypothesis of the test is that the instruments are valid.

16

In the regression IV-2 we could reject the null hypothesis at the 10 % level. I, therefore, performed the
endogeneity test on child’s ability only in the model IV-1, where we have clearly valid instruments. The
test shows also that child’s ability is not endogenous.
17
However, the two coefﬁcients are not signiﬁcantly different from each other (p value of 0.344 and
0.320 for IV-1 and IV-3, respectively). Hence, they are not contradicting the results found in the OLS

regression, these estimates seem to be valid. However, there is another problem
stemming from the underlying nature of the analysis, which goes beyond the
standard challenges of IV. Note that both father’s and mother’s education are
correlated with the cognitive ability measure and the place of living of either
parents. This is a direct result of assortative mating. It is clear that these correlations

All regressions include also additional control variables such as mother’s and father’s age and indigenous
background, an indicator for rural areas (none of these is signiﬁcant). Additionally, state ﬁxed effects and
control variables of government aid programs are included but not reported. Robust standard errors are

are not causal. The consequence of this is that instrumented variables of the two
parents very strongly correlate. I computed the predicted education of the father and
the mother using the ﬁrst stage regression and ﬁnd a correlation of nearly 0.95,
while the actual parental education correlation is close to 0.65. Hence, in the main
regression, we have a strong problem of multicollinearity, which can explain why
the increase in the coefﬁcient related to the father is compensated by the coefﬁcient
related to the mother. This problem can also be highlighted with the additional
regressions IV-3b and IV-3c reported in Table 4. In these two regressions I excluded
one of the two parents and used only the instruments related to the parent included
in the regression. We can see that in both regressions the parameter of the parents is
highly signiﬁcant.
Overall, the single equation approach provided very coherent and expected
results. The education of the mother seems to matter slightly more than the
education of the father. The wealth index seems to matter more than the short-run
consumption and the cognitive ability of the child is also an important predictor of
the schooling outcome. Finally, the endogeneity tests performed on the IV estimates
did not allow us to conclude that we have a serious problem of endogeneity. I now
move to the simultaneous equations model which will allow us to learn more about
the different channels and their relative importance.
5.2 Simultaneous regression approach
Let me now turn to the results of the simultaneous equation model introduced in
Sect. 3.3. The possibility of estimating several channels simultaneously permits us
not only to avoid some biases due to omitted variables, but also to quantify these
biases by running regressions with some excluded variables on the same data. This
idea inﬂuenced the estimation strategy and made it straightforward to estimate some
simpliﬁed models alongside the complete model. This ﬁrst set of estimation results
is reported in Table 6. All models are estimated on exactly the same sample to avoid
confounding potential differences in the coefﬁcients due to changes in the model on
the one hand and due to changes in the sample on the other. Standardized

Model 1 is the complete model including ability, father’s and mother’s education
and the economic situation proxied by two variables. These main regressors were
accompanied by control variables such as gender, a rural area dummy, state ﬁxed
effects, social program dummies and child labor indicators which are not reported in
Table 6. The full estimation results of model 1, including the remaining equations of

Considering model 1, the estimation is quite precise and all coefﬁcients are
signiﬁcant at the 1 %-level. The coefﬁcient related to the child’s ability measure
attains with 0.218 the highest value. Both father’s and mother’s education have a
highly signiﬁcant and positive effect. The size of the coefﬁcient for the mother is
substantially higher than the one for the father. With respect to the economic
variables we can also observe a signiﬁcant difference between the two. The effect of
the wealth index is substantially higher than the one of consumption. This ﬁnding is
coherent with the ﬁndings by Carneiro and Heckman (2002) who argue that the long
run economic environment matters more than short-term credit constraints. When
considering both economic effects, we see that the economic situation has the
largest direct intergenerational effect on the schooling outcome of the child. In
general, these results are relatively close to what was found in the OLS regression in
Table 4.
Model 1 is estimated on a sample of 4,266 individuals and could potentially
suffer from a sample selection bias. As discussed in the data section, I also estimate
the full model relaxing some requirements on the data. In a ﬁrst step, I include
single mother households by dropping the channel of the father increasing the
sample size to 6,547 individuals. In a second step, I include all households where
data are available on either of the parents and taking the maximum value when both
are available. This allows us to include 143 additional individuals, because in model
1 some were dropped just because of one missing parental characteristic. These
larger sample estimates are reported in Table 11 in the ‘‘Appendix B’’. The general
pattern is very encouraging, as almost no changes in the main regression are
observed. Most coefﬁcients increase slightly, but remain at very similar levels. The
relative importance of the effects remains unchanged. Overall, these additional
regressions give some support on the validity of model 1 since the results hold even
when changing the sample a lot. In what follows, I take model 1 as the benchmark
model, as it is the only one allowing us to control for all different channels.
5.2.1 Direct versus indirect effects
Let us now return to the discussion of model 1 from Table 6. An interesting feature
of simultaneous equation models is that they enable us to compute direct and
indirect effects. For example, it is clear that parental education does not only affect
the schooling outcome through the direct effect discussed before, but also through
the economic situation of the family. Figure 4 shows the direct and indirect effects
based on the results of model 1, fully reported in Table 11. As in the discussion
before, one can easily see that the ability measure of the child has the largest direct
effect (black bars). The wealth index has the second largest direct effect, followed
by the mother’s education. However, the total effect of mother’s education is larger
than the total effect of the wealth index. This is due to the fact that besides the direct
effect we also have an indirect effect of maternal education through both economic
indicators. The same is true for the father, where the relative importance of the
indirect effect is even bigger. Nevertheless, the total effect of father’s education

Finally, parental ability has no direct effect but only indirect effects through the
genetic transmission and the other two channels. The total effects attain values of
about 0.13 for the mother and 0.10 for the father.
5.2.2 Biases when neglecting channels
Models 2–5 in Table 6 only include one of the four possible channels assuming the
others to have no impact. The last model includes the often available data on the
education of parents and the economic situation but not the ability measures. We can
notice that the one-covariate models always give strongly upward biased estimators
of the coefﬁcients, when comparing them to the benchmark model in the ﬁrst
column. Not surprisingly, the bias in relative terms is lower for the important
channels, namely ability and the wealth index, where the new coefﬁcient is roughly
1.5 times higher than in model 1. The upward bias of parental education is much
more important, since the coefﬁcient attains 2–3 times higher values for mother’s and
father’s education, respectively. However, the biases become much smaller when all
but the ability measure are included. Due to missing information of ability measures
in most of the surveys, this setting corresponds to the best we can normally do. The
coefﬁcients are about 20 % higher than that in the benchmark model, which is
considerably less than in models 2–5. More importantly, the relative importance of
the coefﬁcients is very similar in model 6 as compared to model 1.
5.2.3 Regression by age groups
Based on the descriptive ﬁndings presented in Table 2 of increasing intergenerational education correlations with age, a second set of estimation results is
presented in Table 7. Model 1 is estimated for different age groups and additionally

correspond to the age when people are normally in secondary (including high
school) and tertiary education.
As for the simple correlation, I ﬁnd differences between the two age groups. In
general, the coefﬁcients are slightly higher for the older group. A sharp increase is
observed for the effect of mother’s education. The model ﬁt also increases
substantially from the younger the older age group. As for the simple correlations
presented before, there are several possible explanations. First, it could be argued
that this is due to a more precise measure of the dependent variable for the older age
group. The second explanation is that the inequalities in education are a cumulative
process and that the relative importance of the channels can evolve with the age of
the child. Most likely both phenomena are present in these results. The fact that all
indicators become more important supports the idea that the measurement is more
precise for the older group. However, the fact that not all explanatory variables
increase their effect in the same way points to something beyond this argument. In
particular, the coefﬁcient of the mother’s education increases substantially more
than that of the others. Hence, we might have reasons to believe that the impact of
the mother becomes more important with age. This could be due to the role of the
mother in pushing the child to continue at school. Of course, additional research is
required to conﬁrm this conclusion, because the results could also be driven by the
larger precision of the dependent variable.
5.2.4 Regression by gender
Given that mother’s and father’s education have different effects, it might be
interesting to see whether the effects are also different for boys and girls. The last
two columns in table 7 present model 1 for girls and boys, respectively. We can see
that the two economic indicators have slightly higher coefﬁcients for boys while the
child’s ability seems to matter a bit more for girls. The education of the father is

somewhat more important for boys. A large difference can be observed for the role
of mother’s education, which has an almost twice as large effect for girls as
compared to boys. The exact reasons for this difference are beyond the scope of this
analysis, but it might be a very interesting question for future research.

6 Conclusion
The present study tries to contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms
generating the high intergenerational education correlations observed all over the
world and especially in Latin American countries. A particularly important issue is
to distinguish the different channels of transmission outlined by the literature over
the past years. Using very rich data from Mexico, a simultaneous equations model
of the educational transmission can be estimated, allowing me to distinguish
between the different channels: the biological transmission of ability, transmission
through the economic situation and the education-to-education channel. Additional
channels such as health or non-cognitive abilities are not considered in this study.
Unfortunately, the data and especially the unavailability of retrospective information on health did not allow me to include such channels. However, these channels
might be important as they might upward bias the importance of the included
channels, particularly the education-to-education channel. This caveat must be kept
in mind when discussing the results.
The results suggest that the economic situation of the family is the most
important direct intergenerational channel, which has an even larger effect than the
ability of the child when considering the effects of both economic indicators
together. I distinguish between consumption as a proxy of the current economic
situation and a wealth index to capture the long-term economic situation in the
analysis. I ﬁnd a larger effect of the wealth index, which is in accordance with
ﬁndings in the literature. Parental education matters to explain children’s schooling
but not in a very strong way as the intergenerational correlation might lead us to
expect. The mother’s education directly and signiﬁcantly inﬂuences the schooling
outcome of children. The education of the fathers also affects the schooling outcome
directly and has additionally a strong indirect effect through the economic situation
of the family.
The ﬁnding that the economic situation plays an important role suggests that the
current situation is likely not to be efﬁcient. This is due to the non-optimal
investment in education of the poorer children and, therefore, they cannot exploit
their potential. On the other hand, the ﬁnding is encouraging in the sense that the
low educational mobility does not seem to be a fatality. The strong inﬂuence of the
economic situation of the parent can be targeted by public policies. In this respect,
cash transfer programs (conditional or not) might help us to increase social mobility
as they allow poorer families to invest more in education. Over the recent years
many programs were implemented and it is, therefore, possible that they already
generate beneﬁcial effects in terms of educational mobility.
In addition to the main results I also performed the same analysis on sub-samples.

First, the intergenerational links are higher for older children. All coefﬁcients
increase with the age group and particularly the education of the mother becomes
much more important with age. This result might suggest that the intergenerational
links are following a cumulative process, suggesting that even at higher ages policy
interventions can be useful. However, the differences found for the different age
groups could also be due to the more precise measure of the educational attainment
for the older age group. Additional research is required to distinguish the two
possible explanations found in this study.
Second, I ﬁnd differences in the relative importance of transmission channels
between girls and boys. The economic situation of the family matters slightly more
for boys while the ability of the child is somewhat more important for girls. The
biggest gender difference is found for maternal education. The effect of maternal
education is almost twice as high for girls as compared to boys.
The analysis demonstrates that estimates ignoring important alternative channels
of transmission tend to overestimate the effects of the analyzed variables.
Remaining unobserved channels such as personality traits could upward bias my
results to a certain extent. Nevertheless, the used data does not allow me to consider
additional channels as they would imply a large drop in the sample sizes and
increase the problem of a non-random sample. Finally, the analysis should be seen
as a piece among others in the recent literature aiming at understanding the
mechanisms of educational mobility. For future research I see mainly three
interesting directions. First, it would be useful to conduct similar analyses for other
countries with low educational mobility to see whether the ﬁndings hold also
outside the Mexican context. Second, the results suggest that cash transfer programs
could potentially help us to increase educational mobility. Future research could
look at this effect and try to ﬁnd out more about the most effective speciﬁcities of
such programs. Third, while most effects were relatively stable across sub-samples,
the effect of maternal education changes substantially with age and gender of the
child. It would, therefore, be interesting to further investigate the role of the mother
in the intergenerational transmission of education.

Appendix A: The education index: distribution and relevance
The goal of this appendix is to show that the education index used in the study is a

additional information on the Mexican education system. I start by discussing how
an educational delay is related to the ﬁnal level of education.
Relevance of the education index
As outlined in Sect. 4.1.1, it is assumed that the education index is related to the
years of education once the individual leaves school. That is, a delay in school at an
early age should be translated in getting less education. School delay at early ages
can arise from late entry to the educational system or repeating grades. In Table 8 I
present a simple OLS regression of the years of education on the number of grade
repetitions in primary school and the years of delay to start school. The data come
from the same survey as the main analysis of the paper, but here I use only people
no longer attending school.
We can see that already a late entry of 1 year is related to a decrease of total
schooling of about 1 year, while students entering the system 2–4 years later have
on average between 3 and 4 years less years of education in the end. Grade
repetition has also a negative effect on total schooling, where 1 repetition is broadly
related with one year less of schooling. It is important to notice that I do not claim
that this regression identiﬁes causal effects, which is actually not needed to show the
utility of the chosen educational index.
The Mexican education system
The Mexican education system is characterized by 6 years of primary education,
followed by 6 years of secondary education. Secondary education is divided in 3
years of lower secondary education (secundaria) and 3 years of upper secondary

Table 11 displays in the ﬁrst column the full estimation results of model 1 already

Let me highlight some interesting results I did not discuss in the main body of the
paper. The education production function estimates are very similar for the mother
and the father. The cognitive ability and the place of living at the age of 12 years
have the large positive and the age and the indigenous background negative effects.
For both the long- and the short-run economic situation the fact of being indigenous
has a negative impact, even when controlling for education.

The dependent variable for the structural equation is reported in parenthesis in the title of each panel. The
coefﬁcients are reported in the ﬁrst column and the standard errors in the second for each model. All
coefﬁcients are standardized, meaning that for continuous regressors the coefﬁcients measure how many
standard deviations the dependent variable changes when the regressor changes one standard deviation
and for dichotomous variables when the variables turn from zero to one. Signiﬁcance levels *** 1 %, **

The second and third regressions are based on enlarged samples. The ﬁrst
enlarged sample includes also the single-mother households and excludes as a
consequence the channel of the father. The second enlarged sample considers
always the highest values of either the mother or the father. As already mentioned in
the main text, the results do not change a lot despite the substantial change in the
sample size.
The role of mother’s ability increases in the ability equation when not controlling
for the ability level of the father. This is due to the correlation among the IQ of both
parents. The effect of consumption is slightly higher in the large sample regressions,
but remains always considerably smaller than the effect of the wealth index. When
merging the education of the two parents, the combined effect is somewhat larger
than the effect of the mother in the main regression, but does not attain the sum of
the two parental coefﬁcients. The relatively stable results give additional credibility
to the results on the main sample used in the study.

Appendix C: Discussion of the wealth index
In the analysis, I use a wealth index to approximate the long run economic situation
of the household. In this appendix, I ﬁrst present the way it was constructed and then
I discuss the concern that such a wealth index could actually capture an age effect of
the parents.
Construction of the wealth index
Let me ﬁrst discuss how the wealth index is constructed. I use the ﬁrst component of
a principal component analysis performed on various indicators. This allows me to
reduce the dimensions and to have a single indicator. In this appendix, I present the
descriptive statistics of the indicator variables and the composition of the used
wealth indicator. Table 12 displays the mean of each variable and its relative
contribution to the wealth index.

From these ﬁgures, we see that the contribution substantially varies across
indicators and therefore a simple average of the indicator variable would probably
not well describe wealth. Among the most important contributors, we ﬁnd the clean
cooking energy, the clean garbage evacuation, the availability of a phone and the
indicator for a clean ﬂoor. Rather of minor importance are the indicators for having
a kitchen in the household and whether the household has access to electricity. The
reason for these low contribution levels is the almost full coverage among the
Mexican population and the resulting small variance in these variables.

The main results of the study show that the long run economic situation proxied by
the wealth index is a main channel of transmission from one generation to the next.
A potential concern with this variable stems from the fact that household assets
could be directly linked to the age of the parents. If older parents have
systematically more of these goods and therefore a higher wealth index, then we
might actually capture an age effect rather than an effect of the economic channel.
In the regressions, I control for the parental age to deal with this concern.
Nevertheless, a closer look at the relationship between the wealth index and parental
age can help us to reduce the concerns even more.
Figure 5 displays the non-parametric regression of degree 1 of the standardized
wealth index (left axis) as a function of average parental age (left graph) and the
child–parents age differential (right graph). The dashed line in each graph is a
density estimation of the average parental age and the child–parents age differential,
respectively.
We can observe that the average of the wealth index is slightly below 0 for the
youngest parents. However, the density of such young parents is rather small. For
the remaining part of the parental age distribution the average is very close to zero.
This is also true in the right graph where the variable on the x-axis is the age
differential between parents and the child. The estimator of the mean is very close to
zero for all values of the age differential.

In general, we cannot observe a strong relationship between the wealth index and
the age of the parents. Thus, it is unlikely that the wealth index actually captures an
age effect of the parents.

Appendix D: Identiﬁcation of the simultaneous equations model
In this appendix, I discuss the identiﬁcation of the model presented in Eqs. (1)–(6)
in the main body of the article. To simplify the notation, the endogenous left-hand
side variables of the Eqs. (1)–(6) can be combined in the matrix Y and all
exogenous variables in matrix X, which includes all exogenous variables in white
boxes in Fig. 2. This allows us to rewrite the model in the standard simultaneous
equation model (SEM) notation:
Y ¼ B Y þ AX þ n

ð 7Þ

where n is a vector containing the error terms of the equations, B is a zero-diagonal
coefﬁcient matrix for the endogenous variables and A is the coefﬁcient matrix for
the exogenous variables. Let me further deﬁne U to be covariance matrix of X and
W to be the covariance matrix of the disturbance terms n. We impose a condition
that the exogenous variables X are uncorrelated with the error terms in n. The model
described before, has the following matrix B and I assume the following covariance
matrix19 W:

This model has a lower triangular matrix B which greatly simpliﬁes its identiﬁcation. However, it is not a recursive model because I do not assume W to be diagonal.20 While a recursive model would be automatically identiﬁed, the conditions
for this model are somewhat more complicated. To discuss the identiﬁcation of the
model I follow Heuchenne (1997) and Paxton et al. (2011). Heuchenne (1997)
proposes a sufﬁcient rule for identiﬁcation based on B and W exclusively. He

The covariance matrix is symmetric. For presentational purpose, I only present the upper triangular
version.

I only assume uncorrelated error terms for the ability transmission Eq. (1) and the child’s education
Eq. (6). This last assumption is conﬁrmed by the IV estimates I will present in Sect. 5.1. Note, however,

The number (in bold) on the diagonal indicate how many excluded parameters are
above in the same column and to the left of the same row. For instance, the value of
3 in the third row is obtained by counting the two zero values in the third row left to
the diagonal and the zero value in the third column above the diagonal. Heuchenne
(1997) shows that equation k is identiﬁed whenever the corresponding value on the
diagonal is bigger or equal to ðk À 1). We can see that all but Eqs. (4) and (5) satisfy
this sufﬁcient condition. Hence, we can conclude that all but the economic situation
equations are identiﬁed based on the lower triangular form of B and the structure of
W.
To verify if also Eqs. (4) and (5) are identiﬁed, we have to use conditions that are
not only based on B but also on A, the coefﬁcient matrix of the exogenous variables.
All equations in the model pass the order condition saying that an equation is
identiﬁed if the number of excluded exogenous variables is equal or greater than the
number of endogenous variables in that equation minus one (Paxton et al. 2011).
The order condition is, however, only a sufﬁcient condition. A stronger necessary
condition is the equivalent structures approach, which is an algebraic identiﬁcation
technique (Paxton et al. 2011). For this, let us rewrite Eq. (7) by regrouping all
parameters related to the vector Y on the left-hand side.
BY ¼ AX þ n

ð10Þ

By doing so, matrix B has a unit diagonal and all off-diagonal elements change the
sign. This change of notation does not change the system but is more convenient for
the computation of the equivalent structures approach. Let us now deﬁne a general
matrix M and deﬁne the following set of equations:
MA ¼ A

MB ¼ B

M RM 0 ¼ R

ð11Þ

The model is fully identiﬁed if the only solution to this system obtained by using the
restrictions on A, B and W is the identity matrix (M ¼ I). Let us start with the

Finally, we have six equations with two unknown, which makes it very easy to
determine the two remaining elements of M. For instance, using the ﬁrst equation
we can deﬁne m65 ¼ À cc3 m64 and plug this into the second row to ﬁnd that
11
m64 ¼ m65 ¼ 0.
Note that using the restrinctions on A and B allows us to solve the whole matrix
M and we ﬁnd M ¼ I. The full model is therefore identiﬁed.

Appendix E: Regressions with additional dimensions
The results in the main body of the article include only three channels. However,
there might be other important channels affecting the intergenerational transmission
of education. For instance, health, non-cognitive abilities or personality traits could
be transmitted from one generation to the next and affect education.
Unfortunately, the data used in this study do not allow to include such channels.
There are two main reasons why I cannot include these channels in the analysis.
First, including indicators on personality traits would substantially reduce the
sample size and, therefore, increase the risk of sample selection biases. Second, for
the health dimensions, no retrospective information about the health status of
parents is provided. Hence, we could observe the health status of parents at the time
of the survey, but not at the relevant time when children were attending school.
In this appendix, I present experimental regressions to show what would happen,
if despite the problems we would try to include these channels. Table 13 displays
the OLS regression reported in Table 4 in the main body of the text and an
augmented version, where I include some parental health and behavioral variables.
The mental health indicator is based on 18 questions about the emotional
situation of individuals and combined through a factor analysis. A higher value
indicates more emotional problems. Parental height can have an inﬂuence as it

Model A is the same model as reported in Table 4 as OLS. Model B includes additional explanatory
variables and Model C uses the variables of Model A and the sample of Model B. All regressions include
also additional control variables such as mother’s and father’s age and indigenous background, an
indicator for rural areas (none of these is signiﬁcant). Additionally state ﬁxed effects and control variables
of government aid programs are included but not reported. Robust standard errors are reported

Black et al. 2007). In respect to personality traits and behaviors, I include a
dichotomous variables on the self-reported self conﬁdence, on the importance of
respecting rules and whether at least one of the parents aims at planning their
ﬁnancial situations more than just a couple of days ahead.
The results of the table underline the discussed difﬁculties. First, we can observe
a sharp drop in the sample size, which substantially increases the problem of a nonrandom sample. Second, the coefﬁcients of the newly added variables are mostly not
signiﬁcant. This can be due to the quality of the indicators themselves, but also to
the fact that we do not observe the values for the relevant period. For instance, the
mental health today is much less relevant than the mental health when the child was
at school. Finally, the parameters of main interest for the study are only very little
affected by the inclusion of these variables. When comparing to the baseline model
estimated on the same sample as the augmented model, we can see only very little
variation. Of course, this is also due to the poor explanatory power of the included
variables.

1 Introduction
Education is a main ingredient for a successful life in modern societies. However, in
many countries the opportunities to get well educated strongly depend on the family
background, particularly in Latin America. As a result, we observe very low
intergenerational mobility. Understanding the mechanisms generating this intergenerational persistence in education is essential to target policy measures
adequately.

In this paper, I try to shed some light on this mechanism by applying a
simultaneous equations model to data from Mexico. The main goal of the study was
to estimate the relative importance of different transmission channels and their
interactions.
The three main mechanisms put forward in recent theoretical and empirical
contributions can be broadly described as being the biological, the economic and the
direct education-to-education channel.
The biological channel refers to the genetic transmission of ability, often
measured by the IQ, which explains a part of the relationship (Anger and Heineck
¨
2010; van Leeuwen et al. 2008; Bjorklund et al. 2010; Black et al. 2009).
Poor families facing credit constraints are an example for the economic channel,
because they cannot borrow against the expected future earnings of their offspring,
which generates a link between the socioeconomic situation of the parents and the
schooling of their children (see for instance Black and Devereux 2010; Attanasio
and Kaufmann 2009; Stinebrickner and Stinebrickner 2007; Carneiro and Heckman
2002; Alfonso 2009).
Finally, a higher return to education for children with highly educated parents is
an argument for the direct education-to-education channel (Black and Devereux
2010). It might also include preferences for education, non-cognitive skills,
aspirations and many other factors.
The empirical literature focuses on estimating the causal effect of parental
education on children’s education. Holmlund et al. (2011) revise this literature and
propose a comparison of different methods applied to the same dataset from
Sweden. They conclude that the estimates differ substantially across identiﬁcation
strategies and that no method is perfect. They ﬁnd relatively modest causal effects
of parental education and point to the importance of analyzing in more detail other
mechanisms explaining the intergenerational transmission of education. They
hypothesize about the possibility of an indirect effect of education through better
socioeconomic environment that can be offered to children. This conclusion on the
need of better understanding the mechanisms is shared by recent literature surveys
¨
¨
such as Black and Devereux (2010), Bjorklund and Jantti (2009) and Piketty (2000)
who coherently argue that more empirical research must be undertaken to
understand the mechanisms behind educational mobility and social mobility in
general. Black and Devereux (2010, p. 69) conclude that ‘‘[...] there is still much
work to do to pin down which family background factors are most important’’ and
¨
¨
Bjorklund and Jantti (2009, p. 516) argue that ‘‘a major challenge for future
research is to ﬁnd out what in the family other than income is important for the
future of children’’.
This study tries to contribute in the proposed direction by moving from the
estimation of one single causal effect to the estimation of a larger system of effects,
incorporating simultaneously the three channels previously outlined. This focus on
different mechanisms at the same time aims at getting a better understanding of the
larger picture—the whole process of intergenerational transmission of education. In
this respect, this approach should be seen as a complement to the single causal effect

The choice of Mexican data is primarily motivated by the importance of high
intergenerational correlations in education in Latin America. Hertz et al. (2007)
compare educational mobility of 42 countries including 7 Latin American ones.
These seven countries take the ﬁrst seven places ranked according to their
intergenerational education correlation. The country with the highest correlation is
Peru (0.66), followed by Ecuador, Panama and Chile.
Within Latin American Countries, Mexico displays relatively high intergenerational persistence in education. Dahan and Gaviria (2001) compare 16 Latin
American countries using data from the late 1990s and ﬁnd that Mexico has the
second lowest intergenerational mobility level behind El Salvador. de Hoyos et al.
(2010) use recent data on social mobility in Mexico. They report correlations
between the education in years of parents and children, ﬁnding the highest
correlation of about 0.6 for the children cohorts born between 1942 and 1951,
followed by a reduction of the correlation to about 0.5 for the cohort 1962–1971 and
ﬁnally a new increase of the correlation to 0.55 for the youngest cohort, composed
of children born between 1972 and 1981. According to the same authors, this recent
increase is even higher when using different data sources. The same pattern of
increasing educational mobility prior to the economic crisis in the 1980s and a
subsequent decrease was found by Binder and Woodruff (2002), who use different
cohorts to estimate the intergenerational link.
Hence, the Mexican case is not only interesting on its own but might be
representative for other Latin American Countries. Moreover, another advantage of
Mexico is the high-quality data available. The suitability of the survey for this study
is underlined by the availability of cognitive ability scores. Nevertheless, the
analysis faces a series of empirical challenges in the form of trade-offs. This study
tries to ﬁnd a balance between a more complete model with very high data
requirements and a simpler model in which less data are lost due to unavailable
information.
The main result is that even when controlling for parental education and ability,
the economic situation of the family has the largest direct effect on the schooling
outcome of children. This important source of inequality of opportunity could be
reduced by policy interventions targeting the link between economic requirements
and schooling. Moreover, the estimation shows that there are important interactions
between the channels, suggesting that the exclusion of some channels might
seriously bias estimates.
In Sect. 2 I will review the literature on the mechanisms of educational mobility
motivating my empirical models I present in Sect. 3. In Sect. 4 I describe the data
used and especially the needed transformations in detail and present some
descriptive evidence. In Sect. 5 I present the main results, which are complemented
by some ﬁgures in ‘‘Appendix B’’. Finally, Sect. 6 concludes the paper.

2 Theory and empirical evidence on educational mobility
Intergenerational mobility in education is a complex phenomenon that does not rely

(Chevalier 2004). The ﬁrst channel is the biological transmission of ability, the
second refers to the dependence of schooling outcome on the economic situation of
the parents and the third deals with direct education-to-education effects. In this
section, I present some theoretical and empirical contributions to the understanding
of these channels.
2.1 Ability transmission through genes: the biological channel
The direct transmission of abilities, which is not limited to simple IQ transmission,
represents a biological explanation of the phenomenon. For instance, Becker and
Tomes (1979) use the term endowments acquired from parents to describe this
direct transmission. They provide a theory of intergenerational transmission based
on rational choices through a human capital theory approach, where the ability level
of the offspring is a key determinant of the decision. Their model was consequently
extended by Loury (1981) and Solon (2004) and serves as a benchmark in many
analyses.
Empirically, much work has been done to determine the importance of this
channel. In a meta-analysis of 212 IQ studies, Devlin et al. (1997) quantify the
genetic transmission and ﬁnd the broad-sense heritability of IQ to be 48 %.
Social scientists put more emphasis on quantifying the overall IQ correlations
between parents and children, which might also include environmental effects in
addition to the pure heritability measured by Devlin et al. (1997). For instance,
Anger and Heineck (2010) use German panel-data with two ultra-short IQ-tests to
estimate the parent-offspring relation. They ﬁnd that a 1-point increase in parents’
score results in a 0.45-point increase in the coding speed (inherent ability) and 0.50point increase in word ﬂuency scores. The estimated coefﬁcients remain stable at
¨
the inclusion and exclusion of control variables. Bjorklund et al. (2010) use Swedish
data from military IQ tests and ofﬁcial registers. They estimate intergenerational
and sibling IQ correlations. The estimated values are all highly signiﬁcant and attain
values of 0.346 for father-son, 0.510 for siblings and 0.65 for twins. According to
the authors, their estimations represent rather a lower bound of the true values.
Black et al. (2009) ﬁnd a similar father-son IQ-correlation (0.38) in a comparable
study with Norwegian data.
van Leeuwen et al. (2008) go even further in the analysis of IQ-transmission by
dividing it further up. No evidence for cultural transmission of the IQ was found and
no indication that intelligent parents provide children with intelligence promoting
circumstances. Individual differences in intelligence were found to be largely
accounted for by genetic differences. Moreover, they ﬁnd a spousal IQ-correlation
of about 0.33 suggesting a relatively high degree of assortative mating.
2.2 Credit constraints and the economic situation: the economic channel
According to the logic of the economic channel the intergenerational correlation in
education is the fruit of an underinvestment in education by poor families. This idea

the human capital of their offspring impossible can be found, for example, in
Banerjee and Newman (1994) and Loury (1981).
Empirical research was not able to conclude on the exact importance of credit
constraints and the economic environment in general. While it seems that the impact
of credit constraints is relatively modest in richer countries, some evidence was
found that in developing countries the effect is larger.
Stinebrickner and Stinebrickner (2007) analyze the situation at a college in the
US using panel data of students. They ﬁnd that a group of students is credit
constrained in consumption during their stay at the college, but that many of them
are not willing to borrow.
Carneiro and Heckman (2002) critically revise the literature on the question of
credit constraints. They compute that using modern US data, only about 8 % of
students really face short-term credit constraints. They argue that long-term effects,
such as the family environment during the whole schooling period of children, play
a much bigger role. Winter (2007) elaborates a computable general equilibrium
model to evaluate the role of credit constraints in the decision whether to go to
college. The model is calibrated for the US economy and predicts observed patterns
quite well. The ﬁndings contrast the results of few credit constrained students found
by other studies and argue that econometric estimates such as in Carneiro and
Heckman (2002) are downward-biased. In line with the results of other studies is the
observation that the share of people ﬁnancially constrained has increased
(dramatically) over the past decades.
Alfonso (2009) presents a study of 4 Latin American countries (Mexico, Chile,
Colombia and Peru). She shows that the effect of credit constraints disappears in
regression analysis when controlling for long run family variables (parental
education, family assets, etc.). However, the relatively small effect of credit
constraints increases from the oldest to the newest datasets used in the study.
Attanasio and Kaufmann (2009) use Mexican data to analyze the relationship
between post-secondary school decisions and subjective expectations. Among other
ﬁndings on the role of expectations, they show that credit constraints represent an
important issue for poor Mexicans, in contrast to some literature coming from
higher developed countries, where these effects do not seem to be as present.
To sum up, the literature ﬁnds evidence for the existence of the economic
channel in producing high intergenerational correlations in education. It remains
somewhat unclear if short-run credit constraints or the long-run economic situation
are more important determinants. It seems, however, that in developing countries,
both contribute to the low educational mobility.
2.3 Education to education transmission
Finally, the third channel considered is the direct effect of parental education on the
schooling attainment of the children. This channel is generally known as the nurture
effect, capturing the direct causal effect of parental education (Holmlund et al.
2011; Chevalier 2004). Dickson et al. (2013) show that this direct causal effect starts
at very early ages and remains visible years later when comparing students’

causal effect can be found in the literature. One possible explanation is that highly
educated parents tend to encourage their children more to achieve high levels of
education (Merton 1953; Boudon 1973, 1974; Sewel and Shah 1968). For instance,
Steinberg et al. (1992) show that parental encouragement and parental school
involvement have important effects on the school performance of children. Besides
this active encouragement and involvement of parents, it can also be argued that the
child’s aspirations increase when parents have more education (Sewel and Shah
1968; Ermisch et al. 2006). Ermisch et al. (2006) argue that parental education can
alter the productivity of parents’ time investments in children. It could also be
argued that expected returns to education depend on parental education. Jensen
(2010) shows that students with higher educated parents tend to perceive higher
returns to education. Hence, this third channel is motivated by a series of arguments
and most likely composed of different sub-channels. The distinction of these
different sub-channels is beyond the scope of this paper. In this paper I consider a
compound channel linking high parental education to high offspring’s schooling.

3 Model
3.1 Conceptual model of educational mobility
Following the literature outlined in the previous section, we can easily illustrate the
three transmission channels. Figure 1 displays the system of transmission in
education suggested by the literature.

presented in this study. Arrows refer to direct causal effects. Only channels that are included in the

First, there is a direct link between abilities of parents and children, presented
with the dotted line. The ability of the parents inﬂuences the ability of children,
which in turn increases their propensity for education. The economic channel is
represented by gray arrows using the compound term economic situation, which
includes short-term credit constraints and long-run effects of assets. Finally, the
third channel illustrated with solid black arrows represents the direct education-toeducation transmission, which is based on many different hypotheses as explained
above.
A channel that I do not consider in this study is the health channel. The health
status of the child is likely to be inﬂuenced by the family background on the one
hand (Bradley and Corwyn 2002; Rosa Dias 2009; Delajara and Wendelspiess
´
´
Chavez Juarez 2013), while it might also have important effects for education on the
other hand (Case et al. 2005; Doyle et al. 2009). There are two reasons for not
including this channel, both related to the data. First, there is a problem of timing in
the health data. While the literature emphasizes on the importance of the prenatal
period and early childhood in the health dimension (Heckman 2006; Doyle et al.
´
´
2009; Delajara and Wendelspiess Chavez Juarez 2013), in the data I can at most
observe the current health status of the child. Unfortunately there is no retrospective
information on the child’s health conditions at birth available. Second, as I will
highlight in Sect. 4 the inclusion of additional variables would seriously reduce the
sample and increase the risk of sample selection problems. In the ‘‘Appendix E’’ I
present some regressions where I include variables for health and personality traits
to illustrate the problems just described.
Different strategies are possible to analyze such a framework empirically. One
way is to focus on one particular link. For instance, Holmlund et al. (2011) present
different methods to estimate the causal relationship between the education of
parents and children. In this paper I use two different strategies. First, I focus on a
single equation approach where I aim at estimating all the determinants of the
child’s education outcome in one regression. In a second step, I move to a
simultaneous equations model where I estimate several equations to describe the
whole system outlined in Fig. 1. I will now explain the two approaches along with
their intuition, advantages and challenges.
3.2 The single regression approach
The main goal of the empirical application is to estimate the intergenerational links
determining the educational outcome of the child. Therefore, a ﬁrst empirical
approach consists in regressing the educational outcome on the possible intergenerational determinants while controlling for some contemporaneous effects. The
intergenerational determinants are parental education and the economic situation of
the family. Moreover, I also control for parental age, whether the parents have an
indigenous background and some variables capturing the family structure1. The
most important contemporaneous effect I control for is the cognitive ability of the
1

These variables include the number of children (up to 12 years old) and teenagers (12–18 years old) in

child. Additionally, I also control for contemporaneous effects such as child labor,
government program beneﬁts, state ﬁxed effects and indicators for girls and rural
areas.
Besides its appealing simplicity, the single regression approach has the advantage
that we do not have to impose a lot of structure in the model. Therefore, only the
standard assumptions for ordinary least squared must be fulﬁlled. One concern that
could arise is that some variables do not satisfy these conditions and are likely to be
correlated with the error term. The most likely reason for this to happen in our
context is an omitted variable bias. A ﬁrst critical variable is the ability level of the
child, which might also capture for instance motivation or the ability to perform
well in a situation of examination. Both potentially omitted variables are also likely
to inﬂuence the schooling outcome. To a large extent, these concerns are reduced by
the type of cognitive ability measure I am using in this study. The ability measure is
based on a short version of the Raven’s progressive matrices test, which is one of
´
the most culture-free and education independent IQ-tests (Desert et al. 2009). I
discuss this in more detail when describing the data in Sect. 4. A second variable
that might suffer an omitted variable bias is parental education, as parental
education might also be inﬂuenced by preferences and taste for education. If these
preferences and tastes are also transmitted to the next generation, we are likely to
have an endogeneity problem as well.
In order to account for these potential endogeneity issues I also perform
instrumental variable regressions for the single regression approach. Father’s and
mother’s cognitive ability is used to instrument both the parental education and the
child’s ability level. The cognitive ability of the parents should be a strong predictor
of both parental education2 and the cognitive ability of the child. At the same time,
the cognitive ability of the parents should not have a direct impact on the schooling
outcome of the child. For the case of parental education, I additionally use
information on the place of living of the parents when they were 12 years old. A
dummy capturing whether they lived in a town or not is used.3 The idea is that
parents living in cities had substantially more access to education than parents living
in rural areas. At the same time, the place of living of the parents when they were 12
years old should not directly affect the education outcome of their children today. In
the results section, I will present in detail the different tests for the instruments,
which clearly indicate that the instruments are valid and strong.
Let me ﬁrst introduce the second estimation approach, where I simultaneously
estimate the whole system presented in Fig. 1.

2

The use of parental cognitive ability to instrument parental education could be problematic if the ability
measure was inﬂuenced by the education. However, as mentioned in the data section, the used RPM test is
less education dependent than other measures of cognitive ability. Therefore, I argue that the assumption
of no reversed causality might be reasonable. Additionally, I discuss the empirical tests related to the
validity of the instruments.

The original variable included more categories to describe the situation outside towns. However, they
were relatively unclear and did not provide additional explanatory power. For this reason, I regrouped all

3.3 The simultaneous regression approach
In addition to the single regression approach previously presented, I also use a
simultaneous equations model approach to estimate not only the intergenerational
links, but also the different transmission channels in more detail. There are two
main advantages of focusing on the whole system. First, it allows us to estimate the
relative importance of the three channels put forward by the literature. This is
important because analyzing a speciﬁc channel and ﬁnding signiﬁcant effects does
not tell us much about the relative importance of the analyzed channel with respect
to other possible channels. A channel might show very signiﬁcant effects and at the
same time be relatively irrelevant for the whole system. Second, estimating a system
allows us to consider interactions between channels and as a consequence direct and
indirect effects. For instance, parents’ ability is likely to have both of them. The
direct link effect of parental ability refers to the biological channel introduced
earlier. The indirect effect goes through parental education and the economic
situation. More able parents are likely to have more education and a better
socioeconomic status. Behrman and Rosenzweig (2002) show that intergenerational
correlations between mother’s and children’s education might be biased when such
system aspects are not considered. For instance, they mention that such estimates
are upward biased, when not controlling for the ability channel or for assortative
mating.
On the other hand, the estimation of the model as a whole might also has some
disadvantages. We might overestimate the effect of the three analyzed channels due
to relevant but unobserved channels. Such unobserved channels might include the
health channel discussed earlier or some soft skills like personality traits and noncognitive abilities. I will discuss this issue in the description of the econometric
model and the empirical analysis with more detail. First, I will formally introduce
the econometric model, which can be written as follows:

of the family or the child. An alternative way of presenting the model is the path
diagram in Fig. 2.
The white ﬁlled boxes refer to exogenous variables, the gray boxes represent
endogenous variables and the arrows describe direct effects. Note that for the sake
of readability of the graph, I present both parents and both economic indicators
together. Even though the graphical representation is more illustrative, I will now
discuss the model mainly based on the equations presented above.
Equation (1) describes the genetic transmission of cognitive ability, where the
main explanatory factors of the child’s ability are the parental cognitive ability
scores.4 Additionally to the parental ability scores, I add some control variables such
as the gender of the child, a dummy for ﬁrst-born children and two dummies for
children with a small (\20 years) and large ( [ 40 years) age difference to their
parents. Parental education is excluded from this regression because we can assume
that there is no direct effect on the cognitive ability score of the child. This
assumption is based on the nature of the used cognitive ability test, which is
´
education- and culture-independent (Desert et al. 2009). For the same reason, no
feedback effect from education to ability is included. The economic situation is not
included as an explanatory variable because the transmission through genes took

place at birth, while the economic situation indicators are contemporaneous values
and have, therefore, no direct effect.
Equations (2) and (3) are simpliﬁed education production functions for the father
and the mother, respectively. The idea is to link parental ability to their schooling
outcome and to control for cohort- and ethnicity-based differences in the
educational level of parents. I also include the instrument of the single regression
approach capturing the place of living of the parents when they were 12 years old.
The idea is that parents that grew up in towns had substantially better access to
schooling than those living in the countryside. Both indicators of the economic
situation are excluded from this regression because of the timing of these variables.
The economic situation today does not directly explain the educational achievement
of the parents when they were in the schooling age.
Equations (4) and (5) estimate the effect of parental education and ability on the
two indicators of the economic situation. The economic situation is split into
consumption and a wealth index. This index was obtained by taking the ﬁrst
component of a principal component analysis on several indicators of durable good
holdings and housing conditions.5 Taking this index instead of the full set of
indicator variables allows me to reduce the dimensionality and to use the wealth
index as an indicator for the long-run economic situation. The use of both, the
wealth index and the current consumption level, is motivated by the ﬁndings in the
literature, saying that the (long-run) economic environment is more important than
current consumption. In addition to the exogenous variables, the economic situation
is also inﬂuenced by parental education.
Finally, Eq. (6) is the main equation corresponding to the single equation
approach outlined before. The explanatory variables of interest are parental
education, the economic situation indicators and the ability score of the child. I also
control for some contemporaneous effects by including control variables capturing
the family structure, the place of living, the government program beneﬁts, the
working conditions of the child and the gender of the child.
To sum up, the coefﬁcients of main interest are the b’s and to a lesser extent the
w’s. The b’s estimate the direct impact of family background variables and the
child’s ability on educational attainment. The w’s permit us to estimate the
relationship between parental and child’s ability, i.e. estimating the biological
transmission. Through the w’s and b1 the total effect of the biological transmission
on the educational outcome can be estimated. This setting allows us to estimate the
relative importance of the different channels in the educational transmission. The
model is estimated using the maximum likelihood method under normality
´
assumptions (Muthen 2004). In contrast to the instrumental variables techniques
used in the single equation approach, the identiﬁcation of the simultaneous equation
model is somewhat more complicated to show. The model presented in this paper is
easily identiﬁed due to its quasi-recursive structure. I use the term quasi-recursive
because I do not assume independence of the error terms for contemporaneous
equations. As a consequence, I use more restrictive identifying conditions to show

5


that all parameters in all equations are identiﬁed. A detailed discussion of the
identiﬁcation conditions along with the proofs can be found in the ‘‘Appendix D’’.

4 Data
4.1 Data description
The analysis of this paper requires very complete data at the micro level for both
children and parents. The Mexican Family Life Survey (MXFLS)6 is a very rich and
award-winning panel data project from Mexico and ﬁts these requirements quite
well. I use information from the ﬁrst two waves (2002 and 2005), focusing on the
latter wave. The panel structure was mainly used to reduce the amount of
measurement errors, for instance, by identifying and correcting impossible values
for time invariant variables.7 To the extent of my knowledge, this is the best data
source from a Latin American Country for this kind of analysis, particularly because
it includes short cognitive ability tests. Nevertheless, the data are not perfect and
before starting with the analysis I discuss some trade-offs faced and the resulting
decisions taken.
4.1.1 Choosing the age range of the sample and the schooling outcome variable
A ﬁrst challenge is to choose correctly the age range of the primary units of analysis.
In order to estimate properly the correlation of years in education one would have to
limit the analysis to people having ﬁnished their education, i.e. mostly people over
25, implying two major problems.
First, older individuals are probably no longer living with their parents. However,
as I do not have administrative data, I can only establish the link between children
and parents when they are living in the same household. Those still living with their
parents years after completing school are most likely not representative for the
whole population.
The second problem is that the schooling period of older people having ﬁnished
education lies potentially far in the past. Therefore, the economic situation for that
time would be hard to proxy and the mechanisms I would analyze would be those
prevailing some years ago, which is not necessarily very policy relevant.
At the lower bound of the age range we cannot include too young children, as
they are only about to start their educational path. Therefore, the information on
years of schooling is likely to be much less related to their ﬁnal schooling outcome
as compared to slightly older children.
For these reasons, I focus on children and young adults from 12 to 25 years and
use a constructed education index instead of years of schooling. The idea behind this

Fig. 3 Distribution of the education index. The ﬁgure displays the distribution of the main dependent
variable (education index) as a function of age. Both graphics are based on the working sample used in
the main regressions

index is very simple: instead of measuring the ﬁnal outcome, I consider the delay in
schooling that people have with respect to their peers. The index is computed by
dividing an individual’s years of schooling by the average years of schooling of her
age cohort. A value of 1 corresponds to a child that is just on time compared to its
peers; a value below 1 suggests a delay.
Figure 3 displays some key statistics by age on the left side and the cumulative
density function of the education index on the right side. The cumulative
distribution function is depicted by age groups corresponding to students in the
age of secondary and high school education (12–17 years) and tertiary education
(18–25 years), respectively.
On the left graph we can see that the dispersion of the index is relatively stable
for the ages corresponding to secondary and high school. For the ages
corresponding to tertiary education the dispersion increases, especially the 95th
percentile increases. This change is due to the fact that a substantial proportion of
individuals do not continue education beyond the high school level. Therefore, the
reference level remains at lower levels and those actually attending tertiary
education achieve higher levels of the education index. On the right-hand side
graph we can see that there is a considerable amount of variation in the index,
starting at values close to zero for those with no or very little education and going
up to almost 2. For the younger age group a stronger concentration around the
value of 1 can be observed. This is due to the fact that less variation in the years
of education is observed.8
The underlying assumption of this indicator is that a delay in schooling is
translated later on in fewer years of schooling. In ‘‘Appendix A’’ I present some
empirical evidence of this relationship and provide some additional information on
the Mexican education system, along with some basic statistics such as enrollment
rates.

Note that when plotting the cumulative density function by age, we even ﬁnd for the youngest children

4.1.2 Variable selection and construction
A second data challenge is to include as much relevant information as possible by
minimizing the cost in terms of loss of observations due to missing values. My
strategy in the variable selection process was to give absolute priority to the three
main channels discussed earlier. At the same time, I tried to avoid unnecessary loss
of observations due to less relevant variables. To face this trade-off I started by
deﬁning a set of absolutely needed variables which cannot be excluded from the
analysis without seriously changing the model. For this type of variables, dropping
observations due to missing values is unavoidable. A second series of interesting but
not absolutely indispensable variables was selected trying to avoid variables that
would cause a large loss of observations. In this respect, some variables potentially
able to capture soft skills and personality traits were excluded, because too many
observations would have been lost.9
One of the main reasons to use the MXFLS data is the availability of cognitive
ability measures based on Raven’s progressive matrices (RPM). According to
´
Desert et al. (2009) RPM is a frequently used intelligence test with proven reliability
´
and validity in measuring cognitive aptitudes and reasoning. Desert et al. (2009)
further highlight that this IQ test is less education dependent than others, reducing
the risk of feedback effects from education.10 Different versions of the test were
applied to children (5–12 years) and adults (13–65 years). In order to have
comparable scores across age groups, the values were normalized to a distribution
with mean 100 and standard deviation 15 for each age. The choice to normalize to
the mean and standard deviation of the IQ is essentially for illustrative purpose, but
it does not imply that the cognitive ability scores can be seen as a complete measure
of IQ. Moreover, the normalization is not relevant for the results, because I report
only standardized coefﬁcients, which are by deﬁnition independent of previous
normalizations. Given the panel structure of the survey, two test scores per person
are available, allowing us to compute the average score of the person to reduce
measurement errors. Observations where the two scores had a difference of more
than 2 standard deviations were dropped from the analysis. For people with only one
valid test score this was taken to avoid losing too many observations.
Parental education in years was obtained by computing the average time spent in
school to achieve the reported education. Repeated years are, therefore, not
considered as schooling years, as one can argue that they do not provide additional
human capital. Note that the question on the achieved education level is asked twice
in the survey. Once it is asked in the roster questionnaire and once in the individual
questionnaires. I primarily took the information from the individual data and
completed it by the roster data when the individual data was missing.
The family log-consumption per capita was obtained out of a series of
information on consumption and normalized to the consumption per equivalent
9

Experimental regressions were performed including such variables in order to see if their exclusion
alters the results. I discuss these brieﬂy in the ‘‘Appendix E’’.

10
More details on Raven’s progressive matrices and its implementation in the MXFLS can be found in

adult following the methodology proposed by Rojas (2007), who provides estimates
for Mexico based on the subjective well-being approach.11 The wealth index was
obtained by taking the ﬁrst component of a principal component analysis performed
on several household assets and indicators of the housing conditions. A list of the
included indicators and their relative importance for the wealth index and its
possible relation with parental age are reported in the ‘‘Appendix C’’. The remaining
variables included in the study were constructed in a straightforward way according
to the standards in the literature and are reported with a short description in Table 1.
4.1.3 Sample size and sample selection
Initially 11,273 children and young adults aged between 12 and 25 years were
present in the database. From these only 8,155 individuals lived with both parents in
the same household. This is a necessary condition for this study, since otherwise no
cognitive ability scores of the parents are available. Proxies for other variables such
as education of absent family members would be available, but the cognitive scores
are not. Missing values in parents’ and children’s characteristics introduced another
loss of observations, reducing the sample to 4,266 observations. The large loss of
observations is not surprising considering the data requirements of the study and the
fact that they are survey data from an emerging country. These data are obviously
not as good as administrative data from European countries that were used in some
other studies on the topic. It could be argued that the loss of observations introduces
sample selection biases. Being fully aware of this fact, I try to show that the sample
used in this study produces some very comparable results to ﬁndings in the literature
and that the analysis is quite robust to changes in the sample. I also estimate the
benchmark model with larger samples, where I relax some data requirements. For
instance, excluding the channel of the father allows me to take into account the
numerous single-mother households and merging the effects of the father and the
mother, allows me to include every single-parent household. These larger sample
regressions are reported in ‘‘Appendix B’’.
4.2 Descriptive statistics
Let us now have a closer look at the data. Table 1 presents some univariate
descriptive statistics of the sample I use in the econometric models. The different
variables are divided into blocks corresponding to their role in the econometric
model. The main dependent variable is the education index previously introduced.
The index was constructed using the largest sample possible and not only the
observations used in the econometric estimation. Therefore, the average value is
slightly higher than 1. The same logic applies to the ability measures, which were
estimated using all available information.

11
Using the ofﬁcial Mexican equivalence scales based on CONEVAL (2008) gives essentially the same
results where only the third digit after the comma changes by at most two units. I prefer to follow Rojas

Descriptive statistics based on the sample of 4,266 observations
* Normalization was made with the full sample to use a maximum of information. The mean can deviate

The average and the standard deviation of the fathers’ years of education are
slightly higher than for the mothers. The proportion of indigenous parents is around
15 % which corresponds to the national average. The age of parents is measured in
years and fathers are slightly older than mothers. About one-quarter of parents grew
up in a city. The sample is strongly balanced between girls and boys and also
between families living in rural and urban areas. The indicator of rural areas is based
on the ofﬁcial deﬁnition of rural zones in Mexico and the place of living at the time
of the survey. As people might have lived in a different place during their education,
I use additional information on migration to correct the variable accordingly.12 Two
variables (Work02 and Work05) capture whether the children were working in 2002
and 2005, respectively. The proportion grows from around 17 to 25 %, reﬂecting the
aging of the cohort. The indicators on the number of children and teenagers allow us
to control for the composition of the households. On average, there is one child
below 12 years and about 1.6 teenagers present in a household. The set of
dichotomous program variables captures the beneﬁciary status of families for
different government programs. The proportions of beneﬁciaries are generally very
low, with the exception of Oportunidades and Procampo where the proportion is
above 10 %.
More interestingly than the averages of the variables are the relationships among
them. I now present some simple linear correlations between important variables.
They should provide a good impression of the data and outline some potentially
interesting phenomena. On the other hand, they should give us an impression of
comparability of the data with data used in other studies. I hope to reduce some
concerns regarding the sample selection issues and the deﬁnition of some main
variables by showing that the descriptive statistics are surprisingly comparable to
other studies in the literature.
A ﬁrst issue that one might discuss regarding the data is the use of Raven’s
progressive matrices test as a measure of cognitive ability or even IQ. In the sample,
the correlation of the ability measure with the one of the father is 0.363. This value
¨
is very close to the 0.347 and 0.38 estimated by Bjorklund et al. (2010) and Black
et al. (2009), respectively, both using more detailed IQ measures. The same
correlation with respect to the mother was found to be 0.387, which is slightly
higher than the father–son correlation. Considering only the two oldest siblings in a
family gives a siblings IQ-correlation of 0.506, which is again relatively close to the
¨
values reported by Bjorklund et al. (2010) who ﬁnd estimates between 0.473 and
0.510. Interestingly, and giving a ﬁrst evidence for assortative mating, the spousal
IQ-correlation is 0.400. The spousal education-correlation based on the years of
schooling is 0.646, which is even higher and supports the idea of an important role
of non-random spousal selection.

12
Unfortunately, it is not possible to use exclusively the information on the place of living when people
where at the age of education, because the variable is measured differently. I correct the variable rural
only in cases where people reported that they lived in a city during education and living in rural areas at
the time of the survey. The large majority of the individuals (around 90 %) never changed the place of
living and, therefore, the information of the place of living at the time of the survey is accurate for the

The reported correlations refer to the correlation between the years of education of the father and mother,
respectively, and the constructed education index. All correlations are computed for the working sample
used in this study

Regarding the simple educational attainment correlation between parents and
children, a very interesting pattern can be found when splitting the sample into age
groups. Table 2 presents the correlation between the education index used in this
study to proxy the educational attainment of children and their parents’ years of
education.
The correlations are substantially higher for the older age group as compared to
the younger group.13 Several possible explanations for this can be found. First, the
intergenerational transmission is likely to be a cumulative process, thus the older the
children become, the larger is the relationship between parental education and the
educational outcome of their children. Second, it could also be due to the precision
of the education attainment indicator used in this study. The older the children are,
the more values the indicator can take and, therefore, the correlations might be
estimated with more precision.14
The correlations for the older age group are slightly below the correlation of 0.55
estimated by de Hoyos et al. (2010) for children born between 1972 and 1981 in
Mexico. The likely reason for the difference is that de Hoyos et al. (2010) use older
individual with ﬁnished education. Looking at the difference from the younger to
the older age group, it is very likely to end up with similar values as de Hoyos et al.
(2010) if we could include older individuals.
Finally, Table 3 gives a comparison between the used and the full sample for the
main variables of interest. We can see that the differences are not statistically
signiﬁcant for father’s education and both parental ability measures. For consumption the difference is only signiﬁcant at the 10 % level. For other variables we
observe statistically different means, which is not very surprising with that many
observations. However, by looking at the column ‘Diff/SD’ we can see that the

Note that when computing the same correlation for younger children (say 7–11 years), the values are
even lower.
14

This argument is particularly true when considering even younger children at the age of primary
school. A previous version of this study included them. The decision to take them out of the study is
mainly due to this argument saying that the precision of the education attainment indicator is not

The ‘full sample’ includes all individuals in the age range of the study with non-missing values. The
column ‘Diff/SD’ refers to the difference between the two samples divided by the standard deviation of
the full sample

difference in terms of standard deviation of the variable never exceeds 0.2; thus they
are probably not as problematic as the statistical tests might lead us to think.
Overall, the data are certainly not perfect and do not attain the standards of highquality administrative data from some European studies. Nevertheless, the working
sample does seem to represent the full sample relatively well and permits us to carry
out the analysis.

5 Results
In Sect. 3 I introduced the two approaches to estimate the intergenerational
transmission in education. I now present the result following the same structure.
First I present the single regression approach where I estimate simple OLS and IV
models and then I move to the discussion of the simultaneous equations model.
5.1 Single regression approach
Table 4 presents the main regression results of the single-equation approach. The

the robust estimator to account for heteroskedasticity. In the model IV-1 I
instrument both parental education and the ability level of the child. For the models
IV-2 and IV-3 I instrument child’s ability and parental education separately. For
presentational reasons, I do not report some control variables such as the age and the
indigenous background of the parents and the indicator for rural areas. These
variables are not signiﬁcant. Additionally, I do not report the coefﬁcients of the
government program beneﬁts and the state ﬁxed effects to reduce the size of the
table.
Let us ﬁrst discuss the main coefﬁcients of the OLS regression, which are all
presented with standardized coefﬁcients. The ability of the child has a strong and
highly signiﬁcant effect on the schooling outcome. The direct effect of parental
education is also highly signiﬁcant and positive. The effect of the mother is larger
than the one of the father, which is in accordance with the literature. Both indicators
for the economic situation of the family display positive and signiﬁcant effects.
Note that this estimation does not directly allow us to conclude about the biological
channel, as we do not estimate the link between parental ability and child’s ability.
In order to see whether these OLS estimates are reliable, I move now to the
discussion of the IV estimates. First, we can see in the models IV-1 and IV-2 that the
coefﬁcients of the child’s ability does not change a lot as compared to the OLS
estimates. By looking at the endogeneity test based on Baum et al. (2007), we can
actually see that the variable is not endogenous and, therefore, instrumenting it is
not required. However, this test is only valid under the assumption of valid
instruments. To test the validity, I use the Hansen J statistic, which indicates that the
instruments are valid.15 Hence, for the ability measure of the child we do not seem
to have an endogeneity problem.16 As mentioned earlier, this might be due to a large
extent to the nature of the cognitive ability test, which is much less related to
education and cultural aspects than other ability measures.
Let us now turn to parental education. In the models IV-1 and IV-3 I instrument
parental education. Contrary to the previous results, we ﬁnd strong differences in the
coefﬁcients between the OLS estimation and the IV estimates. The coefﬁcient for
the father increases sharply while the coefﬁcients for the mother becomes much
smaller and insigniﬁcant.17 This is surprising and contrary to the ﬁndings in the
literature where the maternal education seems to matter more. It is, therefore,
important to understand where this result comes from. According to the Hansen
J-statistic the instruments are valid and the weak instrument test does not point to a
problem of weak instruments. In order to better understand the results, let us have a
closer look to the ﬁrst stage regressions presented in Table 5.
The Angrist-Pischke F-statistic is very large and suggests that the instruments are
strong (Angrist and Pischke 2009). Thus, in terms of the standard test for IV15

The null hypothesis of the test is that the instruments are valid.

16

In the regression IV-2 we could reject the null hypothesis at the 10 % level. I, therefore, performed the
endogeneity test on child’s ability only in the model IV-1, where we have clearly valid instruments. The
test shows also that child’s ability is not endogenous.
17
However, the two coefﬁcients are not signiﬁcantly different from each other (p value of 0.344 and
0.320 for IV-1 and IV-3, respectively). Hence, they are not contradicting the results found in the OLS

regression, these estimates seem to be valid. However, there is another problem
stemming from the underlying nature of the analysis, which goes beyond the
standard challenges of IV. Note that both father’s and mother’s education are
correlated with the cognitive ability measure and the place of living of either
parents. This is a direct result of assortative mating. It is clear that these correlations

are not causal. The consequence of this is that instrumented variables of the two
parents very strongly correlate. I computed the predicted education of the father and
the mother using the ﬁrst stage regression and ﬁnd a correlation of nearly 0.95,
while the actual parental education correlation is close to 0.65. Hence, in the main
regression, we have a strong problem of multicollinearity, which can explain why
the increase in the coefﬁcient related to the father is compensated by the coefﬁcient
related to the mother. This problem can also be highlighted with the additional
regressions IV-3b and IV-3c reported in Table 4. In these two regressions I excluded
one of the two parents and used only the instruments related to the parent included
in the regression. We can see that in both regressions the parameter of the parents is
highly signiﬁcant.
Overall, the single equation approach provided very coherent and expected
results. The education of the mother seems to matter slightly more than the
education of the father. The wealth index seems to matter more than the short-run
consumption and the cognitive ability of the child is also an important predictor of
the schooling outcome. Finally, the endogeneity tests performed on the IV estimates
did not allow us to conclude that we have a serious problem of endogeneity. I now
move to the simultaneous equations model which will allow us to learn more about
the different channels and their relative importance.
5.2 Simultaneous regression approach
Let me now turn to the results of the simultaneous equation model introduced in
Sect. 3.3. The possibility of estimating several channels simultaneously permits us
not only to avoid some biases due to omitted variables, but also to quantify these
biases by running regressions with some excluded variables on the same data. This
idea inﬂuenced the estimation strategy and made it straightforward to estimate some
simpliﬁed models alongside the complete model. This ﬁrst set of estimation results
is reported in Table 6. All models are estimated on exactly the same sample to avoid
confounding potential differences in the coefﬁcients due to changes in the model on
the one hand and due to changes in the sample on the other. Standardized

Model 1 is the complete model including ability, father’s and mother’s education
and the economic situation proxied by two variables. These main regressors were
accompanied by control variables such as gender, a rural area dummy, state ﬁxed
effects, social program dummies and child labor indicators which are not reported in
Table 6. The full estimation results of model 1, including the remaining equations of

Considering model 1, the estimation is quite precise and all coefﬁcients are
signiﬁcant at the 1 %-level. The coefﬁcient related to the child’s ability measure
attains with 0.218 the highest value. Both father’s and mother’s education have a
highly signiﬁcant and positive effect. The size of the coefﬁcient for the mother is
substantially higher than the one for the father. With respect to the economic
variables we can also observe a signiﬁcant difference between the two. The effect of
the wealth index is substantially higher than the one of consumption. This ﬁnding is
coherent with the ﬁndings by Carneiro and Heckman (2002) who argue that the long
run economic environment matters more than short-term credit constraints. When
considering both economic effects, we see that the economic situation has the
largest direct intergenerational effect on the schooling outcome of the child. In
general, these results are relatively close to what was found in the OLS regression in
Table 4.
Model 1 is estimated on a sample of 4,266 individuals and could potentially
suffer from a sample selection bias. As discussed in the data section, I also estimate
the full model relaxing some requirements on the data. In a ﬁrst step, I include
single mother households by dropping the channel of the father increasing the
sample size to 6,547 individuals. In a second step, I include all households where
data are available on either of the parents and taking the maximum value when both
are available. This allows us to include 143 additional individuals, because in model
1 some were dropped just because of one missing parental characteristic. These
larger sample estimates are reported in Table 11 in the ‘‘Appendix B’’. The general
pattern is very encouraging, as almost no changes in the main regression are
observed. Most coefﬁcients increase slightly, but remain at very similar levels. The
relative importance of the effects remains unchanged. Overall, these additional
regressions give some support on the validity of model 1 since the results hold even
when changing the sample a lot. In what follows, I take model 1 as the benchmark
model, as it is the only one allowing us to control for all different channels.
5.2.1 Direct versus indirect effects
Let us now return to the discussion of model 1 from Table 6. An interesting feature
of simultaneous equation models is that they enable us to compute direct and
indirect effects. For example, it is clear that parental education does not only affect
the schooling outcome through the direct effect discussed before, but also through
the economic situation of the family. Figure 4 shows the direct and indirect effects
based on the results of model 1, fully reported in Table 11. As in the discussion
before, one can easily see that the ability measure of the child has the largest direct
effect (black bars). The wealth index has the second largest direct effect, followed
by the mother’s education. However, the total effect of mother’s education is larger
than the total effect of the wealth index. This is due to the fact that besides the direct
effect we also have an indirect effect of maternal education through both economic
indicators. The same is true for the father, where the relative importance of the
indirect effect is even bigger. Nevertheless, the total effect of father’s education

Finally, parental ability has no direct effect but only indirect effects through the
genetic transmission and the other two channels. The total effects attain values of
about 0.13 for the mother and 0.10 for the father.
5.2.2 Biases when neglecting channels
Models 2–5 in Table 6 only include one of the four possible channels assuming the
others to have no impact. The last model includes the often available data on the
education of parents and the economic situation but not the ability measures. We can
notice that the one-covariate models always give strongly upward biased estimators
of the coefﬁcients, when comparing them to the benchmark model in the ﬁrst
column. Not surprisingly, the bias in relative terms is lower for the important
channels, namely ability and the wealth index, where the new coefﬁcient is roughly
1.5 times higher than in model 1. The upward bias of parental education is much
more important, since the coefﬁcient attains 2–3 times higher values for mother’s and
father’s education, respectively. However, the biases become much smaller when all
but the ability measure are included. Due to missing information of ability measures
in most of the surveys, this setting corresponds to the best we can normally do. The
coefﬁcients are about 20 % higher than that in the benchmark model, which is
considerably less than in models 2–5. More importantly, the relative importance of
the coefﬁcients is very similar in model 6 as compared to model 1.
5.2.3 Regression by age groups
Based on the descriptive ﬁndings presented in Table 2 of increasing intergenerational education correlations with age, a second set of estimation results is
presented in Table 7. Model 1 is estimated for different age groups and additionally

correspond to the age when people are normally in secondary (including high
school) and tertiary education.
As for the simple correlation, I ﬁnd differences between the two age groups. In
general, the coefﬁcients are slightly higher for the older group. A sharp increase is
observed for the effect of mother’s education. The model ﬁt also increases
substantially from the younger the older age group. As for the simple correlations
presented before, there are several possible explanations. First, it could be argued
that this is due to a more precise measure of the dependent variable for the older age
group. The second explanation is that the inequalities in education are a cumulative
process and that the relative importance of the channels can evolve with the age of
the child. Most likely both phenomena are present in these results. The fact that all
indicators become more important supports the idea that the measurement is more
precise for the older group. However, the fact that not all explanatory variables
increase their effect in the same way points to something beyond this argument. In
particular, the coefﬁcient of the mother’s education increases substantially more
than that of the others. Hence, we might have reasons to believe that the impact of
the mother becomes more important with age. This could be due to the role of the
mother in pushing the child to continue at school. Of course, additional research is
required to conﬁrm this conclusion, because the results could also be driven by the
larger precision of the dependent variable.
5.2.4 Regression by gender
Given that mother’s and father’s education have different effects, it might be
interesting to see whether the effects are also different for boys and girls. The last
two columns in table 7 present model 1 for girls and boys, respectively. We can see
that the two economic indicators have slightly higher coefﬁcients for boys while the
child’s ability seems to matter a bit more for girls. The education of the father is

somewhat more important for boys. A large difference can be observed for the role
of mother’s education, which has an almost twice as large effect for girls as
compared to boys. The exact reasons for this difference are beyond the scope of this
analysis, but it might be a very interesting question for future research.

6 Conclusion
The present study tries to contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms
generating the high intergenerational education correlations observed all over the
world and especially in Latin American countries. A particularly important issue is
to distinguish the different channels of transmission outlined by the literature over
the past years. Using very rich data from Mexico, a simultaneous equations model
of the educational transmission can be estimated, allowing me to distinguish
between the different channels: the biological transmission of ability, transmission
through the economic situation and the education-to-education channel. Additional
channels such as health or non-cognitive abilities are not considered in this study.
Unfortunately, the data and especially the unavailability of retrospective information on health did not allow me to include such channels. However, these channels
might be important as they might upward bias the importance of the included
channels, particularly the education-to-education channel. This caveat must be kept
in mind when discussing the results.
The results suggest that the economic situation of the family is the most
important direct intergenerational channel, which has an even larger effect than the
ability of the child when considering the effects of both economic indicators
together. I distinguish between consumption as a proxy of the current economic
situation and a wealth index to capture the long-term economic situation in the
analysis. I ﬁnd a larger effect of the wealth index, which is in accordance with
ﬁndings in the literature. Parental education matters to explain children’s schooling
but not in a very strong way as the intergenerational correlation might lead us to
expect. The mother’s education directly and signiﬁcantly inﬂuences the schooling
outcome of children. The education of the fathers also affects the schooling outcome
directly and has additionally a strong indirect effect through the economic situation
of the family.
The ﬁnding that the economic situation plays an important role suggests that the
current situation is likely not to be efﬁcient. This is due to the non-optimal
investment in education of the poorer children and, therefore, they cannot exploit
their potential. On the other hand, the ﬁnding is encouraging in the sense that the
low educational mobility does not seem to be a fatality. The strong inﬂuence of the
economic situation of the parent can be targeted by public policies. In this respect,
cash transfer programs (conditional or not) might help us to increase social mobility
as they allow poorer families to invest more in education. Over the recent years
many programs were implemented and it is, therefore, possible that they already
generate beneﬁcial effects in terms of educational mobility.
In addition to the main results I also performed the same analysis on sub-samples.

First, the intergenerational links are higher for older children. All coefﬁcients
increase with the age group and particularly the education of the mother becomes
much more important with age. This result might suggest that the intergenerational
links are following a cumulative process, suggesting that even at higher ages policy
interventions can be useful. However, the differences found for the different age
groups could also be due to the more precise measure of the educational attainment
for the older age group. Additional research is required to distinguish the two
possible explanations found in this study.
Second, I ﬁnd differences in the relative importance of transmission channels
between girls and boys. The economic situation of the family matters slightly more
for boys while the ability of the child is somewhat more important for girls. The
biggest gender difference is found for maternal education. The effect of maternal
education is almost twice as high for girls as compared to boys.
The analysis demonstrates that estimates ignoring important alternative channels
of transmission tend to overestimate the effects of the analyzed variables.
Remaining unobserved channels such as personality traits could upward bias my
results to a certain extent. Nevertheless, the used data does not allow me to consider
additional channels as they would imply a large drop in the sample sizes and
increase the problem of a non-random sample. Finally, the analysis should be seen
as a piece among others in the recent literature aiming at understanding the
mechanisms of educational mobility. For future research I see mainly three
interesting directions. First, it would be useful to conduct similar analyses for other
countries with low educational mobility to see whether the ﬁndings hold also
outside the Mexican context. Second, the results suggest that cash transfer programs
could potentially help us to increase educational mobility. Future research could
look at this effect and try to ﬁnd out more about the most effective speciﬁcities of
such programs. Third, while most effects were relatively stable across sub-samples,
the effect of maternal education changes substantially with age and gender of the
child. It would, therefore, be interesting to further investigate the role of the mother
in the intergenerational transmission of education.

Appendix A: The education index: distribution and relevance
The goal of this appendix is to show that the education index used in the study is a

additional information on the Mexican education system. I start by discussing how
an educational delay is related to the ﬁnal level of education.
Relevance of the education index
As outlined in Sect. 4.1.1, it is assumed that the education index is related to the
years of education once the individual leaves school. That is, a delay in school at an
early age should be translated in getting less education. School delay at early ages
can arise from late entry to the educational system or repeating grades. In Table 8 I
present a simple OLS regression of the years of education on the number of grade
repetitions in primary school and the years of delay to start school. The data come
from the same survey as the main analysis of the paper, but here I use only people
no longer attending school.
We can see that already a late entry of 1 year is related to a decrease of total
schooling of about 1 year, while students entering the system 2–4 years later have
on average between 3 and 4 years less years of education in the end. Grade
repetition has also a negative effect on total schooling, where 1 repetition is broadly
related with one year less of schooling. It is important to notice that I do not claim
that this regression identiﬁes causal effects, which is actually not needed to show the
utility of the chosen educational index.
The Mexican education system
The Mexican education system is characterized by 6 years of primary education,
followed by 6 years of secondary education. Secondary education is divided in 3
years of lower secondary education (secundaria) and 3 years of upper secondary

Let me highlight some interesting results I did not discuss in the main body of the
paper. The education production function estimates are very similar for the mother
and the father. The cognitive ability and the place of living at the age of 12 years
have the large positive and the age and the indigenous background negative effects.
For both the long- and the short-run economic situation the fact of being indigenous
has a negative impact, even when controlling for education.

The dependent variable for the structural equation is reported in parenthesis in the title of each panel. The
coefﬁcients are reported in the ﬁrst column and the standard errors in the second for each model. All
coefﬁcients are standardized, meaning that for continuous regressors the coefﬁcients measure how many
standard deviations the dependent variable changes when the regressor changes one standard deviation
and for dichotomous variables when the variables turn from zero to one. Signiﬁcance levels *** 1 %, **

The second and third regressions are based on enlarged samples. The ﬁrst
enlarged sample includes also the single-mother households and excludes as a
consequence the channel of the father. The second enlarged sample considers
always the highest values of either the mother or the father. As already mentioned in
the main text, the results do not change a lot despite the substantial change in the
sample size.
The role of mother’s ability increases in the ability equation when not controlling
for the ability level of the father. This is due to the correlation among the IQ of both
parents. The effect of consumption is slightly higher in the large sample regressions,
but remains always considerably smaller than the effect of the wealth index. When
merging the education of the two parents, the combined effect is somewhat larger
than the effect of the mother in the main regression, but does not attain the sum of
the two parental coefﬁcients. The relatively stable results give additional credibility
to the results on the main sample used in the study.

Appendix C: Discussion of the wealth index
In the analysis, I use a wealth index to approximate the long run economic situation
of the household. In this appendix, I ﬁrst present the way it was constructed and then
I discuss the concern that such a wealth index could actually capture an age effect of
the parents.
Construction of the wealth index
Let me ﬁrst discuss how the wealth index is constructed. I use the ﬁrst component of
a principal component analysis performed on various indicators. This allows me to
reduce the dimensions and to have a single indicator. In this appendix, I present the
descriptive statistics of the indicator variables and the composition of the used
wealth indicator. Table 12 displays the mean of each variable and its relative
contribution to the wealth index.

From these ﬁgures, we see that the contribution substantially varies across
indicators and therefore a simple average of the indicator variable would probably
not well describe wealth. Among the most important contributors, we ﬁnd the clean
cooking energy, the clean garbage evacuation, the availability of a phone and the
indicator for a clean ﬂoor. Rather of minor importance are the indicators for having
a kitchen in the household and whether the household has access to electricity. The
reason for these low contribution levels is the almost full coverage among the
Mexican population and the resulting small variance in these variables.

The main results of the study show that the long run economic situation proxied by
the wealth index is a main channel of transmission from one generation to the next.
A potential concern with this variable stems from the fact that household assets
could be directly linked to the age of the parents. If older parents have
systematically more of these goods and therefore a higher wealth index, then we
might actually capture an age effect rather than an effect of the economic channel.
In the regressions, I control for the parental age to deal with this concern.
Nevertheless, a closer look at the relationship between the wealth index and parental
age can help us to reduce the concerns even more.
Figure 5 displays the non-parametric regression of degree 1 of the standardized
wealth index (left axis) as a function of average parental age (left graph) and the
child–parents age differential (right graph). The dashed line in each graph is a
density estimation of the average parental age and the child–parents age differential,
respectively.
We can observe that the average of the wealth index is slightly below 0 for the
youngest parents. However, the density of such young parents is rather small. For
the remaining part of the parental age distribution the average is very close to zero.
This is also true in the right graph where the variable on the x-axis is the age
differential between parents and the child. The estimator of the mean is very close to
zero for all values of the age differential.

In general, we cannot observe a strong relationship between the wealth index and
the age of the parents. Thus, it is unlikely that the wealth index actually captures an
age effect of the parents.

Appendix D: Identiﬁcation of the simultaneous equations model
In this appendix, I discuss the identiﬁcation of the model presented in Eqs. (1)–(6)
in the main body of the article. To simplify the notation, the endogenous left-hand
side variables of the Eqs. (1)–(6) can be combined in the matrix Y and all
exogenous variables in matrix X, which includes all exogenous variables in white
boxes in Fig. 2. This allows us to rewrite the model in the standard simultaneous
equation model (SEM) notation:
Y ¼ B Y þ AX þ n

ð 7Þ

where n is a vector containing the error terms of the equations, B is a zero-diagonal
coefﬁcient matrix for the endogenous variables and A is the coefﬁcient matrix for
the exogenous variables. Let me further deﬁne U to be covariance matrix of X and
W to be the covariance matrix of the disturbance terms n. We impose a condition
that the exogenous variables X are uncorrelated with the error terms in n. The model
described before, has the following matrix B and I assume the following covariance

This model has a lower triangular matrix B which greatly simpliﬁes its identiﬁcation. However, it is not a recursive model because I do not assume W to be diagonal.20 While a recursive model would be automatically identiﬁed, the conditions
for this model are somewhat more complicated. To discuss the identiﬁcation of the
model I follow Heuchenne (1997) and Paxton et al. (2011). Heuchenne (1997)
proposes a sufﬁcient rule for identiﬁcation based on B and W exclusively. He

The covariance matrix is symmetric. For presentational purpose, I only present the upper triangular
version.

I only assume uncorrelated error terms for the ability transmission Eq. (1) and the child’s education
Eq. (6). This last assumption is conﬁrmed by the IV estimates I will present in Sect. 5.1. Note, however,

The number (in bold) on the diagonal indicate how many excluded parameters are
above in the same column and to the left of the same row. For instance, the value of
3 in the third row is obtained by counting the two zero values in the third row left to
the diagonal and the zero value in the third column above the diagonal. Heuchenne
(1997) shows that equation k is identiﬁed whenever the corresponding value on the
diagonal is bigger or equal to ðk À 1). We can see that all but Eqs. (4) and (5) satisfy
this sufﬁcient condition. Hence, we can conclude that all but the economic situation
equations are identiﬁed based on the lower triangular form of B and the structure of
W.
To verify if also Eqs. (4) and (5) are identiﬁed, we have to use conditions that are
not only based on B but also on A, the coefﬁcient matrix of the exogenous variables.
All equations in the model pass the order condition saying that an equation is
identiﬁed if the number of excluded exogenous variables is equal or greater than the
number of endogenous variables in that equation minus one (Paxton et al. 2011).
The order condition is, however, only a sufﬁcient condition. A stronger necessary
condition is the equivalent structures approach, which is an algebraic identiﬁcation
technique (Paxton et al. 2011). For this, let us rewrite Eq. (7) by regrouping all
parameters related to the vector Y on the left-hand side.
BY ¼ AX þ n

ð10Þ

By doing so, matrix B has a unit diagonal and all off-diagonal elements change the
sign. This change of notation does not change the system but is more convenient for
the computation of the equivalent structures approach. Let us now deﬁne a general
matrix M and deﬁne the following set of equations:
MA ¼ A

MB ¼ B

M RM 0 ¼ R

ð11Þ

The model is fully identiﬁed if the only solution to this system obtained by using the
restrictions on A, B and W is the identity matrix (M ¼ I). Let us start with the

Finally, we have six equations with two unknown, which makes it very easy to
determine the two remaining elements of M. For instance, using the ﬁrst equation
we can deﬁne m65 ¼ À cc3 m64 and plug this into the second row to ﬁnd that
11
m64 ¼ m65 ¼ 0.
Note that using the restrinctions on A and B allows us to solve the whole matrix
M and we ﬁnd M ¼ I. The full model is therefore identiﬁed.

Appendix E: Regressions with additional dimensions
The results in the main body of the article include only three channels. However,
there might be other important channels affecting the intergenerational transmission
of education. For instance, health, non-cognitive abilities or personality traits could
be transmitted from one generation to the next and affect education.
Unfortunately, the data used in this study do not allow to include such channels.
There are two main reasons why I cannot include these channels in the analysis.
First, including indicators on personality traits would substantially reduce the
sample size and, therefore, increase the risk of sample selection biases. Second, for
the health dimensions, no retrospective information about the health status of
parents is provided. Hence, we could observe the health status of parents at the time
of the survey, but not at the relevant time when children were attending school.
In this appendix, I present experimental regressions to show what would happen,
if despite the problems we would try to include these channels. Table 13 displays
the OLS regression reported in Table 4 in the main body of the text and an
augmented version, where I include some parental health and behavioral variables.
The mental health indicator is based on 18 questions about the emotional
situation of individuals and combined through a factor analysis. A higher value
indicates more emotional problems. Parental height can have an inﬂuence as it

Model A is the same model as reported in Table 4 as OLS. Model B includes additional explanatory
variables and Model C uses the variables of Model A and the sample of Model B. All regressions include
also additional control variables such as mother’s and father’s age and indigenous background, an
indicator for rural areas (none of these is signiﬁcant). Additionally state ﬁxed effects and control variables
of government aid programs are included but not reported. Robust standard errors are reported
a


2013), which in turn affect the schooling outcome (Behrman and Rosenzweig 2004;
Black et al. 2007). In respect to personality traits and behaviors, I include a
dichotomous variables on the self-reported self conﬁdence, on the importance of
respecting rules and whether at least one of the parents aims at planning their
ﬁnancial situations more than just a couple of days ahead.
The results of the table underline the discussed difﬁculties. First, we can observe
a sharp drop in the sample size, which substantially increases the problem of a nonrandom sample. Second, the coefﬁcients of the newly added variables are mostly not
signiﬁcant. This can be due to the quality of the indicators themselves, but also to
the fact that we do not observe the values for the relevant period. For instance, the
mental health today is much less relevant than the mental health when the child was
at school. Finally, the parameters of main interest for the study are only very little
affected by the inclusion of these variables. When comparing to the baseline model
estimated on the same sample as the augmented model, we can see only very little
variation. Of course, this is also due to the poor explanatory power of the included
variables.
