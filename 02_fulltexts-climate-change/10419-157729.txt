1 Introduction
The bottleneck of modern sorting systems is no longer
found in the ﬁeld of the physical distributor (sorter). The
ﬂuidic characteristic optimization of the supporting element (carrier) designs for discretely working sorter systems, in the CEP industry (courier, express, postal
services), now allows sorting speeds up to 3.5 m/s [1]. The

resulting disadvantage, the enlargement of the dropping
parable and associated enlargement of the ‘‘unloading
window’’, these days can be compensated for the most part
by technical control procedures [2–4]. One example is the
consideration of the unloading window at the rotary sorter.
A mathematical solution has been compiled for this by
Schmidt [5].
This paper proposes improved input stages for sorter
systems that operate with non-tacted, random input.
Application of modern loading and unloading strategies
also has led to high unloading or sorting performance [6,
7]. It can therefore be said that the discrete supplying
elements used today have achieved the physical–technical
limits. Efﬁciency considerations, in particular maximization of throughput, do not cease to be in the centre of
research interest and are primarily focused on system
optimization as a whole [8]. The solution presented in this
manuscript approaches the problem on machine level
instead. Only a fundamentally new development in this
area would allow another signiﬁcant increase in output.
Nevertheless, the ﬁeld of feed systems and the conveyer
belt feeding systems (single-stage-feeder) has been out of
focus for a long time due to the concentration on developing the physical distributor. Yet recently the infeed line
has gained attention again [9]. Performance studies of
infeed lines at the rotary sorter with a proposal of
improvements have been presented in [10]. However,
impediment at sub-optimal feeder systems, which may lead
to a considerable reduction of input performance and thus
reduce the overall performance of otherwise optimized
discrete and continuous sorter systems [11], has rarely been
discussed in the literature.
On the one hand, impediment can be caused by the
presence of a self-loaded general cargo unit that has not yet
left the input area in the moment when the next general

cargo unit is ready to be placed on the conveyer belt. This
phenomenon is called self-impediment. On the other hand,
at subsequent input stations of a multistage feeder system,
impediment may and usually will be caused by traversing
general cargo from previous input stations. This article is
largely focused on the latter type of impediment, mutual
impediment (see Sect. 2).
A new feeding system that substantially reduces mutual
impediment was conceived, simulated and validated with
the help of a prototype in [12]: the divided conveyer belt
feeder. A sequence of conveyer belts with sequentially
increasing speeds, in combination with spatially variable
input (denoted variable input in the following), guarantees
that there is always sufﬁcient vacant space at subsequent
input stations such that another general cargo unit can be
loaded. The divided conveyer belt with variable input is
discussed in Sect. 3.
In Sect. 4, a rigorous mathematical treatment of the
divided conveyer belt is given that conﬁrms and reproduces
results obtained from experiment. Additionally, we argue
that the divided conveyer belt with variable input theoretically eliminates the problem of mutual impediment
completely.

illustration).

3 The divided conveyer belt
2 Mutual impediment
Mutual impediment is caused by existing general cargo on
a conveyer belt feeding system (single-stage feeder) or on a
physical distributor (blocked carrier on the sorter). It can
originate from input on a collecting conveyer belt feed as
well as from an input on an obliquely located feeding belt.
This form of impediment to input operators leads to a
noticeable decline in the overall performance in the feed
system. Xiaoguang and Tsutsumi [11] analysed a similar
impediment in a simulation of a multistage feeder model.
They showed that with each additional feeder the onloading performance at the additional feeder declines
compared with the previous feeder. The reduction of the
efﬁciency is shown in Fig. 1. The probability of occurrence
of mutual impediment is increasing with the number of
single-stage feeders [11].
Mutual impediment can only be avoided if usable and
sufﬁciently large vacant space on the single-stage feeder or
a free support element (e.g. cross belt, carrier) is available
at all times.
An exception concerning the mutual impediment is the
direct input on the physical distributor. Here, the input
operator has the possibility of ‘‘variable’’ input. In principle,
the operator can always use the support element (carrier)
before or after the occupied support element [11, 12].
In contrast to mutual impediment, self-impediment is
caused by self-loaded general cargo units, which block

To deﬁne the system limits and to clarify the project contents, Arnold [13] provides an initial distinction (Fig. 3).
The divided conveyer belt, as a feeder, acts only within the
identiﬁcation and supplying (feeding) area (1), while the
physical distributor, clearly separated from area (1), is not
included within the scope of this research. Similarly, the
construction form and operating form of the physical distributor are not decisive factors. Therefore, following the
VDI guideline 3619, the feed system brought to the centre
of attention for this investigation is divided into its functions: input, identiﬁcation and feeding.
The input into a distribution system using obliquely
located feeding belts (single-stage feeder) generates, after a
short machine operation time, mutual impediment (see also
[11]).
Therefore, it was necessary to design a new feeder
system, the divided conveyer belt feeder. The basic principle is depicted in Fig. 4. Every conveyer belt is accelerated compared with its predecessor by a factor a. Now,
on the transition from one conveyer belt to the following
faster one, a general cargo unit is accelerated relative to the
units following behind. Thus, new vacant spaces are
automatically generated between each general cargo unit,
without enforcing explicit constraints on the operators that
serve the input stations. The prototype system arranged up
to four conveyer belts, connected in series, each having its

Fig. 2 a Mutual impediment
occurs, when general cargo
(GC) from a preceding input
station blocks the input area at
the end of handling a new
general cargo unit. b Selfimpediment occurs if selfloaded general cargo blocks the
input area

Several preparations and precautions have been taken to
ensure realistic and ergonomically optimal input operations
in the experimental validation procedure. The methods–
time measurement (MTM) study provided a basis for
designing the workplaces and determining the expected

execution time for the various coding and input procedures
(see Table 1). To carry out a comprehensive ergonomic
design of a workplace, the psychological points of view
were considered in addition to the anatomical and physiological factors. The basic conditions of the workplace and
the working environment (light, noise, vibration and shock,
climate, etc.), as well as the manual loading capacity, were
adapted as much as possible to human needs. Care was
taken that constantly recurring sequences of motion were
supported by the speciﬁc kind of the construction for
individual workplaces. To guarantee the most natural
postures and motion sequences in the workplace design, the
body mass of the input staff was taken into consideration.
The aim was to ensure that the results of the attempt could
not be falsiﬁed by insufﬁcient ergonomic boundary conditions [14].
First, a series of experiments was carried out for all
coding procedures and input procedures, to determine
learning and fatigue curves. The tests for validation of the
mutual impediment did not start until it was ensured that
the input operator had reached maximum efﬁciency.
External inﬂuence, which falsiﬁes the test result, was
therefore eliminated as much as possible.
Numerical and experimental evidence for the decline of
input performance due to mutual impediment is summarized in Figs. 6 and 7. The possible input performance
obtained from simulation with AutoMod decreases. This is
in agreement with [11]. Note that it is yet difﬁcult to
compare numbers as the simulated systems were rather
different. However, experiments with the divided conveyer
belt have shown that reality is even worse. As the operator
causes chaotic general cargo input (no rhythm), there are

Fig. 4 Basic principle of the divided conveyer belt feeding system
with variable width bE of input area. Conveyer 2 is accelerated
compared with conveyer 1 by a factor a. General cargo on conveyer 2

moves faster than general cargo on conveyer 1, and thus on transition
from conveyer 1–2, additional vacant space is generated between each
general cargo unit

not enough ‘‘ideal’’ gaps, i.e. not enough vacant space with
sufﬁcient width is generated. As a result, the entire ‘‘real’’
input performance dropped, in fact, to zero at place 4 when
conveyer 4 worked with 0.7 m/s and at place 3 when
conveyer 4 worked with 0.5 m/s (See Fig. 6).
An even more pronounced decline of input performance
at position 2 is shown in Fig. 7. Here, two input positions
were observed after they entered a ‘‘steady state’’. Then,
the operator at position 1 gradually increased the input
frequency. It is clearly apparent that the short-time increase
in input performance at position 1 reduced the input performance at position 2 by almost 50 % due to lack of
usable gaps. As a result, the entire input performance was
reduced. Again, a simulation carried out simultaneously
conﬁrmed the experimental results. This clearly indicates
that the origin of mutual impediment is linked to fast and
chaotic cargo input.

Even though the initially chosen approach for removing
the phenomenon with a divided conveyer belt feed (patent
DE 100 51 932 A) seemed promising (cf. [12]), it turned
out that as long as the input was spatially restricted a slight
reduction of the overall performance still occurred. As a
result of this insight, the variability of the input moved to
the centre of attention. The probabilistic model described
in the next section serves, in addition to practical experiment, as a tool to investigate the interplay between the
divided conveyer belt as such and the variability of input.
Results of experiments on the divided conveyer belt
prototype system and simulation of a standard conveyer
belt feeding system are listed in Table 2. The advantage of
variable input over ﬁxed input position (this corresponds to
the case where bE ¼ lmin in Sect. 4) can clearly be seen.
Input is denoted variable, or spatially variable, if the
operator is ﬂexible in his choice of where to place the
general cargo unit within the input area. Obviously, input
Table 2 Comparison of the
waiting (or idle) time tw for a
standard conveyer belt feeding
system (obtained from
simulation with AutoMod) and
the experimental results of the
divided conveyer belt feeding
system with ﬁxed and variable
input position [16]

can only be variable if the width of the input area is sufﬁciently much larger than the length of a general cargo
unit.
To compute the efﬁciency (the value 1 corresponds to no
idle time), the MTM value tMTM for the handling time was
taken as the optimal handling time. The reduced value for
tMTM had to be applied, because a modiﬁed experimental
design of the workplace simpliﬁed the processing procedure. While for the standard conveyer belt system the idle
time steadily increases, it decreases steadily for the divided
conveyer belt with ﬁxed input and almost vanishes completely if input is variable. The very high idle time at input
position 2 is signiﬁcant for a ‘‘ﬁxed’’ input position. The
reason for this is based on the origin of the vacant space,
which is relatively narrow at this point in time. This makes
further general cargo input difﬁcult. The approach to
realizing a bigger speed step at this point must be rejected
on account of the subsequent speed steps. Although this
table shows some relict of idle time at position 2—there is
still a minimal amount of mutual impediment—the system
performance does almost entirely depend on the handling
time only.

4 Theoretical input performance
The following considers the new system in terms of a
probabilistic model. Assuming a constant width of the
general cargo units the optimal solution for the acceleration
factor a that permits the maximum probability of input
(loading) will be given. While the optimal choice of a
ensures that another general cargo unit can always be
loaded at the subsequent input station, it is the width of the
input area that needs to be suitably adjusted to maximize

area, no idle times occur (Sect. 4.2). While it is not too
difﬁcult to see that with enough spatial variability the
divided conveyer belt eliminates mutual impediment, it is
instructive to investigate numbers in detail, thus obtaining
a quantiﬁcation of the beneﬁt (Sect. 4.3). Furthermore, in
some cases compromises might be in order that prevent
from providing total spatial variability. Then, our approach
may be helpful in ﬁnding an optimal solution under spatially restricted conditions.
4.1 The model
In the following investigation, the basic structure of the
model shall mostly be restricted to the case of two conveyer belts, each having their own input area. With the ﬁrst
conveyer belt working at speed v1 , the second conveyer
belt is accelerated compared with the ﬁrst by a factor a.
Imposed by technical conditions, the speed v2 , of the second conveyer shall be limited by vmax , i.e.
vmax ! v2 ¼ av1 :
Three different lengths:
•
•
•

the constant width of general cargo lGC ,
the constant minimum necessary handling width lmin
and
the width bE , of the input area equal at both stations,

are restricted and related to each other by
bE ! lmin [ lGC [ 0:
While, in principle, lGC and lmin may be different for each
individual general cargo unit and thus represent random
variables, both shall be assumed constant for simplicity. The
handling times at station 1 and 2, denoted T1 and T2 ,
respectively, are treated as random variables following, for
example, an equal or suitable normal distribution. An illustration of the basic structure is shown in Fig. 4.
For concretion and comparison, three speciﬁc models
that differ only in the width of the input area shall be
considered explicitly:
•
•
•

Model 1: bE1 ¼ lmin .
Model 2: bE2 ¼ 2lmin .
Model 3: bE3 ¼ 3lmin .

Note that the increased input areas in models 2 and 3
permit spatially variable input.
In a real-world application, the minimum necessary
handling width lmin is always larger than lGC by a small
amount. To avoid unnecessary subtleties, lmin shall be
chosen as the central length of importance in our discussion. The minimum vacant space generated on the transition from one conveyer to the next is

Thus, for a ! 2, the new generated vacant space is
always sufﬁciently large to accept another general cargo
unit.
Generally, the allocation of vacant space between two

The condition T1 lmin =v1 signals self-impediment (see
Fig. 2b) that occurs if a self-loaded general cargo unit still
blocks the input area at the end of handling the following
general cargo unit. If the speed of conveyer 1 is too low or,
put in another way, the operator at station 1 acts to fast, the
preceding general cargo unit has not had enough time to
leave the input area. Assuming that the current general
cargo unit then will be placed immediately after the preceding one, there will be effectively no vacant space left
between the two units.
Let P1 ðT1 Þ be the probability density function of handling times at station 1. Then, the probability

stations), provided P1 ðT1 Þ % P2 ðT2 Þ, i.e. the distributions

is always large enough to accept another general cargo unit
if a ! 2.
Technically, there is always an upper limit vmax to the
speed of conveyers. The speed of the ﬁrst conveyer much
be chosen sufﬁciently small, such that the speed of the
subsequent conveyer(s) does not exceed this maximum.
But if self-impediment is to be avoided, the speed of the
ﬁrst conveyer cannot be chosen arbitrarily small. Self-impediment can be completely avoided only if the minimum
possible handling time at station 1, T1;min , is always larger
than lmin =v1 . This puts another constraint on the speed v1 of
conveyer 1. Thus, in summary, if it is the primary goal to
always provide sufﬁcient vacant space at station 2 for
another general cargo unit to be supplied, and the secondary goal to avoid self-impediment at station 1, the
following optimal solution arises:

It is, in fact, straightforward to generalize this discussion
to a system of N conveyer belts with individual speeds vi ,
each being accelerated with respect to its predecessor by a

is to ensure that the maximum conveyer belt speed technically possible is not exceeded, i.e. vN vmax . The random
variable Gin , which describes the allocation of vacant space

The general treatment of Gout must take into account the

mixing of different random input sequences for i ! 2.
Ideally, this can be described by a convolution of handling
time distributions. Due to mutual impediment, however,
the exact treatment is a bit more involved and shall be
subject to a future publication.
In principle, the factors ai can take different values at
each conveyer, and ﬁne tuning can lead to optimized performance in real applications. Following along the line of
the above discussion, however, we argue that the theoretically optimal solution is

that at each conveyer i ! 2, there will be sufﬁcient new
vacant space,
that the last conveyer obeys the speed limit imposed by
technical conditions, and
that no self-impediment occurs, in particular, at station
1.

In the remaining parts of this section, it shall be assumed
that no self-impediment occurs at the input stations.
4.2 Maximum idle time
Idle times at station 2 can arise by blocked input areas at
the handling moment. The presence of general cargo from
station 1 prevents the input of another general cargo unit at
station 2. Of particular interest is the maximum idle time
(or waiting time) wmax . Impediment, i.e. blocking caused
by the general cargo unit from station 1, begins when there
is not enough space left within the input area in front of the
blocking general cargo unit (Fig. 8a). Putting the origin to
the edge of the input area where general cargo units enter,
impediment thus begins when the front edge of the general
cargo unit is at
x1 ¼ bE À lmin ¼ ðkE À 1Þlmin ;

ð4Þ

where the ratio kE ¼ bE =lmin ! 1 has been introduced for
convenience. Impediment ends when there eventually
occurs enough space within the input area behind the
blocking general cargo unit (Fig. 8b). This is the case when
the front edge of the blocking unit is at
x2 ¼ lmin þ lGC ¼ ð1 þ kGC Þlmin ;

ð5Þ

with the ratio kGC ¼ lGC =lmin \1. The maximum idle time
arises when the general cargo unit from station 1 has just
begun to block. Then, the maximum distance it has to
traverse to end impediment is ðx2 À x1 Þ. But this maximum

time it takes to traverse it depends on the speed of conveyer
belt 2. Under the condition that a ! 2; there is always
enough space behind a general cargo unit, and we do not
need to consider the presence of more than one blocking
general cargo unit. Then, explicitly, the maximum idle time

For kE [ 2 þ kGC % 3, i.e. for input areas of width

idle time becomes negative, which does not make sense
technically. But it simply indicates an (unnecessary) surplus of input space, which may be available or not,
depending on whether there is an immediately following
general cargo unit or not. In particular, for model 3 with
bE ¼ 3lmin , i.e. kE ¼ 3; there appears no idle time at all.
Mutual impediment arising from the presence of general
cargo from station 1 at the input area of station 2 is
eliminated.

To quantify the beneﬁt from the solution presented in this
paper, it is instructive to consider the average idle time of a
general setup with bE ¼ kE lmin . Generally, the idle time
will take some (random) intermediate value between 0 and
wmax . Ignoring possible synchronization effects between
station 1 and station 2, and assuming that every handling
moment is equally probable, the probability that input at
station 2 is blocked by the presence of general cargo from
station 1 is the blockage probability

Noting that Lmin ¼ almin and inserting (4) and (5), we

On the one hand, if a\2, then in the worst-case scenario
considered the efﬁciency becomes zero, while on the other
hand if kE [ 2 þ kGC % 3, the presence of more than just
one general cargo unit within the input area of station 2
needs to be considered, which has been ignored in present
discussion.

For comparison, the maximum and worst-case average idle
times of the concrete models 1, 2 and 3 are listed in
Table 3.
The ‘‘worst’’ case at input station 2 is actually the ‘‘best’’
case at input station 1, which then works with maximum
efﬁciency. In this idealized case, the handling time is always
Topt , which may be adjusted to be, for example, 2.40 or
2.85 s, the MTM values given in Table 2. However, the
idealized optimal handling time at station 1 is certainly
determined by the speed of conveyer 1 and the minimum
necessary handling width, Topt ¼ lmin =v1 . The optimal input
at station 1 in general cargo (GC) units per hour then is
D1 ½1=h ¼ 3600=Topt . Nonzero idle times decrease the input
performance and in the worst case from the point of view of

Note that this efﬁciency does, in fact, only depend on
two technical parameters, the acceleration factor a and the
width of the input area kE relative to the minimum necessary handling width. It has to be reminded, however, that
this expression holds only for a limited range of a and kE .

1. The efﬁciency increases when the width bE of the input area
becomes larger and takes its maximum value for bE ¼ 3lmin (it has
been assumed that lmin % lGC ). The acceleration factor a ! 2 ensures
that there is always sufﬁcient vacant space available to place another
general cargo unit at input station 2

In summary, the divided conveyer belt feeding system,
which has been ﬁrst presented by the author in 2003 [12], and
its potential to reduce, respectively, eliminate the reduction
of input performance caused by mutual impediment have
been discussed in this article. In the course of developing the
system, several validation procedures have been performed
on a prototype with four input stations that produced evidence for the occurrence of mutual impediment and gave
insight into the origins of this phenomenon [12, 16].
The main focus of this article has been the theoretical
investigation of the divided conveyer belt based on the
probabilistic treatment of an idealized model with two
input stations. The reduction of input performance has been
quantiﬁed in terms of the worst-case average idle time that
can occur due to mutual impediment. In good agreement
with the experimental results discussed in Sect. 3, the
model predicts substantial reduction of the deﬁciency
caused by mutual impediment, when the input stations of
the divided conveyer belt are equipped with input areas that
permit spatially variable input. In particular, with an optimal choice of the acceleration factor of the divided conveyer belt feeding system (a ¼ 2) in combination with an
optimal choice of the width of the input area (bE ¼ 3lmin ),
the effect of mutual impediment can be completely
eliminated.
Several limiting assumptions and idealizations have
been applied in the course of the theoretical investigation.
Extensions of the model to overcome these limitations shall
be subject to future theoretical work, simulation and
experiment. The possible extensions include: treating
general probability distributions of handling times, treating
the width of general cargo as random variable, determining
the average idle time for non-worst-case scenarios, considering idle times caused by self-impediment in the efﬁciency calculation and, last but not least, extending the
discussion to more than two input stations.
