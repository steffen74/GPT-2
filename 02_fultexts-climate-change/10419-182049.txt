1 Introduction
For decades shorter product life cycles, foreign competition and growing product diversity have been forcing manufacturing industry to continually ensure an increasing productivity while, at the same time, providing a high level

of ﬂexibility. Group technology and cellular manufacturing
have evolved as successful possibilities to meet these requirements [19]. In the context of manufacturing, group technology is deﬁned as concept of grouping heterogeneous parts
to part families in order to establish efﬁcient production processes [39]. The assignment of parts to part families is usually conducted according to similarities concerning the parts’
geometry as well as required processes, machines and tools.
As similar parts are processed together, particularly setup
times can be reduced signiﬁcantly [39]. Especially the integration of group technology into the concept of lean manufacturing gave impetus for a widespread application in practice [5].
Based on group technology, cellular manufacturing deﬁnes the grouping of resources and machines to autonomous
manufacturing cells on the shop ﬂoor [8]. The objective is
to form independent cells that are capable of processing all
necessary operations for a set of part families. Hence, intercellular material ﬂow is avoided [39]. Besides the minimization of setup times, the main advantages of cellular manufacturing are lower throughput times, decreasing inventory,
higher quality and fewer transport processes. With this, cellular manufacturing can constitute a basis for the successful implementation of just-in-time production [43]. Practical
applications of cellular manufacturing have been reported
in several areas of industry, such as automotive production
[33], electronics manufacturing [14] and semiconductor industry [7].
In cellular manufacturing systems an effective scheduling system is crucial to gain these advantages. While manufacturing cells often constitute a job shop or a ﬂow shop environment, the existence of part families leads to a scheduling task on two levels, usually referred to as group scheduling. On the one hand, a sequence of parts within each part
within a part family can be integrated into processing times,
for every changeover of jobs from different part families
either sequence-independent (SIST) or sequence-dependent
setup times (SDST) have to be taken into account. As an
extension of classical scheduling, static group scheduling
problems with sequence-dependent setup times are known
to be NP-hard already even for single machine environments
[25]. Thus, the development and application of heuristics is
necessary. An effective scheduling system is characterized
by its ability to reﬂect real production environments and especially its dynamic nature. Accordingly, it should be robust
concerning diverse changes of shop conditions [24]. Simple
heuristics based on dispatching rules are able to meet these
requirements particularly since they are easy to implement
in real-world manufacturing systems. Thus, they are of high
relevance for practical applications and considered in this
study.
In this paper, the center of attention are two-stage heuristics that are characterized by three distinct major dispatching decisions [32]: First, the transition between two part
families has to be deﬁned. Exhaustive rules assume that all
jobs of a family have to be processed before a job from
a different family is taken into account. In contrast, nonexhaustive rules allow switching of families even though
parts of the current family are still queuing [21]. As exhaustive rules have shown superior performance compared
to non-exhaustive rules for group scheduling problems [13],
this study is limited to exhaustive rules. Second, a decision
has to be made about which part family is processed. This
family rule also determines the occurring setup times. Finally, a job rule determines the sequence of jobs within the
current part family.
Even though many manufacturing cells are organized as
job shops, only few publications focus on this type of layout [11]. Meta-heuristic approaches have been proposed for
scheduling static and deterministic job shop cells recently
[40,11,38] and static ﬂowshop manufacturing cells still receive various attention [4,18]. However, to the best of our
knowledge dynamic environments have not been considered
since the last simulation study by Reddy and Narendran [30]
and van der Zee et al. [42]. At the same time, several novel
dispatching rules and recommendations for the design of
rules have been proven to be efﬁcient in job shop manufacturing systems without part families [36,28]. Still, these
rules have never been applied to group scheduling problems.
Especially for sequencing part families no combined dispatching rules have been applied and tested so far. Furthermore, the inﬂuence of a cell’s conﬁguration has not been discussed in detail. In this paper we attempt to close this gap,
pursuing a threefold objective: First, an detailed overview
of existing simulation studies in group scheduling environments is given. For the ﬁrst time important results in this

area are summarized in a comprehensive way. This analysis forms the basis for the following identiﬁcation of existing effective group scheduling dispatching rules as well as
novel rules that have not been taken into account for group
scheduling so far. Secondly, these rules are compared to each
other in a dynamic manufacturing environment. By this, the
most effective scheduling rules concerning the objectives of
ﬂow time and tardiness can be identiﬁed. Finally, inﬂuencing factors that have not been considered explicitly in literature so far, such as cell conﬁguration and type of setup times,
are examined in order to give insights on signiﬁcant parameters of a group scheduling production system. To achieve the
last two objectives a comprehensive simulation study is conducted since simulation is known as suitable method for analyzing complex problems with large amounts of data [29].
Two different conﬁgurations of cells are used. Besides a
manufacturing cell with ﬁve machines, that has been widely
used in literature, a smaller cell with three machines is considered. With this, the proposed study can give helpful insights for effective scheduling systems in practical cellular
manufacturing environments.
The remainder of this work is organized as follows: Section 2 gives a detailed overview of previous simulation studies on group scheduling problems. Prior results and the signiﬁcance of various inﬂuencing factors are summarized.
Based on this, open questions are identiﬁed and the studied
simulation model is described in Section 3. A well-founded
selection of exhaustive two-stage heuristics and the chosen
parameters are presented. Section 4 details the results of the
conducted simulation study regarding the performance of
the tested heuristics as well as inﬂuencing factors. Finally,
in Section 5 essential ﬁndings are summarized and aims for
future research are pointed out.
2 Literature review
Since the ﬁrst study in 1960 [2] until today [36], dispatching
rules have been widely investigated in literature and are still
of high relevance for research as well as for practice. While
in the beginning basic dispatching rules had been tested only since the 1990s the capability of developing powerful
heuristics by combining rules was exploited [1]. Moreover,
various inﬂuencing factors for shop performance have been
analyzed. Other research pointed out the signiﬁcance of an
integrated process planning and scheduling [34]. Siemiatkowski and Przybylski [37] modeled and investigated process alternatives in cellular manufacturing systems by a simulation study.
For group scheduling problems several two-stage heuristics were applied and tested in simulation studies since the
1980s [27,29]. An overview of popular and effective heuristics is given in Table 1. Since different shop types showed
in the following. As the setup of a simulation study has a
signiﬁcant impact on the performance of certain rules, basic characteristics and effective dispatching rules are listed
for each study, too. Fundamental insights and the inﬂuencing factors identiﬁed in these studies are summarized in the
following.
Two-stage heuristics versus single-stage dispatching rules
Mosier, Elvers and Kelly [27] were the ﬁrst to prove the
dominance of two-stage heuristics over single-stage dispatching rules concerning production-ﬂow-oriented criteria in job
shop cells. In their simulation study several variations of utilization and setup to processing time ratios were tested. Only
for due-date-based criteria, the use of single-stage rules could
partly lead to superior results. However, no due-date-oriented
family rule was considered [31]. This gap was closed by
Mahmoodi, Dooley and Starr [23] who studied several duedate-based family rules. Still, two-stage heuristics outperformed single-stage heuristics for all criteria. These results
were also conﬁrmed for ﬂow shop manufacturing cells by
Wemmerl¨ v and Vakharia [45]. Besides, two-stage heuriso
tics showed a signiﬁcantly lower variance compared to single-stage dispatching rules, whose performance is greatly
determined by system parameters [27,31]. This justiﬁes a
wide-ranging applicability of dispatching rules within twostage heuristics.
Exhaustive versus non-exhaustive heuristics Mahmoodi and
Dooley [21] observed that exhaustive family rules generally
outperform non-exhaustive rules regarding production-ﬂoworiented criteria. Only for mean tardiness non-exhaustive
rules could improve cell performance in cells with low utilization and loose due dates. Non-exhaustive rules show two
contrary effects: a splitting of part families allows more jobs
to be on time while, at the same time, this results in additional setup operations and, hence, increasing total ﬂow
time. Furthermore, exhaustive heuristics were proven to be
more robust regarding changes of inﬂuencing system parameters, in particular concerning the setting of due dates. The
superiority of exhaustive rules was also conﬁrmed by Frazier
[13]. Moreover, they are readily understandable and easy to
implement in practice.
Number and size of part families Simulation studies conducted by Wemmerl¨ v [43] and Wirth, Mahmoodi and Moso
ier [46] showed that the advantage of two-stage heuristics
compared to single-stage dispatching rules decreases with
an increasing number of part families. This becomes reasonable by considering an extreme example with each family
consisting of a single job only. Understandably, in this case
a family rule does not enhance the performance of a job rule.
Frazier [13] conﬁrms these results in his study for ﬂow shop

3

cells. Furthermore, he states that the number of part families
does not impact the advantageousness of different two-stage
heuristics compared to each other.
A dominating part family with a signiﬁcant higher number of jobs generally leads to lower mean ﬂow times as fewer
setup operations are necessary [43]. As a result, jobs belonging to this part family are less likely to be tardy. However,
jobs from smaller part families tend toward a late date of
completion as the machines are rarely set up for processing
these part families. Particularly under mean tardiness criterion and a high cell utilization two-stage heuristics are often
less robust, i. e. their performance differs widely dependent
on variations of family size [31]. Hence, especially the variation of family size represents a signiﬁcant inﬂuencing factor
for the selection of dispatching rules.
Due date setting procedures Russel and Philipoom [32] investigated the effect of different types of due date setting
procedures. They showed that a heuristic’s performance can
be inﬂuenced by due date setting procedures signiﬁcantly,
especially if mean tardiness is minimized. Nevertheless, superior two-stage heuristics remain favorable regardless of
the chosen strategy. Mean ﬂow time criterion was generally less inﬂuenced by due date setting procedures. Besides,
Mahmoodi and Dooley [21] report a case in that a nonexhaustive rule is superior compared to an exhaustive rule:
in a setting with loose due dates the non-exhaustive dynamic
due-date-based heuristic (DK) rule led to slightly lower mean
tardiness, while with tight due dates DK and earliest due
date (EDD) performed similarly.
Setup times Wemmerl¨ v [43] showed that increasing setup
o
times lead to larger ﬂow times for both, priority rules and
two-stage heuristics. The latter are less inﬂuenced by changes of setup times. In addition, a dominating part family as
well as increasing setup times lead to a broader spread of
the performance of heuristics concerning mean ﬂow time.
Wirth, Mahmoodi and Mosier [46] come to the conclusion
that the size of setup times has no signiﬁcant impact on the
performance of a cell but on the ranking of heuristics.
Cell utilization Furthermore, Wirth, Mahmoodi and Mosier
[46] proved that cell utilization is crucial for its performance.
Cells with a low workload generally result in low ﬂow times
and less tardy jobs. However, the effectiveness of two-stage
heuristics is less inﬂuenced by a varying cell utilization [31].
Cell conﬁguration Mahmoodi, Tierney and Mosier [26] disclosed that generally ﬂow shop cells lead to a similar ranking of heuristics compared to job shop cells as presented
by Mahmoodi, Dooley and Starr [23]. Besides, only few
dispatching rules have been tested in single machine cells

similar conclusion were drawn in single machine environments [43]. Hence, a limited impact of the cell conﬁguration
on the selection of heuristics can be expected. The inﬂuence
of cell size has not be discussed in detail so far.
Distribution of inter-arrival and processing times The greatest impact on shop performance concerning mean ﬂow time
was ascertained by the distribution of inter-arrival and processing times. For an exponential distribution of the arrival
of jobs Mahmoodi, Tierney and Mosier [26] detected strong
differences in heuristics’ performance. However, this effect
is stronger for single-stage heuristics compared to two-stage
group scheduling heuristics. For uniformly distributed interarrival and processing times the differences between heuristics decrease [43].
3 Model description
3.1 Manufacturing environment
The assumed model of a job shop manufacturing cell by
Mahmoodi and Dooley [21] has been applied in several publications already [17,46]. Since it is our goal to analyze the
inﬂuence of several factors on shop performance, the use of
this model allows a direct comparison of the results to previous studies and eliminates the impact of a novel cell conﬁguration on the performance of heuristics. Furthermore, based
on various empirical studies the considered cell represents
a typical size and conﬁguration of real-life manufacturing
cells [31,42,44]. Nowadays, however, an increasing number of reconﬁgurable machines and a concentration of operations instead of diversiﬁcation often lead to smaller manufacturing cells and lower numbers of operations become
more relevant. Thus, a second cell with less machines was
considered additionally. This cell model is also motivated
by a mid-sized injection molding enterprise, that produces
composite thermosetting plastic elements and uses a similar
production system. Besides a closer representation of manufacturing practice, this allows an analysis of the inﬂuence
of cell size on a manufacturing cell’s performance.
In the simulation model a set of jobs j ∈ N has to be processed on one or several machines i ∈ M of a manufacturing
cell. Each job is assigned to a distinct part family f ∈ F. It
has to be noted that a job is not further speciﬁed and may,
dependent on the respective production system, also be interpreted as lot consisting of several identical products. Figure 1 displays both considered types of cells consisting of
ﬁve and three machines, representing limited resources. As
a job arrives in the system all relevant parameters are set and
it is assigned to one of three part families as well as a certain route. In the ﬁrst conﬁguration, referred to as 5M, all

jobs consist of four to ﬁve operations with predetermined
machines. Each route starts with an operation either on Machine 1 or Machine 2 and exits on Machine 4 or 5. Furthermore, Machine 3 is considered by all available routes.
Hence, Machine 3 constitutes a bottleneck that can be used
as a measure for the utilization of the manufacturing cell
[27]. Reentrant material ﬂows are not considered. Every machine is able to treat one operation at a time and started jobs
are not allowed to be disrupted. Moreover, time for transportation is neglected and there are unlimited buffers. The
second cell conﬁguration considered equally consists of the
ﬁrst three machines, but Machines 4 and 5 are not taken into
account anymore. This smaller cell is referred to as 3M. In
front of every machine three queues are established, one for
each part family. With this, for a cell with 5 machines there
are 12 different routes per part family. For the smaller cell
with 3 machines 4 different routes per part family exist.
As described above, several job characteristics that inﬂuence the performance of heuristics have been investigated
very well already and, hence, can provide a practical orientation. In this study, parameters were chosen similarly to
previous studies in order to secure comparability of results.
Job arrivals All jobs are released immediately after arrival
in the system. Inter-arrival times are exponentially distributed.
This guarantees independence of arrivals of two succeeding
jobs and is known to model real-world job arrivals realistically [3,41]. The mean value of inter-arrival times was determined by a pilot study using the basic two-stage heuristic
FCFS/FCFS. With an average inter-arrival time of 70 minutes a medium utilization at Machine 3 of 85% could be
ensured [21], with utilization being deﬁned as proportion of
occupancy time and available time of Machine 3.
Processing times Due to varying material quality and inconstant speed of operation through operation personnel, in reality processing times are often subject to considerable variation. Thus, similar to [31] a third-order Erlang distribution
with a mean value of 60 minutes was chosen, i.e. processing
two parts of the same family are assumed to be part of the
processing times [21]. In contrast, major family setup times
have to be taken into account as soon as the part family is
switched. Since the variation of setup times is usually higher
compared to processing times, a second-order Erlang distribution is used for generating these [25]. Until now, the
inﬂuence of different setup to processing time ratios has
been analyzed for either sequence-independent setups [32]
or sequence-dependent setups [46] only. However, the impact of the type of setup time on the performance of heuristic algorithms has not been studied, yet. Hence, we analyze
the considered manufacturing cell with sequence-dependent
as well as sequence-independent setup times.
– For the case of sequence-independent family setups, a
mean value of 30 minutes was considered.
– Sequence-dependent setup times were determined according to the mean values for every changeover from
a family f to e shown in Table 2.

Based on the literature review in Section 2 as well as the
results of recent studies on dispatching rules in classical job
shop environments, promising novel combinations of family
and job rules are proposed. All tested combinations are exhaustive heuristics, due to their superior performance. Thus,
all jobs of a queue have to be processed before a job of another family is taken into account. The tested heuristics are
as follows:

3

1

0.00

With this, for SIST the mean value of setup to processing time ratio is 0.5, which is in accordance with previous
studies that chose values between 0.1 [43] and 1.27 [25]. It
has to be noted, that for SDST setup to processing time ratio
may differ slightly from 0.5 since the number of setups to a
certain family may be dependent on the proportion of jobs
that are assigned to each family.
Due date Due dates d j for each jobs are determined by Total
Work Content (TWK) technique [45]. A constant parameter
K is multiplied with the sum of processing times t ji of a job
j on all machines i. This value is added to the time of arrival
T j of job j in the cell:
m

d j = T j + K · ∑ t ji

Family dominance An inﬂuencing factor, that is analyzed
in our study, is the dominance of a part family regarding its
size. In nearly all previous publications arriving jobs are assigned to each part family with an identical probability. Nevertheless, as mentioned before, especially two-stage heuristics are affected by a family’s dominance signiﬁcantly. Hence,
besides a uniform distribution of jobs to part families, a strong
dominance of one part family is investigated. The latter is
accomplished by assigning new jobs with a probability of
80% to the ﬁrst part family, while 10% of the arriving jobs
are assigned to each of the other families [31].

3.2 Group scheduling heuristics

Table 2: Sequence-dependent setup times
[min]

heuristic, several values for K have been tested. K = 4.57
and K = 4.11 considering conﬁguration 3M and respectively
5M using sequence-independent setup times with no dominating part families lead to an average tardiness of about
35%, which was chosen for our simulation study.

(1)

i=1

In general, if the value of K is low, due dates become tight
and tardiness of jobs increases. In contrast, a high value of
K leads to loose due dates and ultimately results in no tardiness at all. Due-date-based job and family rules are appropriate to consider this effect. On the basis of the FCFS/FCFS

(1) FCFS/FCFS: This simple heuristic selects the part family that contains the job that arrived ﬁrst at the current
machine (ﬁrst come ﬁrst serve). All jobs from this part
family are processed according to their arrival at the queue
[22]. As one of the ﬁrst group scheduling heuristics that
has widely been used in previous simulation studies, FCFS/FCFS provides a basis for evaluating other rules.
(2) MS/SPT: First, the part family requiring minimum setup
time (MS) is selected. The jobs of this family are sequenced according to shortest processing time dispatching rule (SPT). MS/SPT is known as one of the best rules
for minimizing mean ﬂow time as well as the proportion
of tardy jobs in group scheduling environments.
(3) MS /SPT: Even though recent studies point out the effecMJ
tiveness of combined dispatching rules [36], these have
not been applied for scheduling part families, so far. The
family rule MS is a promising combination. A families e
MJ
priority index Pe is determined by the quotient of setup
time s f ei for a changeover from the currently processed
family f to e on machine i and the number of jobs nei
waiting in the queue of family e at machine i. With this,
Pe =

s f ei
nei

∀e, f ∈ F, e = f .

(2)

Hence, the minimum setup time per job in a queue decides which family is processed ﬁrst. The performance
of this dispatching rule is investigated together with SPT
for sequencing jobs within each family.
(4) MS /SPT+RPT: An additive combination of SPT rule
MJ
and the remaining processing time (RPT, also referred
to as shortest remaining processing time rule SRPT) also
led to good results for job shop scheduling [36]. The job
rule chooses a job j that has the lowest sum of processing times of the current operation u and the processing
times from the current operation u up to the operation on
the last subsequent machine m. Hence the priority index
Pj for each job j is determined by
m

Pj = t ju + ∑ t ji

∀ j ∈ N.

(3)

i=u

Compared with MS /SPT this newly combined heuristic
MJ
serves as a basis for assessing the impact of the job rule
on the performance of a heuristic.
(5) EDD/TSPT: The family rule EDD ﬁrst dispatches the
family that contains the job with earliest due date. All
jobs of this family are sequenced according to TSPT
rule (two class truncated SPT). In contrast to the conventional slack rule (SL), jobs with negative or no slack
are considered ﬁrst and are assigned to a priority queue.
With CT being the current time and t ju the processing
time of the current operation u, a job’s j slack SL j is
deﬁned by

7

Again, part families are sequenced in ascending order
of Pe , while all jobs are sequenced concerning the TSPT
rule. This heuristic serves for evaluating the novel family
¯
rule SL especially.
¯
(7) SL/SL: The SL rule for sequencing jobs within each part
family is considered, which is promising for due-datebased criteria. With Equation 4 the priority index for a
job j is given by
Pj = SL j

∀ j ∈ N.

(6)

It is combined with the new exhaustive family slack rule
¯
SL.
SL
¯ SL
(8) SL/ RPT : Likewise, the novel combined RPT job rule,
that can be seen as slack per unit of remaining processing time, is used for sequencing the jobs within each part
family. The idea behind this rule is that for jobs with
a high number of remaining operations (and therewith
processing time) the probability of waiting times on subsequent machines might be higher compared to jobs with
less work remaining. Hence, jobs with little slack and a
high number of following machines are prioritized by
processing jobs with a minimum priority index Pj at the
current machine u ﬁrst.

MJ /SL:

A combination of a due-date-oriented job rule
with a family rule that takes setup time related information into account may provide good results for minimizing tardiness related criteria. Hence, the combined MS
MJ
rule is used for sequencing families, while SL is applied
for jobs.

All jobs in the priority queue with SL j ≤ 0 are ordered
according to SPT [23]. Each job with SL j > 0 belongs to
a non-priority queue, which is considered only if no job
with negative or no slack exists. For these jobs, again,
SPT rule is used. This rule is known to show a high performance concerning the minimization of average tardiness and serves as a benchmark for novel heuristics.
¯
(6) SL/TSPT: The total slack of a family has been considered several times in a variety of ways, but always as
non-exhaustive rule [21]. Since exhaustive rules gener¯
ally showed superior results, here SL is used in an exhaustive manner. The family priority index Pe at the respective machine i is determined by the total slack of all
jobs assigned to a certain family divided by the number
of jobs

Summing up, heuristics (3), (4), (6), (7), (8) and (9) have
not been tested in the past and are considered for the ﬁrst
time.

3.3 Experimental setup
The described production environment was implemented using simcron MODELLER. This discrete event simulator has
been developed for modeling production processes speciﬁcally. In the beginning of every simulation run, the production system is empty and undergoes a warm-up period [15].
Similar to previous studies, the length of the warm-up period
was predeﬁned with 2,000 hours. Dependent variables were
not recorded during this timespan. After the warm-up period
for each run, 8,000 hours of the manufacturing process were
simulated [21,22]. Since reliable results can be realized by
a long duration of a run rather than by frequent reiterations,
type and part family dominance leads to four scenarios for
both conﬁgurations 3M and 5M:
Scenario I: sequence-dependent setup times with no dominating part family
Scenario II: sequence-independent setup times with no dominating part family
Scenario III: sequence-dependent setup times with dominance of one part family
Scenario IV: sequence-independent setup times with dominance of one part family
In order to achieve statistically precise results 40 runs were
performed for each conﬁguration. Hence, the number of simulation runs in total is determined by
2 conﬁgurations· 4 scenarios · 9 heuristics · 40 runs
= 2, 880 simulation runs.

(8)

Statistical tests are necessary to prove the signiﬁcance of
different rules or experimental factors. In order to evaluate
ascertained results for differences in heuristic performance,
a two-sample t-test was performed for a conﬁdence interval
of 0.95. Also, a two-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) as
well as a one-way ANOVA for speciﬁc rules were conducted
to examine possible effects of experimental factors.

3.4 Performance measures
In order to evaluate the performance of heuristics and the
impact of inﬂuencing factors a production-ﬂow-oriented as
well as two due-date-based measures are monitored. Production-ﬂow-oriented performance measures are used to minimize the total work in process (WIP) and, therewith, inventory as well as capital commitment costs [6,16]. In contrast,
due-date-oriented performance measures aspire a punctual
completion of jobs in order to minimize contractual penalties and customer discontent [35].

1. The minimization of mean ﬂow time F represents the
ﬁrst objective and equals a job’s time in the system. Flow
time is a common performance measure in job shop environments. It is deﬁned as the sum of completion times
C j less the release times r j concerning all jobs j divided
by the total number of jobs n [10]:

2. In this study, we consider mean tardiness T as ﬁrst duedate-based performance measure. It is deﬁned as the average difference between the completion time C j and

3. Since contractual penalties are not necessarily proportional to tardiness but can be incurred as ﬁxed penalties
per tardy job, besides mean tardiness the proportion of
tardy jobs is considered as second due date related performance measure. It is deﬁned as number of tardy jobs
divided by the total number of jobs:

4 Results and discussion
4.1 Mean ﬂow time
General results Table 3 summarizes the average values over
all studied scenarios and ranks all investigated heuristics
regarding mean ﬂow time. A line between heuristics indicates differences that are not statistically signiﬁcant according to two-sample t-test. It can be seen that considerable divergences arise subject to the selected heuristic. However,
Figure 2 shows, that the relative performance of all heuristics comparing 3M and 5M in all scenarios is very similar.
Furthermore, data conﬁrms the results of previous studies
that the application of dispatching rules that are calculated
similarly to the considered optimization criteria are usually
promising. Due-date-based dispatching rules generally lead
to higher ﬂow times compared to production-ﬂow-oriented
rules.
Results with respect to scenarios All four scenarios lead to
similar results concerning the ranking of heuristics, showing statistically insigniﬁcant differences only. Overall, either MS/SPT or the novel MS /SPT heuristic perform best,

¯ SL
followed by the MS /SPT+RPT heuristic. The novel SL/ RPT
MJ
heuristic performed as poor as FCFS/FCFS and even showed
the weakest effectiveness considering family dominance (cf.
Table 3).
Inﬂuence of job and family rules However, novel combined
job rules cannot lead to an improvement of mean ﬂow time
in general. Out of all production-ﬂow-based rules SPT+RPT
shows the weakest results compared to single dispatching
rules. Using MS family rule, SPT job rule leads to between

0.3% (Scenario II - 541.52 vs. 543.27) and 1.4% (Scenario

SL
2.7% (Scenario I). Among due-date-based job rules RPT offers the least performance. It is outperformed even by the
simple FCFS/FCFS heuristic. Moreover, TSPT outperforms
SL
RPT by 7.1% (5M, Scenario I) to 15.3% (3M, Scenario III),
¯
both tested with SL family rule. This dispatching rule prioritizes jobs with larger remaining work if slack is equal. Thus,
it prefers jobs with longest processing time while jobs with
smaller processing times have to wait and, consequently,
mean ﬂow time is increasing. Apparently, this negative effect dominates the original idea of anticipating possible setup
operations as described in Section 3.2. An overall improvement of up to 15.3% depending on the chosen job rule indicates a strong impact of the job rule on a heuristic’s performance.

In scenarios of equal sized families, except Scenario II in
5M conﬁguration, the novel combined MS /SL heuristic outMJ
perform due-date-oriented heuristics. In Scenarios III and
¯
IV, EDD/TSPT and SL/TSPT generally show superior results. This, again, suggests a strong inﬂuence on the performance caused by the job selection rule. If a dominating part
family queue is chosen TSPT prioritizes according to SPT,
within priority and non-priority queue. This helps to process
efﬁcient the jobs of this part family until a time consuming
setup is required. In case of equal sized families, there are
more setups which can be better managed by the MS family
MJ
rule and the impact of the job rule decreases.

4.2 Mean tardiness
General results Concerning all scenarios applied to 5M conﬁguration, comparisons of the best and worst heuristics show
differences between 30.7% (Scenario II) and 38.4% (Scenario I). Considering scenarios with families of the same
size and 3M conﬁguration, this difference is very similar. A
dominating family leads to performance differences of even
up to 49.4% (3M, Scenario III). With MS family rule and
MJ
replacing the SPT+RPT job rule by SPT, small improvements of 1.0% (Scenario II) to 3.8% (Scenario IV) can be
aspired im 3M conﬁguration. But regarding 5M, much more
improvement of up to 9.2% (Scenario I) can be achieved.
Results with respect to scenarios In comparison to results
with ﬂow time objective, for mean tardiness the ranking of
heuristics varies considerably dependent on the regarded scenario (see Table 4). This implies a signiﬁcant impact of the
studied inﬂuencing factors. Due-date-based dispatching rules
are not advantageous in all scenarios. Instead, for sequencedependent setup times and part families of the same size
(Scenario I) the novel MS /SPT heuristic leads to the lowMJ
est average tardiness in 5M conﬁguration. MS/SPT, which
is also an production-ﬂow-oriented rule, follows even with
a statistically signiﬁcant difference considering 5M conﬁguration. Regarding 3M all heuristics using the MS family rule
MJ
¯
heuristics regarding both conﬁgurations.
No clear statement can be made about the advantageousness of production ﬂow or due-date-based rules for Scenario II in 5M conﬁguration. Thus, the proposed MS /SPT
MJ
¯
and SL/TSPT heuristics are as efﬁcient as the well known
MS/SPT and EDD/TSPT heuristics. On the contrary, production-ﬂow-based family rules signiﬁcantly outperform duedate-based family rules in the same scenario considering
3M. This also applies to both conﬁgurations with respect
to Scenario I shown in Table 4.
Both scenarios with family dominance result in a similar ranking in both conﬁgurations. Due-date-based family
¯
heuristics like SL/TSPT and EDD/TSPT signiﬁcantly per¯
formed best, followed by SL/SL, MS/SPT and MS /SPT reMJ
spectively. Similar to mean ﬂow time criterion, MS /SL is
MJ
outperformed by due-date-oriented heuristics in all scenarios of family dominance as well as Scenario II using the
5M conﬁguration. Remaining scenarios show an opposite
ranking. Thus, family rules beneﬁt from the consideration of
setup information in scenarios of equal sized families. This
is reasonable since setups occur more often in this case. Fi¯
nally, the novel SL/TSPT shows superior results for scenarios of family dominance and MS /SPT for scenarios of equal
MJ
sized families.
Inﬂuence of job and family rules Applying SL as job rule
SL
instead of RPT results in a decrease of average mean tardiness between 12.2% (Scenario II) and 30.4% (Scenario IV)
considering the 5M and even between 18.0% (Scenario I)
and 45.6% (Scenario III) using 3M conﬁguration if, at the
¯
same time, families are sequenced by SL.

4.3 Proportion of tardy jobs
General results Table 5 shows the simulation results and
the ranking of heuristics considering the proportion of tardy
jobs. A comparison of charts displayed in Figure 3 and Figure 4 shows that the rankings of heuristics are generally
similar to those gained considering mean tardiness. Furthermore, both conﬁgurations are similar and even comparable
to the ranking with mean ﬂow time criterion in the case of
equal sized families (cf. Table 3). Thus, ﬂow-time-oriented
heuristics like MS /SPT and MS/SPT show best results.
MJ
Results with respect to scenarios Scenario II with 5M conﬁguration shows that novel MS /SPT outperforms all other

MJ /SPT performed superior in respect of the proportion of
tardy jobs. In contrast, due-date-oriented heuristics performed
poorly and the novel combination of a ﬂow-time-oriented

ranking. Furthermore, Figure 4 shows, that the novel SL/
TSPT rule performs more robust than EDD/ TSPT. In Scenario I and Scenario III considering 3M EDD/ TSPT performs very poor while in all other scenarios the performance
of these two heuristics is similar. The novel combined job
SL
rules SPT+RPT and RPT are outperformed by the simple
SPT and respectively SL rule in all scenarios. FCFS/FCFS
¯ SL
and SL/ RPT perform worst. The results show, that the criterion of proportion of tardy jobs is very robust regarding both
sets of family sizes and setup times. Furthermore, they indicate that a fast production ﬂow is particularly successful to
achieve less tardy jobs.

4.4 Multi-criteria evaluation
In order to evaluate whether certain heuristics are dominated by other, the heuristics’ performance considering several performance measures is investigated in this section by
the use of selected scatter plots with Pareto-fronts, one for
each Scenario.Considering mean ﬂow time and proportion
of tardy jobs the rankings of heuristics resemble over all
scenarios. In case of differences usually one superior rule
evolves, which is mostly the novel MS /SPT. Exemplarily,

this is illustrated in Figure 5. A similar Pareto frontier is
gained in Scenario I and Scenario II considering mean tardiness and proportion of tardy jobs (see Figure 6). MS /SPT
MJ
dominates most often all other heuristics.
The decision for an superior heuristic is crucial in the
case of mean tardiness and proportion of tardy jobs, particularly in Scenario III and Scenario IV. Considering Sce¯
nario III EDD/TSPT and SL/TSPT perform well to minimize mean tardiness, whereas MS /SPT and MS/SPT showed
MJ
superior performance considering the proportion of tardy
jobs. Thus, depending on the priority of criteria the respective rules should be preferred (see Figure 7). Furthermore,
MS
MJ /SPT tends to be superior considering the proportion of
tardy jobs and MS/SPT is more suitable to minimize mean
tardiness, as shown for example in Figure 8.

4.5 Cell size
Table 3 indicates less ﬂow time in all scenarios considering
the three machine conﬁguration. This is reasonable, since
there are less machines requiring a processing of operations.
Considering the criterion of mean tardiness and proportion
of tardy jobs the data of 5M conﬁguration resemble those
of 3M conﬁguration. This also can be explained by the adjustment of due dates according to Total Work Content technique (TWK) to achieve a similar proportion of tardy jobs
in both conﬁgurations.

As it is shown in Figure 2, Figure 3 and Figure 4, graphs
of both conﬁgurations have a similar shape with respect to
the regarded scenarios. Thus, each scenario inﬂuences both
conﬁgurations in a very similar manner. The only remarkable difference concerning the minimization of mean tardiness effects the ranking of EDD/TSPT and MS /SPT+RPT in
MJ
Scenario II.

Depending on the respective scenario the best performing heuristic compared to worst heuristics leads to between
12.7% (Scenario II) and 15.7% (Scenario III) lower mean
ﬂow time in case of ﬁve machines and between 14.7% (Scenario II) and 18.6% (Scenario III) in case of 3 machines.
Considering all scenarios the difference between the best
and worst heuristic is always at least 2% greater in the 3M
conﬁguration compared to 5M. This indicates that in small
cells the selection of a good heuristic is more crucial. In
larger cells with a higher number of operations these differences may be alleviated by subsequent stages. At the same
time, however, statistically signiﬁcant differences in the ranking of heuristics appear less frequent in the three machine
conﬁguration compared to 5M (cf. Table 3, 4 and 5). Thus,
differences between the well performing heuristics are less

4.6 Analysis of inﬂuencing factors
Analyzed factors Tables 3, 4 and 5 summarize the substantial impact of the studied inﬂuencing factors, i.e. setup type
and family dominance. Besides, Table 7 displays the results
of the conducted analysis of variance (ANOVA) while the
nomenclature is given in Table 8. With a level of signiﬁcance of 0.95 an inﬂuencing impact is indicated by a value
F ≥ 3, 9. This value considers the quantity of simulation
runs per scenario and heuristic as well as the number of
speciﬁcations per factor. Furthermore, the total spread SST
consists of several spreads caused by the inﬂuencing factors
type of setup time (SSSDST /SIST ) as well as family dominance
(SSeq/dom), their interaction (SSinteraction ) and spread of errors SSE .
Family dominance In general, a dominating family leads
to a lower mean ﬂow time and less tardy jobs. As shown
in Table 7, almost the entire total spread is caused by the
factor of part family dominance, regardless of the performance measure. Considering mean ﬂow time this proportion is larger in 5M conﬁguration compared to 3M, except
¯ SL
for SL/ RPT heuristic. This indicates a stronger factor impact
of part family dominance in larger cell conﬁgurations. It can
be explained by a higher number of setup operations if more
stages are taken into account. Regarding the proportion of
tardy jobs the impact of family dominance is stronger particularly in the large cell conﬁguration.

The effect size of dominating part families is pointed
out in Table 9 and Figure 9. It is apparent that the dominance of a certain family has a strong impact on the performance of heuristics. Concerning the ﬁve machine conﬁguration and mean ﬂow time criterion for all heuristics, except
¯ SL
for SL/ RPT , over 95% of the total variance can be explained
by the dominance of families, while this is the case for over
82% of the variance with mean tardiness criterion and even
over 97% for proportion of tardy jobs criterion. This implies that the mean tardiness is less inﬂuenced by changes
of the family dominance compared to ﬂow time and proportion of tardy jobs. However, at the same time, mean tardiness is effected considerably by other inﬂuencing factors,
such as variances of setup, processing or inter-arrival times,
which is also indicated by a high spread of unaccountable
errors (SSE ) as shown in Table 7. According to Table 4, for
mean ﬂow time and proportion of tardy jobs the ranking of
heuristics remains unchanged independent of the underlying
scenario while major differences can be identiﬁed for varying scenarios for mean tardiness. With a dominating family
due-date-oriented heuristics lead to superior results, whereas
production-ﬂow-based heuristics performed best in settings
with equally distributed family sizes.

reasonable since a dominating family results in fewer changeovers between jobs of different part families and, therewith,
fewer setups. This also applies to mean tardiness and proportion of tardy jobs in the case of family dominance (see
Figure 3 and 4). However, the results of Table 7 indicate
a higher inﬂuence for heuristics with ﬂowtime-based family
rules compared to other heuristics (i.e. larger value FSDST /SIST ).
This is plausible since respective heuristics choose the family according to setup information. Still, the inﬂuence of
the type of setup times remains rather low. Furthermore, the
type of setup time effects the performance measures much
less than the family dominance as shown in Table 9. Con¯
sidering mean ﬂow time criterion even SL/TSPT proves to
be effected signiﬁcantly by the type of setup time considering both conﬁgurations. The remaining due date-based family rules seem not to be inﬂuenced signiﬁcantly at all (e.g.
¯ SL
SL/ RPT ) or a very small inﬂuence is proven to be signiﬁcant
for only one certain conﬁguration.
In general, regarding setup type the three ﬂowtime-based
heuristics MS/SPT, MS /SPT and MS /SPT+RPT and the novel
MJ
MJ
MS
MJ /SL heuristic are much stronger inﬂuenced by the choice
of sequence dependent or independent setup times than the
rest of the tested heuristics. For example the spread caused
by setup type using MS /SPT is more than 6,000 times higher

compared to FCFS/FCFS (considering 5M and mean tardiness). Nevertheless, in total only a very small part of total
spread is inﬂuenced by the setup type.
Interaction of factors Since the type of setup time has only
low impact, a spread caused by interaction between both
factors is very small as well. It should be emphasized that
spread caused by uncountable errors (SSE ) is much higher
considering mean tardiness compared to mean ﬂow time or
proportion of tardy jobs. Hence, the tested heuristics generally show higher performance variability and, therewith, less

tive spread gained by other rules. This means that each effect independently impacts the performance measure. This
is also indicated by a comparison of scenarios for each ﬂowtime-based family rule with all three performance measures
(see Tables 3-5). It reveals that SDST always lead to superior results than SIST. In contrast, all due date-based family
rules as well as the FCFS/FCFS heuristic proved to be better using SIST under equal sized families and SDST under
family dominance. Apparently, there is a considerably interaction effect of both factors which proved to be signiﬁcant
by the two-way ANOVA shown in Table 7. This means that
one factor depends on the level of the other factor. Although
the testing value FSDST /SIST and the spread SSSDST /SIST of
the respective heuristics is very small, this might still indicate a signiﬁcant impact for this special case. Therefore, we
additionally exploited an one-way ANOVA by keeping the
factor of family dominance constant. Since the impact of
the type of setup time is uncertain for due date-based family rules and FCFS/FCFS heuristic only (i.e. high interaction
effects), Table 6 summarizes testing values for these respective heuristics. Therefore, an inﬂuencing impact is indicated
by an value of F >3,96.

Considering the testing value Finteraction all heuristics and
scenarios show a signiﬁcant interaction effect of both tested
factors considering mean ﬂow time. The same applies to the
proportion of tardy jobs, except for MS /SPT+RPT heuristic
MJ
in 3M. Considering mean tardiness, there is no signiﬁcant
interaction effect for MS /SL heuristic as well as MS /SPT+RPT
MJ
MJ
and MS /SPT in 5M and MS/SPT in 3M. In general, the spread
MJ
caused by both factors (SSinteraction ) is much smaller considering ﬂow time based family rules compared to the respec-

The results shown in Table 6 generally prove, that the
type of setup time signiﬁcantly impacts all three performance
measures in both conﬁgurations. No statistical signiﬁcant ef¯
fects are determined only for SL/TSPT considering mean
¯
ﬂow time and mean tardiness in 3M as well as SL/SL considering proportion of tardy jobs in both conﬁgurations with
equal sized families. Furthermore, the type of setup time impacts scenarios with family dominance much more than scenarios with equal sized families, except for EDD/TSPT considering mean tardiness and proportion of tardy jobs in 5M
Considering the testing value Feq/dom all results show a sig¯ SL
niﬁcant inﬂuence of the factor family dominance, with SL/ RPT
leading to the smallest values in almost all scenarios. This
is reasonable since the respective factor spread SSeq/dom is
lower and the error spread is higher compared to the respective spread caused by other heuristics. It indicates a generally low robustness or high performance variability of the
respective heuristic.
Furthermore, Figure 2, 3 and 4 show a signiﬁcantly higher
variance concerning the achievement of objectives for mean
tardiness and proportion of tardy jobs subject to the chosen
heuristic. This implies that especially for due-date-based criteria the selection of an effective heuristic is crucial. This
conﬁrms the results by Wemmerl¨ v [43]. In general, the
o
novel MS /SPT heuristic shows the least varying performance
MJ
¯
subject to the chosen scenario. The proposed SL/TSPT heuristic is more robust compared to EDD/TSPT, which is known
as a preferable heuristic so far, but less robust than the novel
MS
MJ /SL heuristic.

5 Conclusions
In this study we applied several novel heuristics for dispatching a dynamic job shop manufacturing cell. Based on
a thorough analysis of previous simulation studies, some research gaps concerning the inﬂuencing factors of the type of
setup time as well as the dominance of a single part family
could be identiﬁed and closed. In summary, following conclusions can be drawn:
– The selection of an effective heuristic is crucial for shop
performance, particularly concerning mean tardiness and
partly the proportion of tardy jobs. For mean ﬂow time
the ranking of heuristics proves to be robust with respect
to the considered scenarios. In contrast, for mean tardiness criterion the variation regarding the advantageousness of certain heuristics is considerably higher. As an
exception, production-ﬂow-oriented dispatching heuristics lead to the least tardiness for scenarios with families
of equal size.
– The dominance of a part family has a signiﬁcant impact
on the achievement of objectives. This can be explained
by fewer setup operations with a dominating family. Scenarios with family dominance are strongly inﬂuenced by
the type of setup time. In general, the inﬂuence of the

small cells the choice of a good heuristic is more important compared to large cells. Signiﬁcant differences
between effective heuristics are more frequent in large
cell conﬁgurations.
– In general, no signiﬁcant differences could be identiﬁed
between the family rules MS- and MS as well as between
MJ
¯
SL and EDD. However, for the scenario with no dominating family and SDST, the proposed novel rules lead
to a substantial improvement considering the mean tardiness. Furthermore, a signiﬁcant improvement through
MS
MJ /SPT could be shown in the scenario of no dominating family and SIST considering the proportion of
tardy jobs. MS /SPT dominates other heuristics most freMJ
quently. Job rules are proven to have a great impact on
the heuristics performance. Furthermore, for most simulation runs, combined job rules lead to inferior results
compared to elementary dispatching rules.
– While the ranking of heuristics is strongly inﬂuenced by
¯
the chosen performance measure, the SL/TSPT heuristic appears to be robust with a satisfying ranking position among all measures and scenarios and even with
top ranking position in scenarios of family dominance
taking mean tardiness into account. In total, MS /SPT is
MJ
identiﬁed as the preferable heuristic for mean ﬂow time,
proportion of tardy jobs and even for mean tardiness
on scenarios of no dominating part family. With family
¯
dominance SL/TSPT is a favorable choice to minimize
mean tardiness.
¯ SL
– The well-known FCFS/FCFS and the novel SL/ RPT showed
the weakest performance regardless of the performance
measure and the scenario. Thus, they should be avoided
for practical applications.
Summing up, it can be concluded that not all heuristics
that have previously been identiﬁed to be superior (see Table 1) are suitable for dispatching manufacturing cells effectively. Additionally, some novel superior heuristics like
MS
¯
MJ /SPT and SL/TSPT should be considered for future research.
The presented results also point to interesting directions
for future research. In particular, a validation of results of
this work and previous studies with real time data from practical manufacturing environments is necessary. Due to the
extensive simulation study no signiﬁcant differences concerning the effectiveness of dispatching rules and inﬂuencing factors should be expected. Nevertheless, nearly no case
study on group scheduling production systems has been reported in literature, which proves theoretical results from
simulation surveys in practice. Besides, the gained insights
still have to be veriﬁed for ﬂow shop manufacturing cells.
Furthermore, the interaction of other inﬂuencing factors and
their effect on the performance of heuristics should be inte-

17

grated in future simulation studies. Especially, the inﬂuence
of varying cell conﬁgurations and layouts as well as buffers
has not been analyzed exhaustively. Even how the proposed
heuristics are effected by different, well studied parameters
concerning job arrival, processing times and due dates requires further investigation. An integration of ﬂexible process plans or workforce would increase the applicability of
these results for real-world manufacturing systems. In this
paper, different cell conﬁgurations were considered for the
ﬁrst time. Since previous research included varying cell utilization, further research might concentrate on the impact of
diverse cell utilization rates with different types of cells.
In this study we were able to show that combined family
rules can improve the performance and particularly the robustness of two-stage heuristics. Future research should test
further combinations of dispatching rules. Moreover, beside
dispatching rules more sophisticated heuristics, e.g. based
on constructive heuristics such as NEH, could be tested in
dynamic environments. Generally, future research should focus on approaches that are able to meet the challenges of
practical scheduling systems with changing and uncertain
conditions.
