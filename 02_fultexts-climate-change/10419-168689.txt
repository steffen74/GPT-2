The evolution of mankind shows that the town and town arrangements play an important
role in changing the economic and cultural tools of various territories and favour their
development, since towns have always been one of the essential components of the human
civilisation and equally the place of many important economic, social and political events.
At the same time, it is worth mentioning that the strong development of distribution,
through all its trade forms, has had an important impact on the configuration and the
modelling of territorial systems and, especially, urban areas (A. Villani, 1995, p. 20).
In the context of unprecedented growth of towns, one of the essential components –
distribution, through all trade companies – has had a major impact on the configuration and
urban modelling. Neglecting the factors essential for analysing the existing situation or
neglecting forecasting the development of urban facilities, such as the commercial network,
causes major problems with direct impact on living conditions and habitat that favour social
cohesion. With this premise in view, the paper suggests a model for assessing regional
disparities that come up in the development of distribution. Although we agree to use the
term “distribution” instead of the classical term “trade” when dealing with economic
activity in relation to market conditions, we choose to further employ the term “commercial
facilities”, since, in our opinion, it suits the town planning paradigm, which from a system
perspective, covers the territorial-functional structure of towns and develops relations
between elements of the urban system (in which commercial facilities, as spatial built
elements, hold a clearly defined position), while the cooperation between these elements
have a synergetic effect perceived only as wholeness.
1. Modelling the urban area: A brief presentation
The modelling theory of urban area is over two and a half centuries old. All throughout this
period, the theoretical approaches and the instruments used have helped us to acquire
experience focused on a systemic view of the evolution of the planned area, and various
authors – who have written the classics in the domain – have proposed various types of
reasoning to explain the factors influencing the relation between the supply of and demand
for urban territories. This long period of accumulation and formation of concepts specific to
urban economics can be divided into two long periods:
•

The classical period, when the forerunners of today’s systemic approach
understood the need for integrated (holistic) analysis of phenomena occurring in
urban territories; the holistic study of urban and territorial phenomena began with
the development in time of theoretical explanations regarding the territory
structuring by the nature of human activities on the mentioned territories.

•

The period of spatial (urban and territorial) modelling, beginning in the sixth
decade of the 20th century, as a result of the evolution of urban economics, as well
as to the requirements of the general theory of systems.

The 1960ties brought along the construction of the first models that tried to promote the
general theory of systems in town planning and territorial studies. The analysis of this
period reveals the following types of models:
•

100

•

global urban models;

•

AE

integrated town planning.

We further present some of the well-known models that differ in objectives, theoretical
fundamentals and procedures. It is worth mentioning that these models can also be applied
to dimensioning the commercial facilities as a distinct module of an urban system in a
specific territory.
Models of market potential in urban territories
Using mainly gravitational analogy, these models focus on the assessment of the flows of
people and vehicles that occur between the hubs of a network consisting of commercial
facilities, inhabited areas, etc. These models can be used to dimension roads and
commercial facilities, to analyse labour migration, to define territorial macro zones, in
accordance with the potential developed around the attraction poles consisting of tourist
objectives, commercial facilities, cultural endowments, etc.
Allocation models of urban activities
The models are used to locate a homogenous function (living, industry, etc.) on a ground
within an urban locality or region. This category includes separate models: for living, for
locating commercial centres, and for industrial areas. The allocation models of urban
activities are considered partial ones, and this, although controversial, persisted because
many partial models were included – later on – as component modules of global models of
formation and growth of social spatial systems.
Global urban models
The global urban models (considered by some authors as holistic, general or
comprehensive) focus on:
a)

the simultaneous description of interactions of various partial activities
(functions), and

b) the projection in time of the behaviour of urban and regional phenomena.
The model of metropolis worked out by Ira Lowry (1994) may be considered the prototype
of several global urban models. An essential contribution was made by J.W. Forrester
(1969). He had a systemic view of processes. These processes are generated by the growth,
stagnation and “responses” of cities under the impact of a package of corrective measures
and policies initiated by urban communities.

Since the late1980’s, the EU Sustainable Development Strategy has paid special attention to
sustainable development of the European towns of any size, which represent economic,
social and cultural assets of high value. According to the Leipzig Charter of the European
Sustainable Cities (May 24-25, 2007), cities cannot fulfil on long term their function of
engines of social progress and economic growth, in accordance with the Lisbon Strategy,
which is focused on steady development of the information technology and innovation
stimulation in order to close the gaps between the European countries and the USA.
The city development in the European Union is based on the new concept (model) of
integrated town planning, which shifts the state’s role from the control of city development
to the stimulation of local enterprise. Thus, we promote the integrated project of urban
regeneration, which, in accordance with the modern view on urban economics, is a new
model of city management, based on a joint strategic view on development, aiming at
creating (Ginavar Anca and team, 2007, pp. 8-9):
•

several levels of intervention: punctual, in areas in need, and correlated with the
logic of global development of the city;

•

several intervention sectors: economic, social, environmental, territorial.

This project is drawn up and defined according to a process logic (focused on
transformation) that puts together: (1) traditional urban actors – public administration, and
(2) new actors representing the citizens, professional organizations, national and
international investors.
2. The functional integration of commercial facilities into urban regeneration projects
The city can be defined from three perspectives: dimensional, qualitative and systemic.
The dimensional definition reveals three permanent characteristics of the city:
•

a concentration of buildings able to ensure the minimum density required by the
urban area1: residential density, housing density, job density;

•

sustainability ensured by the opportunities offered by the established geographical
environment for people to live and work in;

•

diversity and ranking of activities carried out within the city (a social environment
including activities such as trade, industry and administration).

The qualitative definition received recognition because all quantifiable criteria did not
suffice to define a city. The qualitative approach is based on the opinion that the city is a
type of entity which an individual can easily perceive, without stating the formal
characteristics.
In accordance with the systemic approach, some authors think that the city is “an
organisation destined to maximize social interaction” or “an organisation mediating

1

J. Bastié and B. Dézert, 1991, p. 31.

no city unless there is a core able to unify, control and organize the suburbs”2.
Urban regeneration promoted by the European Union implies a set of action principles for
sustainable development of the cities3:
a)

Urban regeneration means the intervention of the public authorities in urban areas
in distress.

b) Urban regeneration requires an integrating approach to all sectors of intervention
(including commercial facilities), so that those urban operations should aim at
sustainable development.
c)

Urban regeneration requires good local governance.

d) Urban regeneration requires that all local actors should be able to integrate
European policies into town planning as local policies.
Considering the city a spatial-constructional and social system, we may outline two large
sub-systems: town planning and social sub-system. While the town-planning sub-system
includes all material elements of a city, including environmental factors that form the
territorial structure, the social sub-system consists of the number of inhabitants as
beneficiaries of the whole system.
The direct links between the commercial facilities – as components of the town-planning
sub-system – and the social sub-system, materialized in purchases of goods, place
distribution under the influence of social processes taking place in the city territory,
especially under the influence of the demographic, socio-economic and territorial structure.
While town planning seems generally to be the city arrangement science, commercial town
planning is a specific aspect, which essentially tries to satisfy the population’s commercial
needs by locating and creating a shop network. In other words, commercial town planning
means all efforts and means used by architects, town-planners, and economists to adapt the
trade to the new living conditions and the new population concentrations.
From this angle, the commercial facilities of an urban community should be integrated into
urban regeneration projects. This integration actually meets the requirements of commercial
town planning, which can be grouped as follows4:
•

The capability of the commercial network to develop, resulting in larger selling
area, in close relation to the demand for goods, in accordance with the main
characteristics of the potential market and the opportunities for urban
development.

•

New problems caused by the changing relation between the traditional trade
centre and the trade centres in the new housing areas.

•

The attractiveness of the urban trade network to people from other localities and
the location of these new customers; in fact, the size of the attracted population is

3. An assessing model of territorial disparities in the development of commercial
facilities
Economic and social development is not equally distributed throughout the country. We
notice economic and social disparities/inequalities between regions in all countries.
Literature shows two types of disparities5:
•

disparities in the spatial distribution of welfare or in the real income level;

•

disparities in the spatial distribution of economic activities and of the population.

These disparities are always assessed, explicitly or implicitly, in relation to a reference
case. They imply a deviation from an estimated rule. The use of the term “disparity”
implicitly involves a regulatory judgement of what is acceptable or unacceptable6. The
selection of the indicators considered for demonstrating the existence of territorial
(regional) disparities depends on the context in which the research work is conducted. Box
no. 1 presents a list of indicators of urban sustainable development.
In the European Union, the new approaches to the regional policies support a few
innovative strategic views for territorial economic growth such as:
•

A broader sense should be given to the concept of regional disparities, adding to
classical disparities (regarding the production, income or unemployment level)
new types of imbalances in environment quality, infrastructure, education
opportunities, access to skills, capital availability, etc. The inclusion of these new
disparities located upstream in regional economic policies is a means to stimulate
competitiveness and capability of regions to develop by themselves7.

•

There are disparities in economic development not only between regions but also
within the same region. Therefore, regional policy should often become subregional policy and should not be separated from urban policy.

•

Globalisation, the rapid progress of technology and the profound geopolitical
changes are factors that determine the disappearance or the crisis of some
activities, which are accompanied by the emergence of other ones. This problem
needs urgent action especially in central and eastern European countries, where the
magnitude of structural adjustments is higher, if compared to EU developed
countries. In this context, it is required to make structural adjustments, which
should be stimulated locally and regionally as well as nationally.

•

In the new circumstances, the objectives of the regional policy are difficult to
attain without cooperation between national public authorities and local public
authorities, enterprises or even other countries.

Increasingly more attention is paid to the role of the private mediation or
cooperation organisations: chambers of commerce, local banks, information
exchange centres, and risk capital providers.

Box no. 1:
Indicators of sustainable city development
The implementation of a strategy in support of sustainable development
requires, as a premise, a database that should allow us to create a system of
(quantitative and qualitative indicators) necessary, on the one hand, for assessing the
economic and social potential of a region/district in several aspects such as condition,
structure, dynamics and behaviour of the actors in various markets, and, on the other
hand, for ensuring a certain orientation of the decision-makers in the local
communities on the development direction, in order to maintain the condition of
efficiency and balance.
Specialists classify sustainable development indicators into five large sub-systems:
1. The sub-system of factorial indicators, including demographic-economic
resources, natural resources, means of production, progress of science, as
well as management factors (factors contributing to the organisation of the
structure of economic agents, areas and territory, of the decision-making
system, which facilitate the effective use of resources).
2. The sub-system of resultative indicators, including the main indicators
characterizing the material production and the production of consumer
services, education, culture, arts, tourism, city management.
3. The sub-system of distribution and adjustment indicators, among which the
indicators regarding the banks, the balance of payments, the incomes and the
distribution of goods play an important role.
4. The sub-system of demographic and social indicators, including social
indicators (habitat, social-professional mobility, cultural level, social
homogeneity, delinquency, etc.).
5. The sub-system of national wealth indicators, including a set of categories of
indicators: (a) indicators of natural resources; (b) environment value; (c)
human capital indicators (active population, health stock, rate of public
education by forms of schooling); (d) indicators of financial capital; (e) the
value of the cultural patrimony; (f) consumer goods (housing, durables).

Relating the issues concerning the regional disparities to commercial facilities, as a subsystem of the urban system, we present below a model for analysing these inequalities.
We consider a model of allocation of urban activities, namely the “point method”, which
allows ranking of territories (in our case study, they are districts), starting with a set of
indicators (factors influencing the equipment level) that, in an interconditioning relation,
can define the size of a module of the urban system built within an urban setting for
sequential module of the urban structure, namely commercial facilities.
We exemplify this method by a function exercised by commercial facilities in district
capitals, as central places that polarize the population to be potentially served in an area
outside cities. Thus the point method could enable us to forecast locations for the trade
network in districts, in relation to an indicator of “saturation” established in accordance
with 10 factors, also called diagnosis characteristics (C1-10). For building a mathematical
model, we considered the following factors having a direct impact on the development level
of the commercial equipment on a territorial basis:
F1 – monthly net average nominal wage earnings (RON);
F2 – turnover from wholesale and retail trade, repair and maintenance of motor vehicles
and motorcycles and personal and home appliances per capita (thou. RON); it is an
indicator aggregated per economic activity (NACE, rev.1);
F3 – population density per sq. km (people);
F4 – weight of urban population (percent);
F5 – rural population per 100 hectares of agricultural area (persons);
F6 – employees in non-agricultural branches per 1000 people;
F7 – employees in industry per 1000 people;
F8 – number of accommodated tourists per 1000 people;
F9 – density of public roads per 1000 sq. km of the administrative territory of the district;
F10 – number of settlements (towns or villages).
This system of factors, expressed in indicators calculated in different measure units needs
to be transformed into units that can be added (totalled). Such an operation can be made by
means of points (what explains the name of the mathematical model). Concretely, the
following steps are taken:
Step 1: We choose from among the counties the ones with the maximum value reached for
each of the 10 indicators (Table no. 1); this maximum value corresponds to the maximum
grade of 100 de points. For our application, with statistical data for the year 2006, we have:
•
•

Dâmboviţa District reaches the maximum value for F5;

•

Arad District holds the maximum value for F7;

•

106

the Bucharest-Ilfov Area registers the maximum values (considered equal to 100
points), for: F1, F2, F3, F4, F5 and F9;

Source: based on the data presented in Table 1.
For instance: for Bacău District, the number of points for the factor (characteristic) F2 –
“the turnover of the whole trade and retail trade, repair and maintenance of the vehicle, and
motorbikes and personal and house assets per one inhabitant (thousand RON); is the
aggregated indicator at the economy activities level (sections NACE rev.1)”, was calculated
as follows:
C2 =

F2
7 ,0
⋅100 =

P41 corresponds to Bucharest – Ilfov.

for each of them, they were given a grade of importance from 1 la 10, that is: F1=10, F2=9,
F3=8, F4=6, F5=4, F6=7, F7=5, F8=2, F9=3, F10=1.
By the coefficient of each factor with these importance grades we got the comparing values
of the 10 factors (Table no. 3).

Source: the data presented in Table 2.
Step 5: The points total sum for a given district – S(Ji) – is calculated based on the formula:
10

S (J i ) = C1 (J i ) + C2 ( J 2 ) + ... + C10 (J10 ) = ∑ C1 (J1 )

(3)

i =1

For instance, for Bacău District:
S = 748.0 + 135.9 + 7.2 + 298.2 + 329.2 + 289.8 + 278.5 + 29.2 + 227.7 + 3.8 = 2411.5
The application of the “points method”, as a model of allocating an urban activity, in our
case of the trade activity, has as hypothesis/premises the principle according to which the
total points sum for a district – S(Ji) – corresponds to a certain level of endowment with
commercial spaces – D(Ji) –, expressed in the commercial surface (sqm) per 1000
inhabitants.

D(J i ) =

DT
⋅ S (J i )
ST

(4)

where:
D(Ji) – accidental variable which indicates the size of the commercial premises/1000
inhabitants for a given district (Ji);
DT – the non-accidental variable, representing the endowment with the commercial surface
per 1000 inhabitants, as an overall country prognostic;
ST – the overall sum of country points;
S(Ji) – the points sum for each district.
According to these marks, the district ranking is based on the total (cumulative) score of the
influence of explanatory factors regarding the trade network concentration (Table no. 4).

Source: based on the data presented in Table 3.
The cumulative impact of the influences of explanatory factors regarding the development
potential of commercial facilities on a territorial basis reveals a polarisation phenomenon, a
concept established in the theory of spatial economics, which shows a “centre-periphery”
relationship. The form to be taken by this polarisation is conditional on the country’s
history and geography. Specifically to Romania, the data in Table 5 reveal that territorial
disparities in districts’ economic-social development have caused a polarisation of the
profit of the districts that have first undergone urban development – districts with a
cumulative score above country average, such as Bucharest-Ilfov, Braşov, Prahova, Cluj,
Timiş, Sibiu, to the detriment of farther districts, located in the lowest extreme of the score
– i.e. under 2000 points – such as Tulcea, Vaslui, Botoşani, Giurgiu, Ialomiţa, Teleorman,
Călăraşi.
One must emphasize that for every district the points sum indicates the place that it holds in
the district ranking from the perspective of the (sale) market potential, dimensioned by the
aggregation of the 10 factors taken into consideration in the applied model. This district
ranking according to the market potential size conditions the size of the quantitative
indicator deviations of endowment with commercial spaces – sqm of commercial surface
per 1000 inhabitants – compared to an average accepted level as a balance limit per total
country.
To exemplify, we accept a hypothetical value of 600 sqm commercial surface per 1000
inhabitants considered as an average per total country (DT), by using the formula 4.
We calculated the endowment that would be justified, for two districts situated at the
hierarchy’s extremes:
•

D=

112

Bucharest – Ilfov:

600
⋅ 4970 = 1160 sqm/1000 inhabitants

Teleorman

600
⋅ 1738 = 405 sqm/1000 inhabitants
2572

This example shows the need to approach the development of commercial facilities in
relation to the theory of central places and polarisation, respectively, which shows an
oversizing of the trade network in districts with a cumulative score above country average
in “peripheral” districts. While for top districts by the cumulative score, a higher
endowment with trade network is justified, then for peripheral districts, the endowment is
lower, considering that they are generally characterized by a limited local market, an
asymmetrical location in relation to the national market, a more specialized economic
structure, often based on natural resources, and a less trained and less diversified
workforce.
Conclusions
The need to assess the disparities in the level of development of urban systems built at the
country level is shown by the paradigm of the model of integrated town planning, which
covers the realities of towns: 1) the built area (all elements of the urban system, including
also urban facilities, among which commercial facilities hold a top position); 2) the socioeconomic territory (valued by the functions of a town, among which the economicproductive function, the housing function, the communication function, the ecological and
recreation function, the esthetical function, the strategic function); and 3) administrative
entity (ensuring town governance, based on a common strategic vision concerning the
development and the assignment of tasks among urban actors).
As mentioned above, any integrated project of urban regeneration implies a new way of
town management – town governance. Good town governance consists in a mix of two
large categories of economic policies, considering the disparities in regional development8:
•

regional policies; they address regional disparities in income or employees (per
capita); these policies often try to orientate spatial distribution of economic
activities (income sources and jobs);

•

regional development policies, they address support of specific regions for
promoting development; that is, implementing economic development policies on
a regional scale.

Very often, the question of promoting the development of pauperized regions is assimilated
within a policy for eliminating regional disparities. Such integrated projects of town
development should also include the dimensioning and the structuring of commercial
utilities, which are going to create, (to involve themselves, along with utilities,) the urban
comfort and achieve sustainable development of towns.
The “saturation” indicator, determined on the basis of the 10 diagnosis characteristics
(influence factors on the market potential in territorial profile) as a sum of points, represents
a major criterion concerning the development of the main urban endowments and it can be

found in several sectors. Useful applications of this method can be found in other domains
specific to the urban economy: real estate, socio-cultural and leisure activities endowments,
etc. It is obvious that, according to the market type, the specific influence factors on the
respective market will be established.
