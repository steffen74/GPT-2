sustainable management of waste electrical

great harm to the environment [3–5]. The entire issue is exacerbated by the
relatively short product life cycle of some EEE products such as mobile phones
and laptops [3, 6].
To counter the growing environmental threat of WEEE, suitable End-of-Life (EoL)
treatments are required which can recover value from a product at its end of life and
lessen its waste and pollution. The overall objective of reclaim practices is to prevent
pollution of the environment and extend the product lifespan, by either recovering the
material value (recycling) or recovering the component value (repairing, repurposing or
remanufacturing) [7, 8].
Apart from environmental advantages, EoL reclaim strategies are also likely to
bring social advantages and economic profit, as less raw material, energy and more
unskilled workforce is needed to produce components. The materials that would
be lost via landfill disposal could be rare and valuable as well as recyclable [9].
EoL reclaim strategies can therefore be seen as a sustainable solution of WEEE as
it has advantages to the three pillars of sustainability. The main reason of only
20 % of WEEE is being treated correctly nowadays is the lack of knowledge on
sustainable product reclaim strategies, starting at the product design and manufacturing stage of product life.
This article consists of two sections. The first section is a literature review which
aims to identify the current state of Global WEEE management, including best
practices being employed to manage electronic waste (e-waste). The focus of this
review shall centre on the European Union (EU) and the People’s Republic of China
(PRC) which are thought to be suitable representatives of both a developed and
emerging economy respectively. The second section consists of a practical in which five
different types of mobile phones have been disassembled. The aim of this practical is to
identify technical barriers in disassembly and EoL reclaim in mobile phones. Evaluation
is done on the time needed for disassembly, the ease of disassembly, joining methods,
materials used and component weight among others. Both technical and non-technical
barriers are given in order to justify which material/component reclaim strategy is most
profitable and to what extend it can be used. Possible mechanisms for improvements on how the sustainability of the global WEEE management can be enhanced
to make EoL reclaim profitable are suggested in the end of the article, which is
followed by a conclusion.

Overview of current global WEEE management
There are few truly global policies that deal with the management of WEEE. The most
notable one is the 1989 Basel Convention which aimed to reduce the movement of hazardous materials around the globe [10]. In particular, it aimed to lessen the amount of
hazardous waste being exported to emerging economies and impact of it on both the
local populace and the environment. A later 1995 amendment resulted in the absolute
ban on the export of hazardous waste from industrialised nations to less economically
developed nations. This ban though is frequently found to be flouted with the classification of e-waste as working EEE being one of the most common exploits [2, 11, 12].
Typically, most countries seek to manage WEEE through the introduction of national
environmental legislation to manage the issue of WEEE. This legislation typically puts into

Countries are known to use other nation’s legislation as the foundation or inspiration of
their own attempts to solve the issue of WEEE management [13].
EU policy on WEEE management

By 1998, six million tonnes of WEEE were created in Western Europe annually and this
quantity was found to be increasing at a rate of 3–5 % per year [9, 14]. This led to the
development of EU Directives to combat the spread of WEEE and the hazardous substances contained within. EU Directives are the foundation of European Union giving
guidance to its member states. They are formulated at the continental EU level with
the objective of providing leadership and direction on a particular subject by setting a
goal or target that must be met within a specified time. They are then implemented at
a national level where it is the prerogative of the state government to determine how
the goal will be met [15].
When discussing WEEE in the EU, the two most pertinent EU Directives are the
Waste Electrical and Electronic Waste (WEEE) Directive (Directive 2012/19/EU
[16]) and the Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS) Directive (Directive
2011/65/EU [17]). The effects of these Directives on the management of WEEE in
the European Union have been extensive. Recovery and recycling targets have been
adopted across the Union for WEEE with the rate expected varying depending on
the product type. The typical collection rate is expected to be between 50 and
80 % [9, 16]. Another requirement of the WEEE Directive is the implementation of
an Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) scheme which mandates that the producer of EEE must prepare for WEEE [2, 13, 16]. This involves the producer funding the collection and recovery schemes as well as the EoL treatment processes [2,
9]. The treatment processes must meet EU requirements and the options available
to producers are extensive [2, 18].
Chinese policy on WEEE management

China is the world’s largest emerging market for EEE and has one of the significant
issues with e-waste which is growing at a rapid rate of approximately 13 to 15 % a year;
this is further exacerbated by the import of WEEE from developed nations [9]. It is estimated that up to 80 % of e-waste from the United States is exported to Asia with the
vast majority going to China [19].
The Chinese government has enacted several major pieces of legislation over
the last two decades. Beginning in 1996, following the Basel Convention, its first
act to deal with the growing threat of WEEE was the Decision on Several issues
on Environment Protection which prohibited the import of hazardous and solid
municipal waste to China [20]. The State Environmental Protection Agency of
China (SEPA) is tasked with implementing this ban on municipal and WEEE import. The next major law was introduced in 2005 and led to the development of
“the Management Method on Prevention and Cure of Environmental Pollution in
WEEE” by SEPA which looked to strengthen measures covering recovery and reclamation, EoL treatment companies and hazardous substances [9]. Further legislation, influenced by WEEE management processes in other areas such as the EU,
was created to implement an EPR-like scheme for China. This legislation was

Appliances and Electronics Products”. It bears many similarities to the EU’s
Extended Producer Responsibility scheme but has a few key differences which are
investigated later.

Commonalities and differences in global WEEE management

Global WEEE management can vary substantially from country to country. Even
between the EU and the PRC, where China bases some of its policy on the EU WEEE
management programmes, there can be significant areas of difference.
Landfill policy

With EU legislation regarding WEEE based on only two directives and the Basel
Convention, it is important that they are robust enough to encourage proper management of both EEE and WEEE. The primary objective of the European Commission,
later the European Union, was to reduce the impact of EEE and WEEE on the environment. This objective was not limited to solely the production and disposal of EEE.
Instead it aimed to reduce the impact on the environment throughout the life cycle of
a product. A fundamental part of the EU’s WEEE management policy is that WEEE is
banned from landfill and must instead go through some form of EoL treatment [2].
Chinese policy does not explicitly ban the entry of WEEE into landfill [9].
Extended producer responsibility

One of the most important concepts that underline the EU’s position on WEEE
management and EOL treatment is the idea of Extended Producer Responsibility
(EPR) [2, 13]. By putting the onus on the original producer of EEE to prepare
adequate resources for dealing with WEEE, the EU has developed a steady means
of funding safe and environmentally conscious EoL treatment for WEEE. The
required treatments are specified within the EU Directives. Chinese strategy follows
the same approach as the EU when it comes to EPR albeit with a few alterations.
In China, producers of EEE must choose from a selection of government
sanctioned e-waste EoL treatment plants. Informal collectors are prevalent though
and this makes the task of official companies and groups more difficult as the
unofficial options are able to undercut them at any point [13, 21, 22]. It has been
suggested that informal collectors and official recyclers be merged to achieve a
“best of both worlds” solution that is both cheaper and more environmentally
conscious than the current systems [13, 23].
Collection and recovery targets

The collection of WEEE for proper EoL treatment within the EU has an objective of
gathering between 50 and 80 % depending on the product [9, 16]. This target is not
being met though with some estimates saying that, at most, only 19 % of WEEE in the
EU is collected for adequate EOL treatment [2–4]. To improve the WEEE management
situation, it is important that these targets are met and that more electrical and
electronic waste (e-waste) is sent to EoL treatment facilities.
Chinese collection targets are higher than the European Union for most products
with a standard rate of 70 % for all WEEE as opposed to the range of collection targets

Advantages and disadvantages of current WEEE management

Approaches to WEEE management from both the EU and China have distinct merits
and faults. While they encourage responsible consideration of WEEE they contain loopholes that are actively exploited.
Landfill policy

Regarding the prohibition of e-waste entering landfill in the EU, the biggest advantage
of this policy is the obvious environmental benefits gained by restricting the entry of
hazardous materials, such as lithium polymer batteries, into landfill where they could
contaminate the soil and ground water. It is important to note that this ban incurs
significant costs as EoL treatment for WEEE can be extremely expensive and nonprofitable in some cases. The EU has developed a different policy to try and mitigate
this negative aspect; Extended Producer Responsibility.
Extended producer responsibility

Advocates of the EU’s EPR approach cite many potential advantages to this approach.
By forcing the producers of EEE to consider the whole life cycle of their product, and
adopt the associated costs of EOL treatment; funding for sustainable and responsible
EOL treatments can be secured without forcing the costs upon local government waste
departments. Traditionally, it is difficult to make EOL treatment for WEEE, such as
recycling, profitable as the value of extracted materials rarely exceeds the cost of
extraction. By placing the cost on the producer, the funding to overcome this shortfall
is available. An additional benefit of forcing this cost onto the producer is that they are
encouraged to make their EEE products as easy as possible to recycle or dispose as they
have to pay to cover the costs of such actions. This motivates the producer to design
their products to contain fewer hazardous substances, lower the chance of obsolescence
or failure and be easier to recover value from during the recycling process as this will
reduce the EOL expenditure faced. At the same time, companies may be able to use
the recycled material to repair or manufacture new EEE products at a reduced cost.
However, it is important to note that this focus on EPR can also be a crutch to proper
WEEE management and has its opponents. Some EPR programs may result in operational
EEE products being categorised as WEEE and recycled rather than reused. In the event of
an insolvency scenario regarding the producer of EEE, there is little or no reserve funding
available to the EOL treatment processes. At this point, the EOL treatment group must
either seek governmental or institutional support or seek to cut costs. Neither scenario is
ideal as it places costs on taxpayers or could result in reduced environmental performance. The difficulty of recycling certain WEEE products, such as lithium-based batteries
and leaded glass is also seen as a barrier as it may place extreme costs on the producer
with regards to transport, storage and disposal. These increased costs could be so large
that they have to be passed directly to the consumer circumventing the objective of EPR
which was to move EOL costs from the end consumer to the producer. Additionally, the
increased costs for companies that have to plan for EOL treatment could make them less
competitive as they have to either increase the cost of their device compared to competitors from outside the EU or reduce expenditure elsewhere which could include research
and development leading to a stifling of technological advancement and growth. Another
issue that has been argued to have developed from EPR is the exploitation of a loophole

developing nations so instead, groups are classifying WEEE as EEE for reuse which allows
for export to places such as Africa (see Section 1) where it is disposed of in a lessenvironmentally conscious manner at much lower or zero cost to the original equipment
manufacturer (OEM).
Furthermore, another issue is that, in practice, still a significant amount of WEEE in
developed countries has been sold to third party brokers who arrange shipment, via
containers, to China, other Asian countries and sometimes Africa [25, 26]. Some materials are then recovered not follow the recycling regulation of the exported developed
countries [27–29].

Collection and recovery targets

Environmental targets such as those for collection and recovery are excellent ways of
motivating national governments to take WEEE management seriously and the associated penalties that come with failing to meet them further strengthen this motivation.
However, it could be seen that targets are difficult to track and are open to interpretation in some cases.

Motivation

Both approaches have their advantages and disadvantages. Strong legislation ensures
that the process is done properly but at the same time, an increase in red tape can
make it more difficult for the venture to be financially sustainable. The profit approach
has the opposite problem. Companies that make a profit are more likely to survive and
will encourage new entries into the market to improve the efficiency of the EoL processes; however, a lack of legislation may result in companies cutting too many corners
in the search for profit causing avoidable environmental damage.

Current end-of-life practices
Across the world, a wide variety of EoL treatment processes are used. These can be
gathered into seven overall categories of which six are sustainable. These categories are,
in the hierarchy of reclaim value: remanufacturing, reconditioning, repairing, recycling,
repurposing, reusing and disposal.
From the five-step waste hierarchy in EU legislation [30] shown in Fig. 1, the
aforementioned treatments are within top 3 tiers for the most sustainable options where the waste was recovered into a product (commodity). One of the
distinct differences between these treatments is that recycling involves extracting
recyclable materials from a waste product (not necessary for whole product recovery) and turning the materials into different and new applications. On the
other hand, the rest five treatments maintain the waste product in its original form. The
relationship between remanufacturing, reconditioning and repairing was further described
in other literatures [31, 32] in comparisons of the product performance, accompanies
warranty and labour work requirement as Fig. 2 shows.
Furthermore, as seen in Fig. 1, disposal is the only EoL practice that is not sustainable
to an extent and is inferior to recovery in the waste hierarchy that the product was

Fig. 1 The EU waste hierarchy [30]

Remanufacturing

One of the most accurate definitions of remanufacturing is: “The process of returning a
used product to at least OEM original performance specification from the customer’s perspective and giving the resultant product a warranty that is at least equal to a newly manufactured equivalent.” [33, 34]. An advantage of remanufacturing is that the high-quality
build and full-length warranty of a remanufactured product removes that perception if it
is properly communicated. Remanufacturing of EEE products has three major disadvantages: cost, difficulty and technological obsolescence. The cost of remanufacturing a product can be quite extensive if it is a complex assembly like most modern EEE products are.
This stems from the level of work and testing that would be required to ensure that it
reaches like-new performance and that it is worthy of a like-new warranty. Remanufacturing is rare or non-existent in the EEE sector of the market due to the extremely complex
nature of computer chips and the rate of change of technology on those chips. However,
early research and testing is underway with some electronic companies, including IBM,
looking at the possibility of remanufacturing EEE products in a profitable manner [13].


Reconditioning

Reconditioning can be defined as: “The process of returning a used product to a
satisfactory working condition that may be inferior to the original specification. Generally
the resultant product has a warranty that is less than that of a newly manufactured
equivalent. The warranty applies to all major wearing parts” [33, 34].
Reconditioning is a fairly common procedure that can be widely found in the EEE
sector with reconditioned computers, games consoles and phones being available for
purchase. Items returned under warranty are usually returned in a reconditioned form.
Reconditioning is normally cheaper for the consumer and manufacturer than producing a new item and this makes it a popular option for WEEE. Additionally, it extends
the product lifespan which both saves the environment and allows more value to be
gained through the use of the product. The most common argument against reconditioning is that it sometimes carries a stigma of being more prone to future failures
which can put off consumers and lead to them simply purchasing a new device anyway
and dumping the old product.
Repairing

Repair is more specific than reconditioning and remanufacturing in that it only targets the
specified faults of the product. It is solely focused on rectifying the identified fault and does
not consider the overall condition of the product. [33, 34]. The warranty of repaired products tends to only cover the repaired component itself. Almost any EEE product can be
repaired assuming that the damage is not too extensive and the damaged component can
be reached in disassembly. The biggest benefit of repair is that it is typically quicker and has
a lower short-term cost when compared to reconditioning and remanufacturing although it
can be argued that in the long-term costs are actually higher for the consumer as less value
is added and therefore the product is more likely to reach its EoL again in a shorter period.
Recycling

Recycling can be defined as a system where waste materials are gathered, sorted and
processed into a usable form to be used in the production of different and new products [33, 34]. Recycling is very common in the EEE sector and is widely used in products that cannot be successfully put through any of the other EoL treatments. This is to
recover valuable materials such as copper, aluminium, gold, tantalum and polycarbonates among others, which are commonly found in electronic devices. It can also be
used extract toxic materials such as cadmium, lead or mercury [9]. The biggest challenge faced by recycling is the difficulty and associated costs with extracting the precious or rare materials. Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs) are notoriously difficult to
extract any profitable value from and, like with most modern electronics like phones
and televisions, everything is integrated onto the PCB causing great problems for recyclers. Early work has begun on the development of a recycling method for PCBs which
helps to solve the current problems [13].
Repurposing

Repurposing is the identification of a new use for a product that can no longer be used

[33, 34]. Repurposing is either free or cheap and is a good way of extending the
potential life of a product. Repurposing is extremely rare in EEE as electronics typically
have few uses outside of their original design objectives making it a non-viable option
in most cases of e-waste.
Reusing

Reuse is when a subsystem or component of a product is being operated in a manner similar to the original design goal without modification. The most common example of this
would be second hand use of mobile phones from developed countries in developing nations. EEE devices are commonly reused mobile phones frequently being donated to charity
or sold via EBay among others.
Disposal

If none of the sustainable EoL treatment options are viable, the final option is to dispose of
the product in the most environmentally friendly way possible. For WEEE, landfill is rarely
an option and is outright banned in some nations, including most in the EU, unless the device is properly treated to remove toxic or hazardous substances. The more common approach for e-waste is incineration where the product is burned after decontamination
treatment to minimise environmental risk. Energy can be recovered from incineration [4].

Current best practice in global WEEE management
WEEE management policy

The diverse nature of WEEE management and the vast cultural differences around the
globe make identifying the best WEEE management policy a near impossible task. A
system that may work well in one country may be totally unsuited to another meaning
that every country is likely to have a unique system that best suits its current position.
A classic example of this that China has officially sanctioned recyclers thanks to decades of informal collection and reclamation. A system of that level of regulation in the
EU would be more likely to discourage companies from entering the market hence the
EU’s more laid back approach [13, 35, 36].
There are a few common elements that can be considered best practice in most
countries although this must be cautioned with the advisement that the details of each
policy should be tailored to the individual nation. Extended Producer Responsibility
(EPR) [37–39] schemes have been quite successful where they have been implemented
and have had the benefit of improving the performance of EoL treatment processes as
well as moving the funding burden from consumers to the producers of EEE. Additionally, environmental targets for collection and recovery have been successful in encouraging countries to do more to adopt sustainable EoL practices.
End-of-life practices

Considering the many options available in WEEE strategy, the identification of the best
available option can be a difficult task but it can begin by eliminating those EoL
treatments that are clearly not applicable or workable is a good starting point. Due to
the extreme difficulty in remanufacturing electronics like PCBs, remanufacturing can

Repurposing also not a viable option in the vast majority of WEEE cases due to the
singular nature of most electronics.
Having eliminated the most unworkable options, the next step is to identify the best
practice, or combination of practices for WEEE at EoL. Reuse is arguably one of the
most sustainable option for WEEE as it extends the life cycle of a product and can be
repeated several times. Once reuse no longer becomes an option, either component
recovery (remanufacturing/reconditioning/repairing) or material recovery (recycling)
are sustainable options. In the event of a small fault with an EEE device such as a
cracked or scratched case or software fault, a simple repair or reset is probably the
most cost-effective option. For more complex issues such as a failed component, reconditioning is a more viable option since the expense of performing a repair is most likely
to be only marginally lower than a reconditioning. The advantages of a complete device
check and the addition of a small warranty will outweigh the slightly increased cost in
most consumers’ eyes. Remanufacturing is another option in which the product loses
its identity due to the use of new components. Remanufacturing gives the most amount
of added value to a product but is often not viable for EEE products due to the rapid
change of technology and fashion. When component recovery is not feasible WEEE can
be placed through a recycling process to recover the most valuable materials that are used
in the production of EEE devices. These include rare Earth metals that carry a high
current value and are finite resources. Additionally, the mining process for certain materials, such as nickel, gold, tantalum and other rare earth elements, is very damaging to the
environment and often comes with social injustice. Following successful recovery of material and components, the remaining non-recoverable material should be disposed of by
incineration with as much energy as possible recovered from the process [9, 40, 41].

Limitations of current practices
Disassembly of the five phones

Limitations of the current practice are identified by means of a practical exercise in which
five different types of mobile phone are assessed on how well they can be disassembled and
what End of Life technique suits the components best. The aim of the practical exercise is
to identify the design issues that hinder and aid the remanufacturing of mobile phones, in
order to identify limitations in the current WEEE best practice. The mobile phones (presented in Fig. 3) are disassembled in order of release date:

all components are available, (5) reassembly of the components, and (6) testing of the product [33]. Whereas non-technical product characteristics are determined by external
factors, there are also technical phone design features where phone designers have
a direct influence on. Examples of such design features that can ease the remanufacturing process are:
1. In the cleaning stage:
Design of components with smooth, corrosion resistant and non-adhesive
surfaces [33].
2. In the disassembly stage:
The use of threaded fasteners (screws), modularity and novel disassembly
techniques (soluble or shape memory fasteners) [33].

Identification & evaluation of design issues that hinder & aid component/material reclaim
in each phone
Samsung E370

The oldest phone of the five is the Samsung SGH-E370. It is a phone where the screen
needs to be slid up in order to reach the key pad. Upon disassembly it was noted that
this slide system is relatively complex. The phone consists of two major parts: the front
slider screen and the main circuit board including keypad. For this reason a double
plastic casing was needed with two fronts and two backs (see Fig. 4). The screen and
the circuit board parts were attached with a complex but innovative rotational spring
mechanism. Many (22) screws (threaded fasteners) were used in this phone with
unequal lengths but with the same head and thread. For this reason only one screwdriver was needed for disassembly. Due to the use of screws, clips and pins, the mobile
phone has a potential to be disassembled easily and reassembled without causing
damage. Although the joining methods facilitate easy disassembly, there is one weak
point in the design features that detriments the ease of disassembly of the entire phone:
the data cable is fragile and is required to fold and extend between the slider screen
and the main circuit board when the phone is closed and opened respectively (see
Fig. 5). Because the data cable connects the slider screen part and the circuit board part
of the phone neither parts could be disassembled without breaking the data cable.
Upon further investigation the soldered attachment of the data cable to both circuit
boards meant it was not easily replaceable without reheating the solder, which would
require more equipment, energy, time and expertise, thus increasing the cost of disassembly. Also the button shield was made of non-durable thin plastic that could not
withstand the force of disassembly. The data is displayed in Table 1.
Time for disassembly: 15 min
Time for reassembly: 15 min (relatively long due to the large number of screws)
Sony Ericsson C902

The Sony Ericsson was by far the most difficult phone to disassemble. It was heavier
than the other phones and had a more durable look because of the use of stainless steel
was rather than aluminium.2 The back cover and battery were easy to remove. The
aluminium separator between the battery compartment and the main circuitry was
spot-welded inside the casing. This inhibited the ease of disassembly significantly and
made the recovery of the metal separator more difficult. Removing the separator took a


Fig. 5 The weakest link in the ease of disassembly of the Samsung E370: the data cable connecting the
two parts of the phone was soldered and could not be removed without breaking it

relatively long time, and because it needed to be done with force it resulted in damage
to the cover and internal components. With a weight of 6.3 g, the monetary value of
this component could be around £0.01 per part for new aluminium, or £0.005 for scrap
aluminium, which translates to around £100 or £50 for 10,000 parts. This is a low
monetary value for a component which is difficult to remove. Considering that the
phone itself contains mainly polycarbonate3 and PCB-mounted electronic components,
the stainless steel back cover appears to be the most profitable component as it may
have a value of between £0.011 and £0.032 and requires almost no labour to extract.
Another feature of this phone is that it uses plastic-melt-rivets to securely connect
components together. Although this is a fast and secure method of joining two components, it makes disassembly both difficult and time consuming. When extracting the
“top plastic” part from the “main casing” both parts were damaged and could not be
reused. This meant that the polycarbonate material must then be recycled or disposed
of in landfill - neither of which is desirable. From the disassembly it could be seen that
this particular phone was designed to be durable from a customer perspective. It was
absolutely not designed for disassembly. The data is displayed in Table 2 and a photo
of the disassembled phone is shown in Fig. 6.
Time for disassembly: 30 min
Time for reassembly: none (reassembly was impossible due to large amount of
broken components)


Nokia 1661-2

The Nokia 1661-2 casing was made out of thick and durable polycarbonate. The joining
method of the casing was done with durable snap-fits. The main body with screen was
attached by six torx head screws (see Fig. 7). The reason for using torx heads is because
they allow a more equally distributed force from the screw driver on the screws, reducing the likelihood of driver head slippage, and thus preventing damage to the screw
head or surrounding circuitry. The use of torx screws is relatively common and therefore screwdrivers are available, however, unfortunately the team did not have such a
screw driver and therefore further disassembly of the Nokia phone was impossible.
Upon limited investigation the internal components of the phone appeared to be
modular and straightforward to disassemble. None of the components were damaged,
and although not all of the components could be disassembled due to the lack of a torx
screw driver, the Nokia phone seemed durable, simple and designed for disassembly.
The data is displayed in Table 3.
Time for disassembly: 5 minutes (up to the main body with torx head screws)
Time for reassembly: 1 minute
Samsung GT-E1150i

The Samsung GT-E1150i is a foldable phone. Just like the other Samsung phone, this
phone consists of the screen part and the main circuit board and keypad part. It
therefore has the same complexity with a double front and double back casing as the
Samsung SGH-E370 (see Fig. 8). The data cable between the screen part and the main
circuit board part goes through the hinge of the phone and just like the Samsung SGHE370 opening and closing of the phone causes potential wear of the data cable.
However, in this model the data cable is less affected than for the Samsung SGH-E370.
The casing of the screen part of the phone was attached with snap-fits and was simple,
modular and could be reassembled easily. The aesthetic cover was attached to the
casing with double-sided adhesive tape and guide pins, and needed to be pulled off with
force. Because of the joining method used the aesthetic cover could not be reattached
as before, as some of the guide pins were snapped upon disassembly. This aesthetic
cover was just for adding colour and did not provide access to the internal components
of the phone. When compared to the modularity of the screen part and its


Fig. 8 Photo of the disassembled Samsung GT-E1150i

components, it is likely that the manufacturer has chosen adhesives just for the
aesthetic cover because it was never meant to come off and snap-fits for the internal
screen components in order to provide a means of disassembly. The main circuitry part
of the phone with the key pad was also able to be disassembled, just like the screen part
of the phone. This phone is a non-smartphone that is designed in the time of smartphones, thus it is seen that modularity and disassembly have been considered. However,
the main speaker in this phone was attached to a PCB using solder with adhesive paste
covering this joint. This potentially detriments the ease of detachment of what could be
a transferable component for use in a reuse process. Furthermore, the speaker is a
component with a relatively stable technology - a factor that further lends it to reuse
(as will be discussed later). The data is displayed in Table 4.
Time for disassembly: 18 min
Time for reassembly: 10 min
HTC Sensation 4G

The last phone that was disassembled is a smartphone. The first impression from the
disassembly was that smartphones are complex, containing many sub-assemblies, and
that these sub-assemblies could be disassembled into a large number of components.
Disassembly therefore took a lot longer and was more complex. However, the phone
seemed to have been designed for disassembly and the complexity of the smartphone
was simplified by the use of four layers
First the back cover and the battery were removed in the conventional way using a
sprung push-button. The back cover in turn consisted of three components: the middle
aluminium frame and the top and bottom polycarbonate parts. These three parts were
connected with snap-fits and two screws (see Fig. 9). These parts consisted of an
integrated antenna and two aluminium grilles for the speaker.
The second layer consisted of a plastic frame in which the battery was placed, an
aluminium shield to protect the internal components from heat and radio waves, and
the speaker was attached in this layer. The speaker had a sticker with component
information. After removing this layer by unscrewing six screws and twelve snap-fits,

Fig. 9 Photo of the disassembled HTC Sensation 4G

The third layer was the “computer layer” which comprised two circuit boards: one at
the top and one at the bottom (the battery fits in between the two circuit boards). The
circuit boards were connected with a flat data cable. The top circuit board consisted of
the two cameras (front and back), the on/off switch, the volume switch, speaker
circuitry and the microphone. The bottom circuit board consisted of processors, ZIF
connector blocks, pins for battery, micro USB, micro SD, vibration motor, graphics,
internal memory, wireless connectivity. The slot for the SIM-card and external memory
was glued on the bottom circuit board but could be reassembled. There were two
aluminium shields for radio-frequency protection. These shields were attached by
crimping and were not able to be reassembled. Once the circuit boards were taken out
by disconnecting various ZIF connectors, the fourth layer was reached.
The fourth layer consisted of the screen of the phone. An aluminium cover was the
main frame of the phone. The LCD screen was attached to this frame with adhesive
tape. The outer layer was the front screen which was made out of durable gorilla glass
which was attached with heat dissolving adhesives. The digitiser was attached on the
back of this screen in between the gorilla glass and the LCD screen, and connected to
the bottom circuit board with ZIFs.
Upon reassembling the smartphone was able to turn on. This shows that this phone
has a potential to be disassembled without damage to the main components. The data
is displayed in Table 5.
Time for disassembly: 45 min
Time for reassembly: 25 min

Summary of identified product features which hinder component/material reclaim
Screw length, size and head differences

The difference in screw length and size can hinder the disassembly and, particularly,

needed to find the right screw for the right hole can be improved by standardising
screws so that same screws are used for all components in a phone. The extra added
value of screws themselves is that they can be reused in other phones.
Soldered components and cables

Soldering is used as a joining method for components and cables because it is relatively
strong and is electrically conductive. However, disassembly of soldered components
and cables is slow. Disassembly can be done by heating the solder, which adds to the
cost, energy, equipment and skill requirement of disassembly.
Breakable snap-fits and bosses

Breakable snap-fits are useful for quick removal of components when material reclaim
is intended. However the use of breakable snap-fits hinders reassembly as parts cannot
return to the same secure position they occupied prior to disassembly. Coupled with
this, the broken pieces of snap-fit may hinder the reassembly by preventing the correct
location of the component.
Plastic melt rivets

Plastic melt rivets provide a fast, easy and secure method of attaching a plastic component to another part. Upon disassembly, however, the melted plastic is difficult to
remove and typically must be broken in order to separate the parts, thus rendering the
riveted part unusable and condemning it to material reclaim.
Glue and solder

The use of adhesive paste to aid the bond strength of solder joints may be effective,
but it does not help disassembly. In order to disconnect the soldered component
(for example a speaker - easily reusable with a stable technology), the connecting
wires must be cut, thus shortening these wires and decreasing the likelihood of the
component fitting into similar phones.
Spot welding

Spot welding provides and fast and very strong means of joint between two metal
components of the same material, however disassembling such a joint is almost impossible without causing damage to the involved components. Thus the components are
likely to become candidates for material recovery.
Double sided adhesive

Double sided adhesive provides a strong bond and prevents the movement of components
within a casing, thus providing a more premium feel to the product. Unfortunately this
tape must be cleaned off and replaced in order to reuse components as it will not readhere as when it was new.
Crimping of chip guards

The crimping of chip guards around IC clusters provides good protection and solid

these are made from very thin material which cannot easily be removed without
deformation of the component, making them very difficult to replace in the same state.
Thin breakable parts

Thin walled parts cause an issue as, though they are light weight and provide a physical
barrier between two sections within a phone, they are inevitably damaged upon disassembly. This limits the re-usability and enhances the case for recycling rather than reuse.
Differently sized batteries

Though all phone batteries are all made of either Li-Polymer or Li-Ion, all the batteries have
a different size and have a different location of the connectors which makes it difficult to reuse batteries. Phone batteries need to be disposed of according to the batteries directive.
Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs)

PCBs cannot usually be reused due to technological obsolescence, though high value
components or modern PCBs can be reused (with a lower performance expectation
that when new). Circuit boards consist out of a vast amount of materials and many of
them are extremely valuable as an example shown in Fig. 10. Typical materials and
metals used in circuit boards are:
 Epoxy (green PCB)
 Copper (tracks, connectors and coils)
 Gold (durable corrosion resistant connectors)
 Aluminium shields (protection)
 Plastic (packaging of chips)
 Tantalum (in capacitors)
 Ceramics (in capacitors)
 Carbon (in resistors)
 Silicon (in chips)

Guidance on improved design for End of Life of mobile phones
Improvements in design for End of Life based on practical disassembly
Printed Circuit Boards (PCBs)

Reusing the individual components of a circuit board is not recommended because it
takes time and energy to de-solder all the chips. De-soldering must be done manually because all phones are different and have a different circuit board. Therefore, in most cases,
it is best to grind the chips until a powder is obtained. This powder can then be sorted. It
is worth noting that if the value of an individual IC is high enough then it could be recovered for reuse on another PCB, though likely with a lower specification than when new.
Circuit boards consist of many different materials.
Joining methods

Spot welding, plastic-melt-rivets, non-durable snap-fits, adhesives and solder were some
of the joining methods encountered in the phone disassembly exercise that increased the

easier and quicker, cause less damage to components and hence less disposal of damaged
components. For reassembly, where different threaded fastener lengths are required,
colour coding could be used in order to identify the screw and its appropriate hole.
Furthermore, standardisation of screw head could reduce the complexity of tool set
required for disassembly. Avoiding the use of adhesive paste with solder would improve
the reuse-ability of speakers as wires would not need to be cut - the speakers could be
used again in similar phones. The reinforcement of breakable snap-fits and guide bosses
could help to lessen the damage caused to components upon disassembly.
Non-durable materials

Thin plastics and thin aluminium sections were encountered examples of nondurable materials that were likely to break due to disassembly. In order for these
components to survive disassembly they could be made slightly thicker. Although
it has to be noted that the use of thicker material increases the amount of material used, which in turn could be less sustainable. Therefore the use of thicker
materials to accommodate component recovery rather than material recovery (recycling) should be assessed per component in the design process. If the size and
shape of these sections could be standardised then the possibility of reuse could
be increased.
Location of components in the phone

Due to the age disparity of the phones disassembled in this exercise it is difficult
to make meaningful contribution to this issue, however it is notable that the location of components does vary on the phones that were disassembled for this
exercise. In general it would aid both assembly and disassembly if the location of
components, relative to the main body of the phone, was standardised. Currently
the location of batteries, LCDs, speakers and microphones are standard, but the
internal components such as CPU, memory etc. could be governed by some
standard in order to increase the familiarity of phones when disassembled.
Identification of components

The HTC Sensation 4G smartphone had component identifications and date of
manufacturing on many of its components, as indicated with the red boxes in
Fig. 9. Some of the identification was done with simple QR codes which referred
to specifications of the component on the manufacturer’s site. Proper identification
could significantly aid remanufacturing of mobile phones. A computerised database
could be used in order to catalogue the original expected performance of components, which could then be checked against the actual performance of used components, thus gauging the stage of life of the component.
General guidance
1. The casing of mobile phones could be reused if a) the size and shape of mobile
phones was standardised and b) the material was not prone to scratching.
Unfortunately this is not easily realisable a fashion dictates change in phone form
and size on a regular basis. Cases could be designed for material recovery; using as

means other than removable snap fits. This would ensure a pure material for
recycling and could also help disassembly.
The pace of technology of speakers has stagnated and thus speakers have the
potential to be reused. Speakers consist of plastic moving parts with a copper coil
and a permanent magnet.
Working cameras and camera flashes can be reused in reconditioned phones.
Depending on the quality of cameras, they could also be re-purposed in other
devices needing a camera or sold separately in DIY shops. This could be realised if
all cameras were available as discrete modules rather than being integrated into
more complex circuitry.
With the rise in popularity of educational electronics sets such as Arduino and
Raspberry Pi, LCD screens could be re-purposed and used, together with touch
digitisers, in conjunction with these products. This would help to educate younger
people about reuse. This, however, may be difficult to realise financially.
Gorilla glass is valuable and can be recycled or reused if it is in a good condition.
Data cables in good condition can be re-purposed in other devices. Reusing
data cables in new phones has a risk of non-working cables. Uncommonly sized
data cables or broken cables can be recycled. They consist of plastic and copper, when placed in an oven the plastic burns and the copper remains.
The vibrator consists out of a copper coil, a magnet, plastic and a stainless steel
weight. A vibrator can wear because it is a mechanical part. Therefore it is best to
recycle the material.
Phone chargers can be reused until they fail. It could be possible, with the ubiquity
of USB (except in Apple products), to stop the automatic distribution of new
chargers with every new phone. It is conceivable that almost all people who have
bought a phone in the past 5 years will have adopted the USB standard, thus new
chargers could be un-necessary. This could save thousands of tonnes of plastic,
conductive metals and circuitry components.
Both Micro USB and Micro SD have become very popular in both the mobile
phone market and other personal electronic markets such as digital cameras. It
would seem sensible to standardise both USB-based and SD-based (as well as SIMbased) modules for use in mobile phones, cameras, external hard drives etc. Using a
proprietary module would save on the wastage caused by the use of custom circuit
boards used in each mobile phone, camera etc. Thus the improvement could be
that the USB/SD/SIM module be reused rather than recycled.

Best practice EoL techniques following suggested improvements

Table 7 illustrates the change in EoL performance which could be achieved by applying
the improvements suggested in section 6.1. It can be seen that the use of component
recovery could be increased from 3 at present to 12 with the suggested improvements.
Conversely the material recovery requirement could fall from 11 to 5. These changes
could have wider effect than the mobile phone market, as the parallel markets of digital
cameras and external hard drives are only two of the other markets using micro USB
and micro SD, which could be modularised as previously discussed. Furthermore, the
non-supply of USB chargers could save further material and provide an extension to

Suggested mechanisms for improvements in WEEE

One suggestion, which could have a wide-reaching effect on the WEEE environment, is to
employ an open-access parts database. This database would be initially populated by new
component and product data from OEMs, but over time complemented by data from
remanufacturing centres. This data would be accessed using reference numbers and associated QR codes where appropriate - the benefit of QR codes being the ability of scanners
and smart phones to read them very fast. The data held on each component could be its
nominal performance data, such as voltages, resistances etc. at certain test points (perhaps
multiple for a product). The measurement of these values and comparison with nominal
performance data may be able to suggest the current performance of components or
products and thus, by extrapolation, the stage in its life cycle - whether it be close to the

Conclusion
With the amount of Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment (WEEE) being generated every year increasing at an accelerating rate, the management of electronic waste
(e-waste) has become an important global issue. The EU and China were considered to
be the best representation of global WEEE management approaches and were evaluated
to identify differences and commonalities in approach as well as the identification of
the current best practices. Common approaches stem from the 1989 Basel Convention
and EU Directives on WEEE and the Restriction of Hazardous Substances (RoHS)
which are used as the foundation of management policy around the world. Common
policies such as Extended Producer Responsibility and Environmental Targets are to be
considered good practice that provides guidance and motivation to ensure proper
management of WEEE. Practical End-of-Life (EoL) treatment processes, including
remanufacturing, reconditioning, repairing, recycling, repurposing, reusing and disposal
of e-waste were all investigated and studied in context of mobile phones. Five phones
were disassembled and evaluated based on their ease of disassembly and time for
disassembly and reassembly. For each of the removed component the material, weight,
joining method, ability to re-attach and damage of disassembly were identified and
noted down. Further analysis on how design for disassembly can be improved indicated
the use of reusable joining methods, durable materials that can survive disassembly and
identification of components by means of a QR code or otherwise. Suggestions were
given how design can be altered to accommodate component recovery as opposed to
material recovery, and a suggestion was made to create an open access data base where
all component data from OEMs and updated information about component performance can be found. Feedback provision would aid manufacturers, and component
information would increase the incentive of manufacturers to produce quality
components. Further research is required to investigate the viability of such a database.
