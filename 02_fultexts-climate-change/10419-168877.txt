environment, is both a negative factor and a vector of profoundly ecological policies and
strategies.
CUC (Capacity Utilization Coefficient) is an economic efficiency indicator due to the
interest of accommodation services suppliers to maximize their profit, by increasing the
number of booked accommodation units / rooms. With respect to accommodation units,
TAC represents the occupancy rate in a determined period of time (usually one year), being
calculated as a ratio between effectively used capacity (nights spent as multiplying the
arrivals by average stay) and the maximum accommodation capacity (operating capacity
quantified as the result between existing capacity and the number of functioning days) and
the results are expressed in percentages.
The CUC social efficiency can be expressed through the total number of tourists’ arrivals,
which is the degree in which the population enjoys the benefits of tourism. The CUC
answers the ecologic dimension of development since it depends on the average stay – its
increase determining the decrease of the pollution degree caused by transportation, as well
as on the number of tourists – as the balance between demand and offer mitigates the issue
of seasonality.
The choice of CUC as an aggregate indicator of tourism dimension is explainable due to its
importance in the analysis of tourism activity efficiency from the economic, social and
ecological perspectives.
The brief content of the article sections is the following: an introductory chapter, a second
part dedicated to studying the specific literature, a third part presenting the methodology
used by the authors, and a fourth part describing the research results, containing the
analysis and necessary explanations. Finally, the article emphasizes the conclusions,
limitations and possible further research directions.
1. Literature review
Sustainable development is defined as a guarantee of the present needs without
compromising the next generations’ capacities of satisfying their own needs (Brundtland
Commission, 1987). Within the European Union, of which Romania has become a member
in 2007, there is a permanent preoccupation for sustainable development: approaching the
concept (European Union, 1998), elaborating an integrated strategy (European Commision,
1999) and adopting the Sustainable Development of the European Union Strategy
(European Commision, 2001).
The quantification of sustainable development is one of the constant preoccupations of the
organizations and researchers specialised in this field. The complexity of this phenomenon
is rooted in the large number of indicators that make up the aspects of life: economic,
social, ecological indicators as well as linkage indicators of human capital, the environment
and economic.
In a study performed by “The Macaulay Institute”, White et al (2006) have offered
examples of sets of indicators proposed by various national and international organisations.
The United Nations has proposed a set of 58 indicators, on 15 themes and 38 subthemes,
focussed on four components of sustainable development: social, environmental, economic
and institutional. In its sustainable development strategy, the European Union monitors
social inclusion, demographic changes, public health, climate changes and energy,
sustainable transport, natural resources, global partnership and governance.
Křupka et al (2011) have analysed the de sustainable development indicators from the
“Society, Human, Health” and “Stable and Safe Society” axes from the Czech Republic
Sustainable Development Strategy.
Based on the expert discussions, we defined a set of “safety” region indicators (six basic
and three super-structural indicators): Number of beds; Accessibility of health care;
Number of places in the social care facilities; Number of preschool facilities; Number of
offences, from the disclosed cases; Number of households connected to the Internet;
Number of accidents, injuries and death; Number of completely built flats; Number of
cultural, sport and other facilities. (Křupka et al, 2011)
Ivanovic et al (2009) have defined the main characteristics of efficient sustainable
development indicators: their relevance in relation to the proposed objective, the extent to
which the public understands them, the accuracy of information and access to statistics.
In the document dating from 1999, the European Union showed integrated strategy of
environmental politics and sustainable development through the document known as
European Spatial Development Perspective (ESPD) and it defined three groups of target
aims (Ivanovic et al, 2009):
• Economic competence and sustainable economics.
• Cohesion of the society and spatial equality (levelled intergeneration development).
• Protection of natural resources and natural environment (water and biodiversity
above all).
Light and Dumbraveanu (1999) have analysed the development of tourism in Romania
throughout 1989 - 1997.
Gonzalez and Moral (1996) have performed a quantitative study, by analysing the evolution
of international tourism.
Blake et al (2008) have studied the effects of tourism on the poverty rate and the way in
which the tourism industry influences the economy of a country, respectively certain
sectors of it.
Dolnicar, Yanamandram, Cliff (2012) have studied the role of vacations and tourism in
general on consumer satisfaction and quality of life. They propose that vacations should
become a distinct field in the methodology related to measuring the quality of life. McCabe,
Johnson (2013) extended the debates, by demonstrating the contribution of tourism to the
enhancement in the quality of life.
The level of CUC measures the way in which the material resources are exploited.
Concurrently, it also suggests the tourists’ possibilities of finding accommodations that
coincide with their requirements (regarding the comfort level, the price); from this
perspective, the indicator allows for the characterisation of social efficiency provided by
hotel services. Its role is even more complex, seeing as its scale is the pre-requisite for
attaining the other indicators of tourism activity. (Minciu, 2004)

The average duration of the stay represents the average number of tourists’ days of stay in a
certain area (country, resort etc.); it is the result of the ratio between the number of nights
spent and the number of tourists (Minciu, 2004).
The number of tourists is unanimously recognised as one of the most representative and
important indicators of tourist traffic (Minciu, 2004).
“There are few economic phenomena that significantly depend on a sole factor. The more
frequent situation is that in which the level of the economic phenomenon is the result of
several important factors added to the role of lesser-known, presumably insignificant
factors” (Pecican, 2006).
“Within the multiple model for variable dependent regression, designated with Y, it is
explained by a set of explained variables or regressors” (Andrei, Bourbonnais, 2008).
Song, Witt and Jensen (2003) have evaluated some linear regression models used for the
tourism demand estimations. On the same subject, Croes and Vanegas Sr. (2005) have
analysed econometric models that explain the flows in international tourism.
According to Sinclair and Stabler (1997), the advantages of the use of single equations
model are three-fold (Croes, Vanegas Sr., 2005):
• it provides useful information through the estimation of elasticities (which could
be useful information regarding the marginal utility and total revenues of a destination);
• the elasticity value can be calculated over time, thus providing information about
the adjustment time period required for any countervailing policy to have effects;
•

the elasticity can be estimated for different products and profiles of customers.

Kulendran and Witt (2001) have criticized the use of estimates based on the regression
models, characterising them as mediocre and unadjusted to the current economic
transformations.
Thrane and Farstad (2011) have used non-linear models to explain the relationship between
tourism expenses and the average stay. The results show that the generally positive length
of stay– expenditures relationship becomes weaker for trips of longer duration. That is,
length of stay has a diminishing positive effect on personal tourism expenditures.
(Thrane and Farstad, 2011)
2. Research methodology
The research approached two stages: 1) testing linear multiple regression models;
2) choosing and explaining the statistical-mathematical relationship and the influences
between the variables.
Original econometric models exposed here have rigorously passed through itemized stages,
parameters system, testing and decision (emphasizing validation).Thus, the stationary
character of data series had been tested by using the Dickey Fuller test. The estimate of the
parameters used the least squares method, pursuing in final models, the achievement of
high values of determination ratio(R2 shows the percentage that explains the influence of
significant factors, while R2 adjusted represents the corrected value of R2, a possible

used in the model were t-student (with the null hypothesis H0: the coefficients are not
significantly different to 0 and the alternative hypothesis H1: the coefficients are
significantly different to 0, the F test (verifies whether at least one coefficient is
significantly different to 0, null hypothesis H0: all coefficients are not significantly
different to 0, H1: there is at least one coefficient different to 0, the Durbin-Watson test is
used for correlation of the model error, the Jarque-Bera test is used, for testing whether the
errors of the model follows or not a normal distribution and the White test for testing the
homoscedasticity or heteroscedasticity of economic model.
For the 1990-2012 period the following data series have been used (according to Appendix
1): tourism indicators – Capacity Utilization Coefficient (CUC, occupancy rate, expressed
as a percentage, %), number of tourist arrivals in Romania, the average stay (nights
spent/arrivals); economic indicators – GDP per capita increase/decrease rate (%), real wage
indexes (%), annual inflation rate (%); social indicators - crime rate (number of registered
and solved crimes per 100,000 inhabitants), schooling rate (school enrolment rate of the
school-aged population), life expectancy upon birth (years); ecological indicators: the gas
emissions (greenhouse gas, thousand tons), alternative and nuclear energy (percentage from
the total used energy), protected areas (terrestrial and marine, % percentage of total).
The data has been collected by the authors from sources as: the National Statistics Institute
(insse.ro) - CUC, tourists’ arrivals, nights spent, the real wage indexes, school enrolment
rate, crime rate, the annual rate of inflation or World Bank (data.worldbank.org) - GDP per
capita increase/decrease rate, life expectancy upon birth; World Database on Protected
Areas (www.wdpa.org): percentage of protected areas; National Bank of Romania (bnr.ro):
annual inflation rate.
In order to identify a viable regression model, several scenarios have been tested, with
tourism indicators as the endogenous variables and economic, social and ecological
indicators as the exogenous variables. The main stages were: choosing the dependent
variable and the independent variables, testing the data series stationary system, their
stationarization, the estimation of parameters, testing the model hypotheses and the
interpretation of results.
The dependent variables which were taken into consideration: CUC, the number of arrivals
and average stay, and independent variables were - GDP per capita increase/decrease rate,
real wage indexes, annual inflation rate, crime rate, and schooling rate, life expectancy
upon birth, gas emissions, the alternative energy and the protected areas. (Table no.1)

In the last stage, the regression equations obtained from the original econometric models
and economic perspectives were interpreted, based on statistical, mathematical and
economic methods.
3. Results and comments
The first regression model proposed associates five variables, a dependent one: Capacity
Utilization Coefficent (CUC) and four independent ones: two economic indicators GDP/inhabitant increase rate (gdp_inhab) and inflation rate (r_inf), respectively two social
indicators - life expectancy upon birth (expectancy_n) and schooling rate (schooling).
In order to test the stationarity, we have used the Dickey-Fuller test for all five variables.

For the CUC, gdp_inhab, expectancy_n and schooling variables, the values of t-statistic are
higher than the critical value for 1%, 5% and 10%, and the associated probabilities (pvalue) are higher than 5%, therefore the null hypothesis is accepted – the series hava a
unitary root (are non-stationary). For the gdp_inhab variable, t-statistic is lower than t-critic
for 5% and 10%, with the associated probability smaller than 5%, but due to the small
number of observations, we accept that the series is stationary.
Non-stationary series have been stationarized by making the difference, in the case of the
expectancy_n variable twice (second-order integration), and then they were tested in the
same manner (the newly-generated series were called d_tcc, d_gdp, d_schol, respectively
d_ expectancy2). (Table no. 3)

For each one of the variables tested, t-statistic is smaller than t-critical, p-value associated
<0.05, therefore the null hypothesis is rejected and the alternative hypothesis is accepted,
thus the series do not have unitary roots, and they are consequently stationary.
The multiple linear regressions which specify the econometric final model will have the
following form:
d_tcc = c(1) + c(2)*d_gdp + c(3)*d_ expectancy2 + c(4)*r_inf + c(5)*d_schol

The values of t-student for the parameters are calculated in the t-Statistic column. If the
value Prob. <0.05, the null hypothesis is rejected: the variables parameters differ
significantly from 0.

By analysing T statistics we observe the following:
• Probabilities for d_gdp and d_schol are <0.05, therefore the null hypothesis is
rejected, the alternative hypothesis is accepted, the coefficients are significantly different
from 0
• Probability for d_ expectancy2 has the value of 0.55, and for r_inf it is 0.10, fitting
into the area of indecision, due to the small number of observations the null hypothesis can
be rejected, thus accepting the alternative hypothesis, their coefficients being significantly
different from 0.
F-statistics for the proposed model F = 6.133643 with a probability of 0.003942
consequently, is accepted that the overall multiple linear regression model studied is valid.
The model passes the tests of self-correlation of errors according to the Durbin – Watson
(DW=2.13), to normal distribution of errors, according to Jarque-Bera (Skewness=0.01;
Kurtosis=2.51) and homoscedasticity according to White (F statistic=1.83, the associated
probability is 26%.
The economic model as parameter multiple regression is the following:
d_tcc = -0.04852626244 + 0.006562849147*d_gdp + 3.671668126*d_ expectancy2 - 0.0002328175624*r_inf + 2.025487769*d_schol
The determination ratio (R2 = 62%) shows the percentage that explains the influence of
significant factors. In other words, 62% of the d_tcc variation is explained by the variation
of d_gdp, r_inf, d_ expectancy2, d_schol. In order to stymie the mechanical increase of R2
caused by the number of variables in the regression, R-adjusted is used, its 52% value,
confirming the validity of the model.
For a 1% increase of d_gdp, d_tcc increases by 0.006563%, provided that the other
variables remain constant. For a 1% increase of r_inf, d_tcc decreases by 0.000233%,
provided that the other variables remain constant. For a 1% increase of d_ expectancy2,
d_tcc increases by 3.671668%, provided that the other variables remain constant. For a 1%
increase of d_schol, d_tcc increases by 2.025488%, provided that the other variables
remain constant. Thus, a positive evolution of GDP per capita (Meaning higher increasing
rate) and of the inflation rate (meaning its diminishing) provides benefits to tourism, by
enhancing the occupancy rate. Moreover, the improvement of results concerning social
dimension of sustainable development (life expectancy, schooling) generates positive
effects for tourism.
The econometric model 1 suggests an important connection between touristic activity
development and the society overall. Increased life expectancy expresses service
development in general and healthcare in particular. In the long term it causes an increase
in population, which by default will use the services of interest, including specific health
tourism. Spa tourism can be considered a form of tourism that helps increase another social
indicator characterizing specific quality of life and life expectancy.
Increasing enrolment rates generates desire for knowledge of the population, leading to
increased tourist demand it.
The second regression model proposed associates the CUC with three indicators of
sustainable development: economic - GDP/inhabitant increase rate (gdp_inhab), social - life

In order to test stationarity , the Dickey-Fuller test was used for all the four variables; the
results and stationarization for three of them have been presented in detail in the previous
model. (Table no. 5)

For the gas_emissions variable, the t-statistic value is higher than the critical value, and the
associated probability is higher than 5%, therefore the null hypothesis is accepted – the
series has a unitary root (is non-stationary). The series has been stationarized through
differentiation and the newly-generated series (d_emissions) was tested again. Since tstatistic is smaller than t-critical for 5% and 10%, with the associated probability smaller
than 5%, due to the small number of observations, we accept that the series is stationary.
The multiple linear regressions which specify the econometric final model will have the
following form:
d_tcc = c(1) + c(2)*d_emissions + c(3)*d_gdp + c(4)*d_ expectancy2

value <0.05, then the null hypothesis is rejected: the parameters of the variables differ
significantly from 0.
Through the T statistics analysis we observe:
• The probabilities for d_emissions and d_ expectancy2 are <0.05, therefore the null
hypothesis is rejected and the alternative hypothesis is accepted, the coefficients being
significantly different from 0.
• The probability for d_gdp has a value ranging between 0.05 and 0.10,
consequently in the area of indecision, and due to the small number of observations the null
hypothesis can be rejected, consequently the alternative hypothesis is accepted, the
coefficient being significantly different from 0.
F-statistic for the proposed model, F = 6.909774 with a probability of 0.003387.
Consequently, it is accepted the fact that the overall multiple linear regression model that
has been studied is valid.
The model passes the tests of self-correlation of errors according to the Durbin – Watson
(DW=2.13), to normal distribution of errors, according to Jarque-Bera (Skewness=0.01;
Kurtosis=2.51) and homoscedasticity according to White (F statistic=1.83, the associated
probability is 26%.
The economic model as parameter multiple regression is the following:
d_tcc = - 0.01897346072 + 0.6599584833*d_emissions + 0.00404104794*d_gdp +
+ 4.414847077*d_ expectancy2
The determination ratio (R2 = 56%) shows the percentage that explains the influence of the
significant factors. In other words, 56% of the d_tcc variation is explained by the variation
of d_emissions, d_gdp, d_ expectancy2. In order to stymie the mechanical increase of R2
caused by the number of variables in the regression, R-adjusted is used, its 48% value
confirming the validity of the model.
For a 1% increase of d_emissions, d_tcc increases by 0.66%, provided that the other
variables remain constant. For a 1% increase of d_gdp, d_tcc decreases by 0.004%,
provided that the other variables remain constant. For a 1% increase of d_ expectancy2,
d_tcc increases by 4.41%, provided that the other variables remain constant. If a positive
evolution of GDP and life expectancy are obviously beneficial for tourism, the model also
corroborates the “complicated” relation between this industry and environment: gas
emission increasing with greenhouse effect contributes to increasing CUC. The explanation
consists in the fact that social-economic activity generating polluting emissions induces the
increasing of economy and the result, long and medium term is the expansion of tourism.
From the multitude of indicators that express the economic, social and ecological model
two of this paper shows the direct link between tourism activity and GDP per capita, life
expectancy at birth and the emission of greenhouse gases.
GDP per capita of a country's economic development, its growth having positive effects

includes tourism.
explained by the authors and the Model 1. Over time, emissions have increased because of
a growth of economic activity and hence the interest. In order to achieve sustainable
development it is necessary to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, without reducing the
quality of life. The statistics of the last two decades confirm attention environmental issues,
seeing a slow reduction of gas emissions Romania.
Conclusions
Results confirm the impact of the work sustainable development through all its dimensions,
the tourist activity in Romania. In this respect, strategies, makers of our country must take
into account all facets of sustainability - economic, social and environmental - to achieve
their medium and long term objectives. Tourism, long considered "national priority" can
develop harmoniously only provided that all principles of sustainable development.
The first econometric model confirms the regulation of tourism in society, touristic activity
being the result of raising the standard of living and implicitly of life quality from
economic and social perspective. The second model enlarges tourism depending upon
social-economic factors together with ecologic dimension of sustainable development. All
in all, the results of this research validate through acknowledged econometric methods the
opinions according to which tourism and sustainable development have a privileged
position together.
In close connection to the further research directions, there are also subjective limitations,
which the authors have faced, concerning the indicators’ typology, number or form of
expression. For the future it is necessary the expansion of research by adding qualitative
variables. Next step can be represented by testing the models and, implicitly, performing a
comparative analysis with countries that are at the same level of social-economic
development as Romania.
