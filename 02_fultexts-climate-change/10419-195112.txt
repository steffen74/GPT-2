Introduction and literature review
Inventory system is very complex because it has many aspects that should be considered
to control the system beneficially. Managers always want to decrease the cost of the
inventory system and increase the customers’ satisfaction. So they should consider the
different aspects of their inventory system to become successful in today competitive



provide their order quantity in the right time they would wait to fulfill their orders. On
the other hand, the second group of customers is the ones that do not want to be patient
to fulfill their orders, or their requirement is critical and it should be accessible in the
right time. This group of customers does not wait for the vendor to fulfill their order and
choose other vendor. Besides, in reality the production is not always perfect so the
fraction of the products is imperfect. Some reasons of this imperfect production are longterm usage of machines, breakdowns of equipment and the problems related to the
labors; so by investing the amount of money to cope with this mentioned problems
producer can improve their production quality. Furthermore, in most of the researches
that model the inventory system setup cost is considered as constant though it can be
reduced by using of the initial investment. A periodic review inventory system updates
its inventory on a periodic base. In this model, the amount of product that is ordered is
different from each period and depend on the quantity of on hand inventory. The periodic
review model is used just in predetermined and certain times. This is called (R, T) model.
Variable R is the up to order level and variable T is predetermined intervals between two
cycle in inventory model. The order quantity is the difference between a maximum
quantity R and the amount on hand at the review time. Commonly, in (R, T) model, lead
time is assumed as constant but in the real world we know it is impossible. Silver [32]
was the first researcher that mentioned that some constant terms in inventory model
could be the decision variables to make the model closer to the real world such as setup
cost, quality improvement, cost reduction, demand, and lead time and lead time reduction. For the probabilistic inventory models in reality, managers should know the
distribution function of the demand during the lead time but it is really difficult to
determine the distribution exactly. So, it is really important for the managers and
researchers to model the inventory system without the data on the lead time demand
distribution function. Tersine [47] extended the model for inventory system that has four
various scenarios: lead time and demand are both constant, lead time is assumed as
constant and demand is assumed as variable, demand is assumed as constant and lead
time is assumed as variable, as well as demand and lead time are both assumed as
variables. Liao and Shyu [11] provided a probabilistic model for inventory system that
the order quantity considered as constant and the lead time is considered as a variable to
obtain the optimum value for it. Yang and Pan [50] provided a model for the inventory
system and considered the amount of money to improve the quality, also the lead time is
assumed as a deterministic decision variable. Ouyang et al. [20] provided a periodic
review inventory model with aiming for the reduction of lost sale. He also assumed that
the lead time is controllable. Ouyang et al. [21] developed the model provided by Yang
and Pan [50] by assuming shortages and considering reorder point as one of the
variables. Taleizadeh and Pentico [36] provided a model with multi-buyer, multi-product,
single-vendor, multi-chance constraint and uncertain demand by considering lead time as
a variable. Glock [6] provided a model for inventory system with single-buyer, singlevendor and uncertain demand. He assuming that the lead time is dependent on the lot
size, he includes also the time of production, transportation time and setup time. Sarkar
and Majumder [26] developed the model provided by Ouyang et al. with reduction of
setup cost. Sarkar et al. [27] provided a model for inventory system by considering

201

method for the newsboy model. He assumed that only the standard deviation and the
mean of the distribution function of the demand during the lead time are known. The
provided solution is very hard to comprehend that Gallego and Moon [5] made it very
easy to understand. Ouyang and Wu [17], Hariga and Ben-Daya [7], Ben-Daya and
Rauf [2] Ouyang et al. [18], Park [22] and Chuang et al. [3] provided different
inventory models with using distribution-free method and considering lead as variable.
They assumed that the lead time could be separated into n fractions that are independent with the fixed cost of crashing. [14]developed the model provided by [17]by
assuming reorder point as one of their variables. Wu and Ouyang [49] assumed that the
demand during the lead time has the normal distribution with imperfect production.
Moon et al. [15] developed the model provided by Ben-Daya and Rauf [2] with the
distribution-free method, considering also lead time, amount of items ordered and
reorder point are considered as variables. Sarkar et al. [27] provided a model for
inventory system with variable lead time and order quantity; also he considered
production as imperfect process and assumed that the demand during the lead time.
Sarkar et al. [27] provided a model for inventory system with economic producing
quantity and imperfect process for production that the imperfect products have an
exponential distribution. Sarkar et al. [28] extended a model for the inventory system
and they considered setup cost reduction and improving of quality with the constraints
of service level. Vidalis et al. [48] provided a model for inventory system for supply
chain with two-echelon, and uncertain lost sale items, demand and other distribution
function. Sarkar et al. [28] provided a model for inventory system with quality
improvement, considering discount for backordered items, controlling lead time by
assuming the distribution-free method and they considered demand as constant. Moreover some related research can be found in Shin et al. [31], Majumder et al. [12, 13],
Soni et al. [33], Kim and Sarkar [8, 9], Sarkar et al. [29], Majumder et al. [12, 13],
Sarkar et al. [29], Sarkar [24] and Sarkar [25]. In this research we provide the (R, T)
model with reducing setup cost and improving quality, partial backordering and inspection process. This research is the first one that considers all mentioned aspects of
inventory system simultaneously to obtain the closer model to the real world. In the
following section we define our problem and provide a model for it. We summarize the
related articles in Table 1.

Problem definition
In this research we consider some important assumptions to model the inventory
system. First of all, we assumed that there are two groups of customers according to
their necessity of their requirement. The first group includes the customers that they
want to fulfill their order at the right time that is expected. So when the vendor does
not provide their requirement at the right time they do not wait for the vendor and
choose another one. Unlike the first group, the second group is the customers that their
requirement is not too critical to change the vendor. Besides, as we know in every
production there are always some imperfect products because of the problem related to

To make a production with higher quality, additional investment could be a good way. The
production process is considered to be an in-control state at first. During the production
process, the process would go to an out-of-control state, and then it produces imperfect units
and continues till the entire products are produced (see, for instance, Porteus [23]). Additional
investment could be a good strategy to reduce the quantity of defective products during the
out-of-control state. Refer to Porteus [23], to make the process of production better and to
reduce the probability of out-of-control state we have:


S A ðAÞ ¼ Bln

In the basic inventory model the setup cost is considered as constant. By using investment,
the setup cost could be reduced in the model. We consider a logarithmic function for
investment (refer to Porteus [23]):
 
ϕ
S ϕ ðϕÞ ¼ bln 0
ϕ

0 < ϕ ≤ϕ0

ð2Þ

Hence, total investment that is used for improving the quality and reducing the setup cost is
computed as below:
S ðA; ϕÞ ¼ S A ðAÞ þ S ϕ ðϕÞ ¼ Y −BlnA−blnϕ
Y ¼ BlnA0 þ blnϕ0 ;

ð3Þ

0 < A ≤A0 ; 0 < ϕ ≤ϕ0

ð4Þ

After a long term production the system produce some defective items that is computed as
D2 Tϕ
2

(see Appendix) and the cost of changing an imperfect item with an perfect one is m, so,
2

the expected annual imperfect cost is computed as mD2 Tϕ (see Appendix). Furthermore it should
be considered that the particular cost for inspection of each product that is calculated as vD.
Also it should be noted that, there are two groups of customers that convert full backordering
to partial backordering because of being some impatient customers that prefer other vendors so
the particular fraction of backordered item become lost sale. All these mentioned assumptions
are provided as a cost function as follows: The cost function that is related to the backordered
items is calculated as below:

And the cost function that is related to the lost sales is calculated as below:

Now for obtaining Partial backordering model we use the backordered fraction parameter
so we have:
ATC ðA; T ; R; ϕÞ ¼ β 1 ATC backordered ðA; T ; R; ϕÞ þ ð1−β1 ÞATC lost


205

In this model the particular fraction of customers’ demand is fulfilled that is denoted by β:
β ¼ 1−

E ðX −RÞþ
DT

ð9Þ

We consider k as the term provided as follows to have three number of decision variables
instead of four ones, so we have:
k ¼ R−μLþT

ð10Þ

In real world, distribution function for the lead time is unknown. So, we are unable to
calculate the value of the expected shortages per cycle E(X − r). So, we use the min-max
distribution free approach as provided by Scarf [30] and then Gallego and Moon [5] simplified
it. So, the problem is provided as:
minmax F∈ F fATC ðA; T ; k; ϕÞg

ð11Þ

To obtain the least favorable distribution in F, we can use the following lemma in Gallego
and Moon [5].

So according to the above computations we show that the cost function is always positive definite
and the answers for the decision variables are the optimum ones. Now to obtain the optimum answer
for the decision variables and the cost function the below algorithm is provided:
Step1. Consider A = A0 andϕ = ϕ0.

for expected cost in a year can be calculated.

so the number of the headphones that are produced should not be fewer than the safety
stock. Also number of headphones should not be more than the particular number of
cellphones that is considered as reorder point which is assumed as variable. So the
inventory system of these orders follows the (R, T) inventory model. Additionally, in
each production there are always some defective products that should be considered in the
model. Because of the presence of defective items in the lot the manufacturer should
inspect the lot. According to his strategy the inspection process is considered as full
inspection in this research to recognize all the defective items from the perfect ones. After
the inspection process an additional cost is needed to replace the defective items with the
perfect ones. The mentioned cost is dependent on the number of defective items which
calculate in the model provided in this article. Furthermore, in each cycle there are some
customers that are not patient enough to wait for the vendor to buy the products from
him so the particular proportion of the backordered items become lost sales. We model
the mentioned inventory system according to our provided model in this article; We
consider A0=500, D = 500, B = 5800, b = 400, h = 20, v = 2, m = 4, ϕ0=0.0002,
μ=200, σ = 7, α = 0.1, β=0.8,β1=0.6,π1=1,π2=2. Now we provide the results obtained
from step1 to step5 in 20 repetitions in Table 2.
As we see the differences between the two last rows of Table 2 that are highlighted is not

noticeable so we set A=483 and ϕ=0.000004 according to the provided algorithm, also step 5

As we see above, in the case with considering A and ϕ as variables total cost is less than the
other case without considering A and ϕ as variables. Now we want to show how the sensitive
parameters B, b, α, h, β and β1 affect the total cost. We show the changes of the total cost
versus changes the mentioned parameters in Figs. 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 and provided in Table 3 as
below:
As we see in Fig. 2 the value of total cost decreases by increasing the value of B. The next

Conclusion

ATC

Inventory system could be work beneficially if it is modeled well and this aim is
accessible by considering important aspects of the system. Managers always want to
decrease the inventory cost and make the customers more satisfied so it is important for
them to pay attention to the different aspects of their inventory system to become
successful in today competitive global marketing. One of these aspects is related to the
customers that are separated to two groups according to their loyalty and necessity of
their requirement. The first group is the ones that their requirements are not critical. So

this group of customers would wait to fulfill their orders even in the situation that the
vendor does not provide their order quantity in the right time. On the other hand, the
second group of customers is the ones that are not patient to fulfill their orders, or their
requirement is critical and it should be accessible in the right time. This group does not
wait for the vendor to fulfill their order so choose another vendor. Besides, in reality the
production is not always perfect so the fraction of the products is imperfect that could be
the result of long-term usage of machines, breakdowns of equipment and the problems
related to the labors; so by investing the amount of money to cope with this mentioned
problems producer can improve their production quality. Furthermore, in most of the
researches that model the inventory system setup cost is considered as constant though it
can be reduced by using the initial investment. In this article we model the inventory
system according to the mentioned assumptions and the results show that the total cost is
lower than the case with just cycle length and reorder point as variables. We suggest
authors to investigate the quality improvement in the works of Taleizadeh et al. [38–46]
Taleizadeh [34], Taleizadeh and Nematollahi [35] and Taleizadeh and Pentico [37] as
