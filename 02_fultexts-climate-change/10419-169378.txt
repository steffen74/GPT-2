Introduction
China has achieved rapid economic growth at an average rate of almost 10 percent annually
over the past three decades. This economic success, however, comes at the cost of deterioration
of the environment. One of the most severe environmental problems that China is currently
facing is air pollution. For example, the State Environmental Protection Administration of
China (SEPA) reports that about 70% of the 300 cities in China fail to meet the air quality
standards set by the World Health Organization (WHO) and seven out of the ten most polluted
cities in the world are located in China. The World Bank estimates that the direct cost of air
pollution – such as acid-rain damage to crops, medical bills and job-loss from illness – ranges
between 8 percent and 12 percent of China’s GDP annually (World Bank, 2007). In addition, it
is estimated that, because of heavy air pollution, more than three million people die prematurely
each year and the average life expectancy is more than 5 years lower for residents in northern
China than those living in the south (Wang, 2007; Pope III and Dockery, 2013).
The Chinese government has made substantial efforts to reduce air pollution by introducing
various emission reduction measures such as environmental taxes/charges, pollution treatment
programs and even closure of inefficient power/industrial facilities. Moreover, under the 12th
Five-Year Plan (2011–2015), China has paid considerable attention to energy and climate
change issues and has established a new set of targets and policies for the plan period. The main
targets include a 16 percent reduction in energy intensity (energy consumption per unit of
GDP), an increase in non-fossil energy up to 11.4 percent of total energy consumption and a 17
percent reduction in carbon intensity (carbon emissions per unit of GDP). In 2015, however,
China still recorded the world’s largest increment in energy consumption for the thirteenth
consecutive year and became the world’s largest emitter of both carbon dioxide (CO2) and
sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions. Therefore, a fundamental question would be certain to arise
regarding China’s environment: what are the main determinants affecting air pollution in China?
A number of studies have sought to isolate the independent effects of various factors on air
pollution in China. Traditional specification of this subject includes a growth variable (i.e.,
income per capita) and investigates the environmental Kuznets curve (EKC) – an inverted Ushaped relationship between income per capita and certain types of pollutants (typically
measured by CO2 emissions). Then, as we glance through the literature more, we come across
empirical studies that claim that energy consumption could be an important determinant of
environmental outcomes and analyze the so-called income-energy-environment relationship.
Examples include, but are not limited to, Song et al. (2008), Jalil and Mahmud (2009), Baek et
al. (2009), Baek and Koo (2009), Jalil and Feridun (2011), Wang et al. (2011), Govindaraju and
Tang (2013), Michieka (2014), Qu and Yan (2014), Yuan et al. (2015), Wang et al. (2016) and
Li et al. (2016). The findings from these studies generally show that there is ambiguous
evidence in favor of the EKC for China – e.g., Baek et al. (2009) and Baek and Koo (2009) for
no evidence of the EKC, and Jalil and Mahmud (2009), Song et al. (2008) and Li et al. (2016)
for evidence of the EKC – and strong evidence that China’s growth in energy consumption
indeed causes environmental degradation (e.g., Song et al., 2008; Govindaraju and Tang, 2013;
Qu and Yan, 2014; Li et al, 2016).
Important but perhaps less widely recognized in the literature is the possibility that
corruption could be an important factor of air pollution in China because China’s deteriorating environment coincides with the soar of corruptibility. The fact is that domestic firms in China
use a bribe to lobby officials to lower the environmental standards. Although China’s
government vows to fight corruption, it appears that the level of corruption has constantly
increased over the past decade. For the years 2002 through 2009, for example, the people’s
procuratorates at all levels investigated more than 240,000 cases of embezzlement, bribery,
dereliction of duty and infringements on rights. In 2009 alone, more than 3,000 people were
punished for their criminal liability in offering bribes (Information Office of China’s State
Council, 2010). Thus, a corruption variable should be accounted for when estimating factors
affecting China’s deteriorating environment properly.
Up until now, many scholars have sought to address the impact of corruption on the
environment. Examples include, but are not limited to, Lopez and Mitra (2000), Damania et al.
(2003), Fredriksson et al. (2003), Fredriksson and Svensson (2003), Welsch (2004), He et al.
(2007), Cole (2007), Woods (2008) and Leitao (2010). Damania et al. (2003), for example,
examine the corruption-environment nexus in a panel data of developing and developed
countries, and find that corruption indeed reduces environmental policy stringency. He et al.
(2007) employ cross-country data and confirm the findings of Damania et al. (2003) in that a
higher level of corruption always reduces the quality of environmental regulation. Woods (2008)
reports that political corruption serves to systematically weaken state environmental programs
in the United States. However, attention of most studies has been on cross-country data when
investigating the corruption-environment nexus. Thus, the existing literature does not directly
address the issue in China. This observation has motivated us to conduct this line of research.
The main objective of this paper is to take a measure of corruption into account in a model
when examining the income-energy-environment relationship in China. Although China is
currently the world’s largest SO2 emitting country along with CO2 emissions, empirical studies
have paid little attention to SO2 emissions in their analyses. 1 Empirical focus is thus on
assessing the effects of corruption, income and energy consumption on SO2 emissions using
panel data of 29 provinces in China from 1999 to 2012. To that end, the panel cointegration
methods are utilized.
This paper is organized as follows: in Section II, we outline the empirical model to be
estimated and the data used for the estimation. In Sections III and IV our empirical procedures
and major findings are discussed, respectively. Finally, section V makes some concluding
remarks.


Methodology

2.1

The model to be estimated

In examining factors affecting a country’s environment, researchers generally rely on the socalled standard model of the income-energy-environment nexus (e.g., Iwata et al., 2010; Baek
and Kim, 2013; Baek, 2015). For the empirical model adopted here, we extend the incomeenergy-environment nexus to include a measure of corruption. Letting i denote the crosssectional unit (Chinese provinces in this paper) and t the time period, we can write a model in a
log-linear form as:
2
ln( so2 ) it = α + β1 ln yit + β 2 ln yit + β 3 ln ecit + β 4 corit + e it

(1)

where ( so2 ) it is the sulfur dioxide (SO2) emissions for province i in China; y it is the 2000 real
2
income for province i; y it is the square of the 2000 real income for province i; ecit is the energy
consumption for province i; corit is a measure of corruption for province i and is the number of
anti-corruption cases; and εit is the error term. 2 The variables are measured on a per capita basis.
We are particularly interested in the parameter β4 – that is, the ceteris paribus effect of
corruption on SO2 emissions.
Given that numerous studies commonly show the crucial role of income plays in influencing
environmental outcomes (e.g., Jalil and Mahmud, 2009; Iwata et al., 2010; Baek and Kim, 2013;
Baek, 2015; Li et al., 2016), it would be proper to directly test the Environmental Kuznets
Curve (EKC) hypothesis into our modeling. In Eq. (1), to the extent that β1>0 and β2<0, the
EKC hypothesis is predicted to hold; that is, income has a diminishing effect on SO2 emissions
after the turning point (or maximum point of the income), achieving a parabolic shape. It is
expected that β3>0 due to the fact that an increase in energy consumption mainly driven by
growth is likely to push SO2 emissions up. Finally, it is expected that β4<0 because the
increasing number of anti-corruption cases is likely to result in improved environmental
regulations, thereby reducing SO2 emissions.

2.2

Data

SO2 emissions are used as a proxy for a measure of air pollution. China is the world’s largest
coal consumer, accounting for about 50% of the world’s total coal consumption. Coal
combustion generates more than 90% of SO2 emissions in China. As a result, China currently
ranks the largest SO2 emitter worldwide. To ensure comparability with income per capita in Eq.
(1), the SO2 emissions per capita for individual provinces (measured in 10 thousand metric tons)
are calculated using their population size. The provincial gross domestic product per capita
(measured in constant 2000 Chinese Yuan) is used as a proxy for real per capita income for each
province. The energy consumption is measured in 10 thousand metric tons of coal equivalent
_________________________
2 It should be admitted that, since we use China’s provincial data in estimating Eq. (1), it would be more desirable to
control for many other provincial characteristics in the model. Unfortunately, however, the lack of data availability at
the provincial level prevents us from considering more control variables in Eq. (1).
per capita. The number of anti-corrupt cases is used as a measure of the degree of corruptibility
and is intended to allow for the likelihood that higher anticorruption efforts are likely to less
environmental degradation. 3 The data on SO2 emissions are collected from China
Environmental Statistical Yearbooks. All the remaining variables are from China’s Statistical
Yearbooks.
Our (balanced) panel dataset contains the 29 Chinese provinces from 1999 to 2012
(N*T=406 observations, where N=29 provinces and T=14 years). This time period is chosen by
availability of the data for all the variables. All variables are converted into natural logarithms.

Empirical results

The first requirement for estimating our model in Eq. (1) using the panel cointegration method
is that the variables must be nonstationary I(1) series. Accordingly, the panel cointegration
modeling normally starts with testing whether a panel series follows a unit root. However, the
possibility of cross-sectional dependence in panels is likely to invalidate the test statistics of
conventional panel unit root tests such as the LLC (Levin et al., 2002) and IPS tests (Im et al.,
2003). These tests commonly assume the cross-sectional independence in panels. Before
applying a unit root test, therefore, we must test whether a panel series is cross-sectionally
independent. A cross-sectional dependence (CD) test of Pesaran (2004) can be used to achieve
_________________________
3 The Chinese government has been making great efforts to combat corruption and to build a clean government using
the following four measures over the past decades. The first measure is to select officials on the basis of democratic,
open, competition, and preferred standards in order to prevent corrupted officials from being selected. The second
measure is to establish a sound law system and regulations against corruption. The third measure is to put the power
under the control by institutional innovation. The last is to build up a monitoring system including Chinese
Communist Party inner-party supervision, supervision of the National People's Congress, democratic supervision of
Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, government supervision, judicial supervision, civil supervision
and supervision by public opinion. Thus, anti-corruption cases should be relevant in using a proxy for corruption.
Some scholars (e.g., Damania et al., 2003; Cole, 2007) use governmental honesty taken from the International
Country Risk Guide (ICGR) as a proxy for corruption in their models. At the sub-national level, however, the data are
not available.

this goal. The results show that the null hypothesis of no cross-sectional dependence can be
strongly rejected (the p-values for all five variables are zero to two decimal places), providing
compelling evidence of the cross-sectional dependence in the sample (Table 2).
Given that the panel series are found to be cross-sectionally dependent, it is no longer
appropriate to use conventional panel unit root tests. Hence, we employ more powerful tests that
allow for cross-sectional dependence such as the cross-sectionally Im-Pesaran-Shin (CIPS) and
cross-sectionally augmented Dickey-Fuller (CADF) tests. 4 The CIPS test results show that we
cannot (can) reject the unit root hypothesis for the levels (first differences) of all series,
indicating that all five variables are I(1) processes (Table 3). The CADF test largely confirms
this finding, although we can reject a unit root in the level of corit ; when corit is differenced,
however, the null is strongly rejected and this leads us to believe that corit is I(1) variable. The
upshot of the unit root tests is that all five series in Eq. (1) appear to be nonstationary I(1)
processes.
When estimating a nonstationary panel model, there is serious concern about spurious
regression. In one important case, a regression estimating nonstationary I(1) series is not
spurious, and that is when the series are cointegrated. Hence, the presence of cointegration
relationship among the variables is tested using the various tests developed by Pedroni (1999
and 2004) and Kao (1999). The results show that the null hypothesis of no cointegration can be
rejected even at the 1% level of significance for all five tests, evidence that SO2 emissions and
its determinants have a long-run relationship (Table 4). In other words, whenever deviations
from the long-run equilibrium take place, they would be transient: there are economic forces
that drive SO2 and its main factors back to restore the long-run equilibrium relationship.
Having learned about a potential long-run relationship among the five series, we now apply
the FMOLS and DOLS panel estimators of Mark and Sul (2003) and Kao and Chiang (2001) to
Eq. (1) in order to estimate the long-run parameters. We also report the estimated effects of the
fixed effects (FE) estimator here for comparison.5

Discussion

Table 5 reports the long-run effects for all independent variables and for each of the three
estimated models. The estimates generated by the models seem remarkably consistent. The
signs of the coefficients are the same across models, and the same variables are generally
statistically significant in each model.
The coefficients on the income and the quadratic term are similar across models. Because
2
the coefficient on y it is always positive and the coefficient on y it is always negative, this
equation literally implies that, at low value of income, an additional rise in income tends to
increase SO2 emissions. At some point, the effect becomes negative, and the quadratic shape
means that the elasticity of SO2 emissions with respect to income is decreasing as income
increases. In other words, the finding seems to be supportive of the EKC hypothesis for Chinese
SO2 emissions. It turns out, however, that all of the 29 provinces in the sample have more than
the calculated turnaround values of income, and so the part of the curve to the left can be
ignored. Thus, SO2 emissions in fact have monotonically fallen with income growth in China
over the past decade. From policy perspectives, this result can be interpreted that the Chinese
government’s policies targeted to reducing air pollution are likely to work effectively without
costing economic growth.
The partial effect of energy consumption on SO2 emissions is always positive, and the
magnitudes of the coefficient estimates are very similar across all three models. In the FMOLS
model, for example, a one percent increase in energy consumption is estimated to increase SO2 emissions by about 0.80% in China. Given the fact that growth largely leads to an increase in
energy use, this finding suggests that any favorable growth effect on air pollution could be
offset by a detrimental energy consumption impact.
The key policy variable, corit , seems to have the desired effect. The estimated coefficient is
negative for all three models. The statistical significance is high for the FMOLS and fixed
effects, and lacking for the DOLS. For example, the FMOLS coefficient (–0.17) implies that,
for other things being equal, China can reduce SO2 emissions by about 0.17% as the number of
anti-corruption cases increases by one percent. To our knowledge, this is a new finding that has
not been documented yet in the empirical literature. As a policy matter, this suggests that
effective anti-corruption measures would improve the environment through the enforcement of
environmental regulations in China. From a methodological perspective, this finding explains
why the complementary features of different modelling approaches would be desirable to draw
more robust conclusion and thus better understand the corruption-environment nexus in China.
Finally, in addition to learning about the long-run relationship in Eq. (1), utilizing the notion
of causality enriches our understanding of the variables by providing causal inference (i.e.,
direction of causality). For completeness, therefore, the bootstrap panel Granger causality test
developed by Emirmahmutoglu and Kose (2011) is utilized. This method is most useful when
dealing with cross-sectional dependence in panels as we identify in our model. The results show
strong bidirectional causation for 4 cases and unidirectional causation for 5 cases (Table 6). For
example, the relationships between SO2 emissions and energy consumption, and SO2 emissions
and corruption are characterized by bidirectional causality. This means that SO2 emissions are
significantly affected by changes in energy consumption (corruption) and energy consumption
(corruption) is also influenced by changes in SO2 emissions. On the other hand, there is
unidirectional causality running from income to SO2 emissions. This suggests that SO2
emissions are significantly affected by changes in income, while income is not affected by
changes in SO2 emissions. Together, these findings provide evidence that all independent
variables can be used to forecast future SO2 emissions and justify the use of our model in Eq.
(1).

Concluding remarks

Although corruption can have an effect on the environment in China, no study has directly
addressed this issue empirically. In this short article, therefore, we take a corruption variable
into account in a dynamic panel model when estimating the income-energy-SO2 emissions
nexus. Our results show that anti-corruption cases seem to have a beneficial effect on reducing
SO2 emissions in China. Other findings show that income growth tends to lower SO2 emissions,
while energy consumption increases SO2 emissions.
