Usually, individuals want to pay kind acts with kindness and bad acts with
unkindness. This is known as fairness or reciprocity. Most models in economics
tend to ignore fairness or any other emotion despite its profound impact on
economic activity. For example, Rabin (1993) showed that consumers may not
consume a product (even if it is in their interest to do it) if they think its price is
unfair.1 Akerlof (1982) argues that workers repay high wages by giving a high effort
in their jobs. In the negative side, Krueger and Mas (2004) argue that after the
management of Firestone demanded concessions from the workers and hired
replacement workers during a strike, the workers responded by sabotaging the
products which resulted in 271 fatalities.
In his seminal paper, Rabin (1993) introduced fairness to game theory by
modeling how if one player believes that her opponent is sacriﬁcing her own
material payoffs to help her, then she may be willing to sacriﬁce her own material
payoffs as well to help her opponent in return; and if one player believes that her
opponent is treating her badly, she may sacriﬁce her own material payoff to treat her
opponent badly. As an example, Rabin shows how in the Prisoners’ Dilemma this
allows for a ‘‘fairness equilibrium’’ (FE from now on) in which both players play
‘‘cooperate’’ . Rabin’s model is deﬁned for two players in static games. Dufwenberg
and Kirchsteiger (2004) extended Rabin’s model to dynamic games for more
players with their solution concept of ‘‘sequential reciprocity equilibrium’’ (SRE
from now on).
However, these models assume that players do not care about the outcomes of
games in which they are not involved. In the real world individuals form emotions
of fairness based on the treatment of others and these emotions can affect the
outcome of their own games. For example, a mother may be nicer to someone who
is nice to her daughter. And in countless interethnic conﬂicts, individuals from each
of the groups involved have targeted innocent members of the other group to avenge
previous offenses. Less tragically, individuals sometimes buy products at a higher
price or of subpar quality solely because those products come from ﬁrms owned by
their fellow countrymen or by members of their own ethnic group.
The aim of this paper is to analyze the relationship between the outcome of
seemingly independent games (those games in which the players of one game are
different to the players of the others), stemming from the emotions of fairness and
reciprocity. For this, we extend Dufwenberg and Kirchsteiger (2004)’s model of
reciprocity, in which individuals want to reciprocate the kindness or unkindness of
other individuals, to a more comprehensive model that incorporates a sense of
fairness that depends on the payoffs of other members of our own groups.
Other economists have developed other models of reciprocity. Falk and
Fischbacher (2006), Levine (1998), Fehr and Schmidt (1999), and Bolton and
Ockenfels (2000) are some examples. However, we focus in Dufwenberg and
1

Kahneman et al. (1986) showed that individuals evaluate the fairness of an increase in the price of a
product as fair or unfair, depending on the motives of the increase. Individuals consider an increase in the
price of a product due to a higher demand as unfair and consider an increase in the price of a product due
intentions is essential to represent the idea of group reciprocity.
The contribution of this article is to extend the concept of reciprocity with the
following three stylized facts:
1.

2.

3.

Individuals want to increase the material payoffs of those individuals who
belong to the same groups as them and are willing to sacriﬁce their own
material payoffs in order to do it.
Individuals treat more kindly those individuals who have been kind to other
individuals who are close to them and individuals treat more unkindly those
individuals who have been kind to other individuals who are close to them.
The acts of kindness or unkindness of some members of a group can create
sympathy or resentment towards all the members of their group and a desire for
reciprocity towards each of these, even those who played no part in the original
acts.

We develop a game theoretic framework that incorporates these facts. In Sect. 2, we
present evidence that support the stylized facts of our model. We review both
empirical and experimental evidence.
In Sect. 3, we introduce our model by extending Dufwenberg and Kirchsteiger
(2004)’s model of sequential reciprocity to groups of individuals. We deﬁne a utility
function that represents all three stylized facts mentioned above and deﬁne a new
solution concept which we call ‘‘sequential group reciprocity equilibria’’.
In Sect. 3.1, we probe the existence of our solution concept in Theorem 1.
Although the proof is in ‘‘Appendix’’, we give a brief explanation of the proof. In
Sect. 3.1.1 we mention the differences between our model and the FE and SRE.
In Sect. 3.2, we develop an example to show the relation that the outcome of one
game has over the outcome of other games, due to emotions of group reciprocity. To
show the interaction between groups of individuals, we work with the easiest case:
two games of two players and two groups with two members. One of the members
of each group play in each game. We get the following basic results:
First, as the material payoffs of one game grow arbitrarily large, the outcome of that
game dominates the emotions of reciprocity of the players who play in the other game. In
the sequential group reciprocity equilibria, if the outcome of the game with arbitrarily
large payoffs is positive and both players are kind, the emotions of the players in the
other game are going to be positive and they will be kind also in their own game. In the
sequential group reciprocity equilibria, if the outcome of the game with arbitrarily large
payoffs is negative and both players are unkind, the emotions of the players in the other
game are going to be negative and they will be unkind also in their own game.
Second, in the sequential group reciprocity equilibria, when the material payoffs of
one game become arbitrarily small, the sign of outcome of that game is the same as
the sign of the outcome of the other game players in the game in which payoffs are
small are kind only if players in the other game are kind and unkind if players in the
other game are unkind. These two results are based on the same idea. If the stakes in
one game are much higher in one game in relation to the other, the outcome of that
individuals can greatly reward or punish their opposing players with little cost to
themselves), the outcome in which the sum of the material payoffs is maximized
is a sequential group reciprocity equilibrium. This result is very optimistic as it
concludes that in the outcome where the sum of the material payoffs is being
maximized, nobody wants to deviate (even if they can increase their own
material payoffs by doing it). The reason is that in this case, the emotional
payoffs is positive, in fact very positive, and even the players who can increase
their material payoffs by deviating, prefer to maximize their emotional payoffs
instead and being kind (as their partners are being treated nice, in fact, very
nice).
Fourth, in the case where one game is played ﬁrst and then the other, and the
material payoffs of the games are asymmetric enough, we ﬁnd that the
sequential group reciprocity equilibrium is that in which the outcome in which
the sum of the material payoffs of the players is maximized. The reason for this
is that the player in the ﬁrst period than can be very kind or unkind, wants to be
nice to her opposite in order for her own partner to be treated nicely in the
second period.
Finally, in Sect. 4, we conclude and discuss possible extensions.

2 Evidence
There is evidence that individuals often treat better other members of their own
groups. Tajfel et al. (1971) show that individuals favor members of their own group
when distributing rewards and penalties in situations in which irrelevant classiﬁcations distinguished between the in-group and the out-group. Ayres and Siegelman
(1995) show that black buyers of new cars are offered higher prices than white
buyers in dealerships in the Chicago area. Zussman (2013) ﬁnds that Arab buyers
and sellers in the Israeli online market for used cars are discriminated against. Price
and Wolfers (2010) ﬁnd that referees in the NBA award more personal fouls to
players of their opposite race. Chen and Li (2009) show that individuals are not only
more altruistic, but also they have less envy towards members of their own groups
and when matched with in-group members, are more likely to choose social welfare
maximization outcomes. Mitchell et al. (2005) shows that mock jurors tend to
decide in favor of individuals who share their ethnicity and were more likely to give
longer sentences for other race defendants.
Additionally, there is evidence that individuals evaluate the kindness of a
person, taking into consideration how that person has treated other individuals,
specially those who are close to them. Fehr and Fischbacher (2004), Engelmann
and Fischbacher (2008), Nowak and Sigmund (1998), and Nowak and Sigmund
(2005) show that individuals want to help/punish those individuals who are kind/
unkind towards other individuals. Goette et al. (2006) show that individuals who
platoon and when they were given the opportunity to punish defection of third
parties punished more harshly if the defection affected a member of their own
platoon.
Finally, there is evidence that the kindness or unkindness of individuals creates
sympathy or resentment towards all the members of their group and a desire for
reciprocity towards them, even those who played no part in the original acts. HughJones and Leroch (2010, 2011) show experimentally that individuals who were
harmed by an individual reacted by harming other member of that individual’s
group. Shayo and Zussman (2011) ﬁnd that judges in Israel treat more favorable
members of their own ethnic groups, and this bias increases after a terrorist attack in
the vicinity of the court. Edwards et al. (2007) show that consumers in New Zeland
and Australia reacted to the French Nuclear Test in the south paciﬁc in the mid1990s ﬁrms by reducing their consumption from French ﬁrms. Michaels and Zhi
(2010) ﬁnd that American ﬁrms’ willingness to pay for French inputs decreased
after France did not support American efforts to obtain UN Security Council
mandate to use military force against Iraq and American imports from France could
have being reduced for this reason for as much as 15%.

3 Model
Our model is deﬁned for dynamic games with perfect information. Ai is the set of
Q
strategies (possible mixed) for player i and A ¼ i2N Ai is the set of strategy
proﬁles for all players. ai 2 Ai is a strategy for individual i, bij 2 Ai are the beliefs of
individual i regarding the strategy of individual j and cijk 2 Ai are the beliefs of
individual i about the beliefs of the individual j about the strategy of player k
(second order beliefs). Strategy ai ðhÞ is the same as strategy ai , but playing history h
with probability one. pi : A ! R are individual i’s ‘‘material payoffs’’. H is the set
of the histories of the game and N is the set of the players in the game.
Let Si be a partition of N. Partition Si represents the different groups a player can
belong according to player i. By allowing for different partitions for different
players we are allowing for each player to have different beliefs of what the groups
are. For example, conceivable, it can happen that a player believes to belong to a
group, while others players do not believe it.
We ﬁrst deﬁne what an equitable payoff is and use it as a reference point to
evaluate the kindness of a strategy. We only look for the equitable payoffs in the set
of efﬁcient strategies. A payoff that is not efﬁcient cannot be equitable, given that
the player is giving a lower payoff to the opposing player without any beneﬁt to
herself. We deﬁne a player’s strategy as efﬁcient if there is no other strategy that
always gives every player a higher or equal payoff, with strict inequality for at least
one player. Because we require that at the equilibria all players maximize at every
Ei ¼

ai 2 Ai j there exists no a0i 2 Ai such that for all h 2 H; ðaj Þj6¼i 2

and m 2 N; we have that pm ða0i ðhÞ; ðaj ðhÞÞj6¼i Þ ! pm ðai ðhÞ; ðaj ðhÞÞj6¼i Þ;
)
with strict inequality for at least one ðh; ðaj Þj6¼i ; mÞ :
Ei is the set of strategies for player i that cannot improve any player at any history
without making another player worst off. As the FE and the SRE, we deﬁne the
equitable payoff as the average of the highest and the lowest of the payoffs in the set
of the efﬁcient strategies.
Deﬁnition 1 the ‘‘equitable payoff’’ for individual j at history h is given by the
following equation:

We use the equitable payoff as a reference point to evaluate the kindness of a
strategy. We propose that a strategy that provides an opponent a higher payoff than
the equitable payoff be evaluated as kind and a strategy that provides an opponent
with a lower payoff than the equitable payoff be evaluated as unkind. The following
function represents how kind an individual believes she is to her opponent.
Deﬁnition 2 the kindness of player i towards player j when playing strategy ai is
given by:




fij ai ðhÞ; ðbim ðhÞÞm6¼i ¼ pj ai ðhÞ; ðbim ðhÞÞm6¼i À pe ððbim ðhÞÞm6¼i Þ:
j

We refer to fij as the kindness function. We would evaluate the strategy of player
i as kind if the kindness function is positive, as the kindness function of player i is
positive only when she is sacriﬁcing her own material payoffs to increase the
material payoffs of player j. The more positive the kindness function is, the higher
the material payoff player i is giving to player j and the kinder we would evaluate
player i to be. We would evaluate the strategy of player i as unkind if the kindness
function is negative as the kindness function of player i is negative only when she is
sacriﬁcing her own material payoffs to decrease the material payoffs of player j. The
more negative the kindness function is, the lower the material payoff player i is
giving to player j and the unkinder we would evaluate player i to be.
Now, we deﬁne a function that represents how kind a player considers other
when she believes she is playing strategy bij is given by:

player at other histories. For example, in the Prisoners’ Dilemma, shown in Fig. 1
the utility of player 2 at history D, depends not only on the strategy of player 1, but
also on her own action at history C.
Dufwenberg and Kirchsteiger prove instead the existence of the SRE by
maximizing each player’s utility at every history in which they play, given not only
the strategies of the other players, but also their own actions at other histories. They
form a correspondence from the union of the best replies of every player at every
history and apply Kakutani’s ﬁxed point theorem to prove that this correspondence
has a ﬁxed point. This is an equilibrium as no player can improve at any particular
history by changing their actions on that history.
Theorem Every ﬁnite extensive game with perfect information has a Group
Fairness Equilibrium.
The proof of theorem 1 is in the ‘‘Appendix’’.
Our proof of existence follows Dufwenberg and Kirchsteiger (2004) proof of
existence of their concept of sequential reciprocity equilibrium by proving that there
is a sequential group reciprocity equilibrium where players maximize their utility at
every history simultaneously using Kakutani’s ﬁxed point theorem.

There are a few differences between our solution concept and the FE and the SRE.
1.

2.

3.

4.

The ﬁrst difference is that our solution concept includes the concept of SRE, but
extends it for reciprocity between the members of different groups. The ﬁrst
term inside the absolute value in our utility function is the equivalent to the
utility function used in the SRE. It is in the second term where our concept
differs from the SRE by including the emotion of reciprocity for the treatment
of other members of our own groups. If, for example, ki ¼ 0; our solution
concept is equivalent to the SRE.
The second difference is that our solution concept includes an absolute value
instead of the multiplication of the fairness functions, as the FE and the SRE do.
The reason for this is that we want to represent that players want to reciprocate
a kind or unkind act with the same intensity, unlike the FE and the SRE that
make the extreme assumption that players want to reciprocicate a small offense
with the highest possible punishment.
As the SRE, we do not normalize the reciprocity part of the utility function as
the FE does. We do this for simplicity, as our utility function is complicate as it
is now. This also allows us to prove the existence of our solution concept, as our
utility function is continuous. The utility function of the FE is discontinuous,
and therefore it cannot prove its existence.
Unlike the FE and the SRE, we include the material payoffs of the other
members of the group of each player in the utility function. This allows us to
represent that individuals not only want to reciprocate against kind or unkind
acts against members of their groups, but also they have the emotion of
altruism, especially with members of their own group.

3.2 Basic results
While most economists have assumed that players only care about what happens in
the games they play, our model assumes that players take into consideration also the
interaction of players in other games if they belong to their groups. Our aim is to
model how the outcome in one game may affect the outcome of other games.
In this section, we analyze the case of two games with two players in each game
and two groups with two members in each group. One of the members of each group
plays in each game. To be concise, we will refer to the other member of an
individual’s own group as her ‘‘partner’’ and the person an individual is playing
against as her ‘‘opponent’’.
We analyze the relationship that exists between the outcomes of two seemingly
independent games. As Rabin (1993), we study games where the material payoffs
may be arbitrarily small or arbitrarily large. For this, we consider a set of games that
are exactly the same, with the exception of the scale of their material payoffs. Let G
be the set of games that consists of the set of players N, where N ¼ f1; 2; 3; 4g; the
game that corresponds to the given values X and Y.
Given that the material payoffs for each player depend solely on his or her own
strategies and those of their opponents, we can think of each game G(X, Y) as a
game composed of two materially independent games, one made up of players 1 and
2 and the other made up of players 3 and 4. Let G1 be the set of games that consists
of players 1 and 2 and strategies A1 and A2 , and material payoffs X Á p1 ða1 ; a2 Þ and
X Á p2 ða2 ; a1 ÞÞ. Let G1 ð X Þ 2 G1 be the game that corresponds to a given value of X.
Let G2 be the set of games that consists of the set of players 3 and 4, the set of
strategies A3 and A4 , and the payoff functions Y Á p3 ða3 ; a4 Þ and Y Á p4 ða4 ; a3 Þ: Let
G2 ðY Þ 2 G2 be the game corresponding to a given value of Y.
Given that a game G(X, Y) is composed of games G1 ðXÞ and G2 ðYÞ, we
sometimes refer to G(X, Y) as ‘‘the composite game,’’ to G1 ðXÞ as ‘‘single game 1’’,
and to G2 ðYÞ as ‘‘single game 2’’. We refer to the set of players of single game 1 as
N1 and to the set of players of single game 2 as N2 :
Our intention is to identify the outcomes where all players are being kind or
unkind. To do so, we rewrite one of the Rabin’s deﬁnitions. Rabin (1993) works
with a single game; hence, his deﬁnitions are for a single game only. Rabin deﬁnes
the outcome of a game as a function of the sign of the kindness function of both
players. The outcome of a game is positive if both players are kind to each other and
negative if both players are unkind to each other.
Deﬁnition 6 For a single game m: (a) an outcome is strictly positive if for all
i; j 2 Nm ; j 6¼ i; we have fij [ 0; (b) an outcome is weakly positive if for all i; j 2
Nm ; j 6¼ i;we have fij ! 0; (c) an outcome is strictly negative if for all i; j 2 Nm ; j 6¼ i;
we have fij \0and (d) an outcome is weakly negative if for all i; j 2 Nm ; j 6¼ i; we
have fij 0:
For some results, we want to allow individuals to be nice to each other if they
choose to be. However, this is not possible in every game. For example, in the battle
of the sexes, an individual cannot be kind to his or her opponent, given that when a
person maximizes their opponent’s material payoffs, they are maximizing their own
material payoffs as well. We deﬁne a game where all individuals can be kind in
every possible situation as a kind-game.
Deﬁnition 7 A kind-game is a game where ph ðai Þ À pli ðai Þ [ 0for every ai 2 Ai
i
and for every i 2 N:
A kind-game is a game where all players always have the possibility of being
nice to their opponents, as in the Prisoners’ Dilemma. This deﬁnition excludes
games such as the battle of the sexes, where players do not make any sacriﬁce when
they maximize their opponent’s material payoffs.

Game 2 G2 ðYÞ
Example 1 In the next two propositions, we analyze the properties of the
sequential group reciprocity equilibria when the material payoffs of a single game
change while the material payoffs for the other single game remain the same. In
Proposition 1, we analyze the case where Y grows arbitrarily large while X remains
constant and in Proposition 2, we analyze the case where Y is small relative to X.
Proposition 1 If ki [ 0 and hi [ 0 for every i 2 N and G(X, Y) is a kind-game,
there exists a Y for which for all Y [ Y in the sequential group reciprocity
equilibria of G(X, Y) if the sign of the outcome for G2 ðYÞ is strictly positive then the
sign of the outcome for G1 ðXÞ is strictly positive and if the sign of the outcome for
G2 ðYÞ is strictly negative then the sign of the outcome for G1 ðXÞ is strictly negative.
All proofs are in the ‘‘Appendix’’.
When the material payoffs of single game 2 grow with respect to those of single
game 1, its fairness considerations dominate those of single game 1 if players care at
least to some degree about how their partners are treated. If the outcome of single
game 2 is strictly negative, the emotions of fairness of every player will be strictly
negative and no player would sacriﬁce their own material payoffs to be nice to their
opponent, which would eliminate any strictly positive outcome for game 1 also.
In Example 2, if Y is large enough with respect to X and if the outcome in single
game 2 is (defect, defect), which is a strictly negative outcome, then the fairness
considerations of single game 2 dominate those of single game 1, thus eliminating
any positive or neutral sequential group reciprocity equilibrium for the composite
game and any positive outcome for single game 1. As the material payoffs of single
game 2 grow arbitrarily large, the only outcome for single game 1 in the fairness
equilibrium is (defect, defect).
In Example 2, as Y becomes arbitrarily small, individuals in game 2 cooperate
only if individuals in game 1 also cooperate and defect if individuals in game 2
defect. As the material payoffs of a single game become arbitrarily small,
individuals care more about what is going on in their partner’s game and the fairness
kind and would be unkind if their partners are unkind.
Proposition 2 If ki [ 0 and hi [ 0 for every i 2 N and G(X, Y) is a kind-game,
there exists a Y for which for all Y 2 ð0; YÞ in the sequential group reciprocity
equilibria of G(X, Y) if the sign of the outcome for G1 ðXÞ is strictly positive then the
sign of the outcome for G2 ðYÞ is strictly positive and if the sign of the outcome for
G1 ðXÞ is strictly negative then the sign of the outcome for G2 ðYÞ is strictly negative.
Sequential group reciprocity equilibria may explain some outcomes that other
solution concepts cannot. For example, it is possible that a sequential group
reciprocity equilibrium exists where in each Prisoners’ Dilemma in Example 2 one
player plays ‘‘cooperate’’ while the other plays ‘‘defect’’.

Example 2 The payoffs in Example 2 are not symmetrical: in each game one of the
players has the opportunity to offset an unkind action carried out by their relative
with a much kinder action. If and ki [ 0 and hi [ 0 for every player, a sequential
group reciprocity equilibrium exists where in single game 1, the daughter of family
1 plays ‘‘defect’’ and the daughter of family 2 plays ‘‘cooperate,’’ and where the
mother of the family 1 plays ‘‘cooperate’’ and the mother of the family 2 plays
‘‘defect’’. Even if the daughter of family 1 treats the daughter of family 2 badly,
overall she would still think well of family 1 given that the mother of family 1 is
much kinder than her daughter is unkind. In Example 2, the outcome where the sum
of the material payoffs is maximized is one of the sequential group reciprocity
equilibria. We generalize the circumstances in which the outcome where the sum of
the material payoffs is maximized is a sequential group reciprocity equilibrium. The
basic assumption that make this outcome possible is that the payoffs are
asymmetric, which means that a player can greatly punish or reward another
player with little cost to herself, and players can be nice to each other if they choose
to be.
In Example 3, as the value of X increases, the payoffs become more asymmetric.

Game 2
Example 3 We should note that when X grows arbitrarily large to reach the
outcome that maximizes the sum of the material payoffs in a kind-game Q(X),
players 1 and 4 must maximize the material payoffs of their opponents, whereas
players 3 and 2 must maximize their own material payoffs and, when indifferent,
maximize those of their opponents.
Proposition 3 If Q(X) is a kind-game, ki [ 0 and hi [ 0, there exists an X where
for all X [ X the outcome that maximizes the sum of the payoffs is a sequential
group reciprocity equilibrium.
Proposition 3 shows that the outcome where the sum of material payoffs is
maximized is a sequential group reciprocity equilibrium as some individuals can
greatly help their opponents without incurring a high cost to themselves. By doing
so, they can offset the negative emotions set by those individuals that earn high
material payoffs by being selﬁsh.
3.2.1 Group reciprocity over two periods
Many interesting situations occur in group interactions when individuals anticipate
that the kindness or unkindness of their actions will have an effect on the behavior
of other individuals. For example, a person may be nice to somebody if she
anticipates that their relatives may respond by being nice to her or their relatives.
Similarly, terrorists may commit terrible acts to generate negative emotions among
the members of opposing ethnic groups to make them ﬁght each other. In this
where single game 1 is played ﬁrst and then single game 2 and both players in single
game 2 observe the outcome of single game 1 before they play. If players in single
game 1 know that their actions may affect the outcome of single game 2, they may
play differently to inﬂuence the actions of the players in single game 2.
Players in single game 1 maximize their utility in the knowledge that their actions
will affect the actions of players in single game 2. Given that they want their partners
to be treated kindly in game 2, they may be kind in the ﬁrst period in order to make
their partner’s opponent be kind in return, even if they are treated badly. Huck and
¨
Lunser (2010) show that in trust games individuals help their partners by sharing more
in order to create reputation for their group.2 Abbink and Herrmann (2009) create a
Vendetta game where members of two groups can reciprocate offences against their
own groups. They show that the threat of retaliation decreases the rate of conﬂict.
Proposition 4 shows that when the payoffs of the composite game are sufﬁciently
asymmetric, the sequential group reciprocity equilibria are outcomes where the sum
of the material payoffs are maximized.
Proposition 4 If Q(X) is a kind-game, ki [ 0 and hi [ 0 for every i 2 N, there
exists an X; where for all X [ X, the sequential group reciprocity equilibria in the
two-period game are outcomes that maximize the sum of the payoffs.
As X becomes large and the material payoffs become more asymmetric, the
emotions of kindness for all players are dominated by the actions of players 1 and 4
(those players that can be very kind or unkind with little cost to themselves). When
single game 1 is played ﬁrst, the actions of player 1 determine the outcome of single
game 2. If player 1 is kind in the ﬁrst period, player 4 will also be kind in the second
period (in contrast, if player 1 is unkind in the ﬁrst period, player 4 will be unkind in
the second period). Since the utility of player 1 is higher if the outcome is positive
rather than negative, she will choose to be kind.
Although Proposition 4 appears to contradict the news commonly shown in the
media, Fearon and Laitin (1996) show that interethnic cooperation is far more
common that interethnic conﬂict.
Proposition 4 applies to cases where individuals can help others with a low cost to
themselves and when other members of their group can repay the kindness the most by
being kind to their partners. There are many examples in which friends and relatives of
persons with power are often treated nicely in hope of being repaid by them. And there is
ample evidence that individuals help others in the moments they need it the most even
when they can not repay them in return. In international relations, countries help other
countries when there is a humanitarian disaster. Although this may be due to simple
altruism, it may also be due to a desire to create goodwill that will be returned later to
citizens or ﬁrms of the helping country. This is sometimes the case, as some countries give
more aid to poor countries with important natural resources to maintain good relations
(Lundsgaarde et al. (2010)).

Tirole (1996) analyze group reputation as the sum of the reputation of its members and how, because
individuals past behavior is observed only imperfectly, the reputation of a group is used to estimate the
actions to avoid retaliation against their relatives later. In situation of asymmetric
force, a police ofﬁcer may restraint from hurting a member of a minority, even if
provoked, not because he does not want to hurt him, but because he wants to avoid
the violence that this would provoke and may hurt other members from his own
group. For example Ron (2000) shows that the Israel army restrained their use of
force in the Palestinian Intifada, to avoid generating more violence.

4 Conclusions
In this paper, we introduced the emotions of fairness between groups to game theory
by extending Dufwenberg and Kirchsteiger’s model of sequential reciprocity to
groups of individuals. We assumed that individuals have emotions of fairness that
include not only the actions played against them, but also against other members of
their own group. We deﬁned a new solution concept, which we call ‘‘sequential
group reciprocity equilibrium’’ and analyzed how the outcomes of both games are
related.
This approach allows us to develop a theoretical model that explains the
experimental and empirical evidence that shows that individuals reciprocate not
only towards the individuals they are dealing with, but with other members of the
same group. We show that for very asymmetric games (those in which some players
can greatly punish or reward the opposite player with little cost to themselves), the
outcome where the sum of the payoffs is maximized is a SGRE, and if the games are
played sequentially, the outcome where the sum of the payoffs is maximized is the
only SGRE, as players in the ﬁrst period want their partners to be treated kindly in
period 2, they are kind in order to make their partner’s opponent be kind in return.
There are a number of possible extensions to this work. Firstly, in the real world,
the majority of interactions are repeated and, therefore, a repeated-game version of
group fairness would bring new and more realistic results. In international relations,
countries build their relations little by little, increasing their trust through kind
actions over time. It is reasonable to think that if an individual or group of
individuals are kind or unkind once and again, the feeling of kindness or unkindness
will grow larger with repeated interactions. It would be interesting to extend our
model by deﬁning a function of kindness that can increase or decrease over time
with the repetition of kind or unkind actions.
Secondly, in this paper, we have assumed the value of ki (the importance that a
player gives to other members of her group) to be ﬁxed. However, Akerlof and
Kranton (2000) show that individuals can, to a certain extent, choose their identity.
If individuals can choose how close they are to the groups to which they belong,
then they may choose their closeness to a group based on the actions and intentions
of the members toward each other and the actions and intentions of other individuals
toward the members of the group. For example, if the members of a family are
unkind to each other, we should not expect it to be as tightly knit as a family whose
members are kind to each other. Furthermore, it has been observed that the
groups would help to explain many phenomena, such as the increase in religious
fervor and nationalism after wars or interethnic conﬂicts.

Abstract Games that appear to be independent, involving none of the same players,
may be related by emotions of reciprocity between the members of the same groups.
In the real world, individuals are members of groups and want to reward or punish
those groups whose members have been kind or unkind to members of their own. In
this paper, we extend Dufwenberg and Kirchsteiger’s model of sequential
reciprocity (Games Econ Behav 47(2):268–298, 2004) to groups of individuals and
deﬁne a new ‘‘sequential group reciprocity equilibrium’’ for which we prove its
existence. We study the case of two games with two players in each game, where
each player belongs to the same group as a player in the other game. We show that
when the payoffs of one game are much higher than the payoffs of the other, the
outcome of the game with higher payoffs determines the outcome of the other game.
We also ﬁnd that when the payoffs are very asymmetric, the outcome where the sum
of the payoffs is maximized is a sequential group reciprocity equilibrium.

Usually, individuals want to pay kind acts with kindness and bad acts with
unkindness. This is known as fairness or reciprocity. Most models in economics
tend to ignore fairness or any other emotion despite its profound impact on
economic activity. For example, Rabin (1993) showed that consumers may not
consume a product (even if it is in their interest to do it) if they think its price is
unfair.1 Akerlof (1982) argues that workers repay high wages by giving a high effort
in their jobs. In the negative side, Krueger and Mas (2004) argue that after the
management of Firestone demanded concessions from the workers and hired
replacement workers during a strike, the workers responded by sabotaging the
products which resulted in 271 fatalities.
In his seminal paper, Rabin (1993) introduced fairness to game theory by
modeling how if one player believes that her opponent is sacriﬁcing her own
material payoffs to help her, then she may be willing to sacriﬁce her own material
payoffs as well to help her opponent in return; and if one player believes that her
opponent is treating her badly, she may sacriﬁce her own material payoff to treat her
opponent badly. As an example, Rabin shows how in the Prisoners’ Dilemma this
allows for a ‘‘fairness equilibrium’’ (FE from now on) in which both players play
‘‘cooperate’’ . Rabin’s model is deﬁned for two players in static games. Dufwenberg
and Kirchsteiger (2004) extended Rabin’s model to dynamic games for more
players with their solution concept of ‘‘sequential reciprocity equilibrium’’ (SRE
from now on).
However, these models assume that players do not care about the outcomes of
games in which they are not involved. In the real world individuals form emotions
of fairness based on the treatment of others and these emotions can affect the
outcome of their own games. For example, a mother may be nicer to someone who
is nice to her daughter. And in countless interethnic conﬂicts, individuals from each
of the groups involved have targeted innocent members of the other group to avenge
previous offenses. Less tragically, individuals sometimes buy products at a higher
price or of subpar quality solely because those products come from ﬁrms owned by
their fellow countrymen or by members of their own ethnic group.
The aim of this paper is to analyze the relationship between the outcome of
seemingly independent games (those games in which the players of one game are
different to the players of the others), stemming from the emotions of fairness and
reciprocity. For this, we extend Dufwenberg and Kirchsteiger (2004)’s model of
reciprocity, in which individuals want to reciprocate the kindness or unkindness of
other individuals, to a more comprehensive model that incorporates a sense of
fairness that depends on the payoffs of other members of our own groups.
Other economists have developed other models of reciprocity. Falk and
Fischbacher (2006), Levine (1998), Fehr and Schmidt (1999), and Bolton and
Ockenfels (2000) are some examples. However, we focus in Dufwenberg and
1

Kahneman et al. (1986) showed that individuals evaluate the fairness of an increase in the price of a
product as fair or unfair, depending on the motives of the increase. Individuals consider an increase in the
price of a product due to a higher demand as unfair and consider an increase in the price of a product due
intentions is essential to represent the idea of group reciprocity.
The contribution of this article is to extend the concept of reciprocity with the
following three stylized facts:
1.

2.

3.

Individuals want to increase the material payoffs of those individuals who
belong to the same groups as them and are willing to sacriﬁce their own
material payoffs in order to do it.
Individuals treat more kindly those individuals who have been kind to other
individuals who are close to them and individuals treat more unkindly those
individuals who have been kind to other individuals who are close to them.
The acts of kindness or unkindness of some members of a group can create
sympathy or resentment towards all the members of their group and a desire for
reciprocity towards each of these, even those who played no part in the original
acts.

We develop a game theoretic framework that incorporates these facts. In Sect. 2, we
present evidence that support the stylized facts of our model. We review both
empirical and experimental evidence.
In Sect. 3, we introduce our model by extending Dufwenberg and Kirchsteiger
(2004)’s model of sequential reciprocity to groups of individuals. We deﬁne a utility
function that represents all three stylized facts mentioned above and deﬁne a new
solution concept which we call ‘‘sequential group reciprocity equilibria’’.
In Sect. 3.1, we probe the existence of our solution concept in Theorem 1.
Although the proof is in ‘‘Appendix’’, we give a brief explanation of the proof. In
Sect. 3.1.1 we mention the differences between our model and the FE and SRE.
In Sect. 3.2, we develop an example to show the relation that the outcome of one
game has over the outcome of other games, due to emotions of group reciprocity. To
show the interaction between groups of individuals, we work with the easiest case:
two games of two players and two groups with two members. One of the members
of each group play in each game. We get the following basic results:
First, as the material payoffs of one game grow arbitrarily large, the outcome of that
game dominates the emotions of reciprocity of the players who play in the other game. In
the sequential group reciprocity equilibria, if the outcome of the game with arbitrarily
large payoffs is positive and both players are kind, the emotions of the players in the
other game are going to be positive and they will be kind also in their own game. In the
sequential group reciprocity equilibria, if the outcome of the game with arbitrarily large
payoffs is negative and both players are unkind, the emotions of the players in the other
game are going to be negative and they will be unkind also in their own game.
Second, in the sequential group reciprocity equilibria, when the material payoffs of
one game become arbitrarily small, the sign of outcome of that game is the same as
the sign of the outcome of the other game players in the game in which payoffs are
small are kind only if players in the other game are kind and unkind if players in the
other game are unkind. These two results are based on the same idea. If the stakes in
one game are much higher in one game in relation to the other, the outcome of that
individuals can greatly reward or punish their opposing players with little cost to
themselves), the outcome in which the sum of the material payoffs is maximized
is a sequential group reciprocity equilibrium. This result is very optimistic as it
concludes that in the outcome where the sum of the material payoffs is being
maximized, nobody wants to deviate (even if they can increase their own
material payoffs by doing it). The reason is that in this case, the emotional
payoffs is positive, in fact very positive, and even the players who can increase
their material payoffs by deviating, prefer to maximize their emotional payoffs
instead and being kind (as their partners are being treated nice, in fact, very
nice).
Fourth, in the case where one game is played ﬁrst and then the other, and the
material payoffs of the games are asymmetric enough, we ﬁnd that the
sequential group reciprocity equilibrium is that in which the outcome in which
the sum of the material payoffs of the players is maximized. The reason for this
is that the player in the ﬁrst period than can be very kind or unkind, wants to be
nice to her opposite in order for her own partner to be treated nicely in the
second period.
Finally, in Sect. 4, we conclude and discuss possible extensions.

2 Evidence
There is evidence that individuals often treat better other members of their own
groups. Tajfel et al. (1971) show that individuals favor members of their own group
when distributing rewards and penalties in situations in which irrelevant classiﬁcations distinguished between the in-group and the out-group. Ayres and Siegelman
(1995) show that black buyers of new cars are offered higher prices than white
buyers in dealerships in the Chicago area. Zussman (2013) ﬁnds that Arab buyers
and sellers in the Israeli online market for used cars are discriminated against. Price
and Wolfers (2010) ﬁnd that referees in the NBA award more personal fouls to
players of their opposite race. Chen and Li (2009) show that individuals are not only
more altruistic, but also they have less envy towards members of their own groups
and when matched with in-group members, are more likely to choose social welfare
maximization outcomes. Mitchell et al. (2005) shows that mock jurors tend to
decide in favor of individuals who share their ethnicity and were more likely to give
longer sentences for other race defendants.
Additionally, there is evidence that individuals evaluate the kindness of a
person, taking into consideration how that person has treated other individuals,
specially those who are close to them. Fehr and Fischbacher (2004), Engelmann
and Fischbacher (2008), Nowak and Sigmund (1998), and Nowak and Sigmund
(2005) show that individuals want to help/punish those individuals who are kind/
unkind towards other individuals. Goette et al. (2006) show that individuals who
platoon and when they were given the opportunity to punish defection of third
parties punished more harshly if the defection affected a member of their own
platoon.
Finally, there is evidence that the kindness or unkindness of individuals creates
sympathy or resentment towards all the members of their group and a desire for
reciprocity towards them, even those who played no part in the original acts. HughJones and Leroch (2010, 2011) show experimentally that individuals who were
harmed by an individual reacted by harming other member of that individual’s
group. Shayo and Zussman (2011) ﬁnd that judges in Israel treat more favorable
members of their own ethnic groups, and this bias increases after a terrorist attack in
the vicinity of the court. Edwards et al. (2007) show that consumers in New Zeland
and Australia reacted to the French Nuclear Test in the south paciﬁc in the mid1990s ﬁrms by reducing their consumption from French ﬁrms. Michaels and Zhi
(2010) ﬁnd that American ﬁrms’ willingness to pay for French inputs decreased
after France did not support American efforts to obtain UN Security Council
mandate to use military force against Iraq and American imports from France could
have being reduced for this reason for as much as 15%.

3 Model
Our model is deﬁned for dynamic games with perfect information. Ai is the set of
Q
strategies (possible mixed) for player i and A ¼ i2N Ai is the set of strategy
proﬁles for all players. ai 2 Ai is a strategy for individual i, bij 2 Ai are the beliefs of
individual i regarding the strategy of individual j and cijk 2 Ai are the beliefs of
individual i about the beliefs of the individual j about the strategy of player k
(second order beliefs). Strategy ai ðhÞ is the same as strategy ai , but playing history h
with probability one. pi : A ! R are individual i’s ‘‘material payoffs’’. H is the set
of the histories of the game and N is the set of the players in the game.
Let Si be a partition of N. Partition Si represents the different groups a player can
belong according to player i. By allowing for different partitions for different
players we are allowing for each player to have different beliefs of what the groups
are. For example, conceivable, it can happen that a player believes to belong to a
group, while others players do not believe it.
We ﬁrst deﬁne what an equitable payoff is and use it as a reference point to
evaluate the kindness of a strategy. We only look for the equitable payoffs in the set
of efﬁcient strategies. A payoff that is not efﬁcient cannot be equitable, given that
the player is giving a lower payoff to the opposing player without any beneﬁt to
herself. We deﬁne a player’s strategy as efﬁcient if there is no other strategy that
always gives every player a higher or equal payoff, with strict inequality for at least
one player. Because we require that at the equilibria all players maximize at every
Ei ¼

ai 2 Ai j there exists no a0i 2 Ai such that for all h 2 H; ðaj Þj6¼i 2

and m 2 N; we have that pm ða0i ðhÞ; ðaj ðhÞÞj6¼i Þ ! pm ðai ðhÞ; ðaj ðhÞÞj6¼i Þ;
)
with strict inequality for at least one ðh; ðaj Þj6¼i ; mÞ :
Ei is the set of strategies for player i that cannot improve any player at any history
without making another player worst off. As the FE and the SRE, we deﬁne the
equitable payoff as the average of the highest and the lowest of the payoffs in the set
of the efﬁcient strategies.
Deﬁnition 1 the ‘‘equitable payoff’’ for individual j at history h is given by the
following equation:

We use the equitable payoff as a reference point to evaluate the kindness of a
strategy. We propose that a strategy that provides an opponent a higher payoff than
the equitable payoff be evaluated as kind and a strategy that provides an opponent
with a lower payoff than the equitable payoff be evaluated as unkind. The following
function represents how kind an individual believes she is to her opponent.
Deﬁnition 2 the kindness of player i towards player j when playing strategy ai is
given by:




fij ai ðhÞ; ðbim ðhÞÞm6¼i ¼ pj ai ðhÞ; ðbim ðhÞÞm6¼i À pe ððbim ðhÞÞm6¼i Þ:
j

We refer to fij as the kindness function. We would evaluate the strategy of player
i as kind if the kindness function is positive, as the kindness function of player i is
positive only when she is sacriﬁcing her own material payoffs to increase the
material payoffs of player j. The more positive the kindness function is, the higher
the material payoff player i is giving to player j and the kinder we would evaluate
player i to be. We would evaluate the strategy of player i as unkind if the kindness
function is negative as the kindness function of player i is negative only when she is
sacriﬁcing her own material payoffs to decrease the material payoffs of player j. The
more negative the kindness function is, the lower the material payoff player i is
giving to player j and the unkinder we would evaluate player i to be.
Now, we deﬁne a function that represents how kind a player considers other
when she believes she is playing strategy bij is given by:


f
player at other histories. For example, in the Prisoners’ Dilemma, shown in Fig. 1
the utility of player 2 at history D, depends not only on the strategy of player 1, but
also on her own action at history C.
Dufwenberg and Kirchsteiger prove instead the existence of the SRE by
maximizing each player’s utility at every history in which they play, given not only
the strategies of the other players, but also their own actions at other histories. They
form a correspondence from the union of the best replies of every player at every
history and apply Kakutani’s ﬁxed point theorem to prove that this correspondence
has a ﬁxed point. This is an equilibrium as no player can improve at any particular
history by changing their actions on that history.
Theorem Every ﬁnite extensive game with perfect information has a Group
Fairness Equilibrium.
The proof of theorem 1 is in the ‘‘Appendix’’.
Our proof of existence follows Dufwenberg and Kirchsteiger (2004) proof of
existence of their concept of sequential reciprocity equilibrium by proving that there
is a sequential group reciprocity equilibrium where players maximize their utility at
every history simultaneously using Kakutani’s ﬁxed point theorem.

There are a few differences between our solution concept and the FE and the SRE.
1.

2.

3.

4.

The ﬁrst difference is that our solution concept includes the concept of SRE, but
extends it for reciprocity between the members of different groups. The ﬁrst
term inside the absolute value in our utility function is the equivalent to the
utility function used in the SRE. It is in the second term where our concept
differs from the SRE by including the emotion of reciprocity for the treatment
of other members of our own groups. If, for example, ki ¼ 0; our solution
concept is equivalent to the SRE.
The second difference is that our solution concept includes an absolute value
instead of the multiplication of the fairness functions, as the FE and the SRE do.
The reason for this is that we want to represent that players want to reciprocate
a kind or unkind act with the same intensity, unlike the FE and the SRE that
make the extreme assumption that players want to reciprocicate a small offense
with the highest possible punishment.
As the SRE, we do not normalize the reciprocity part of the utility function as
the FE does. We do this for simplicity, as our utility function is complicate as it
is now. This also allows us to prove the existence of our solution concept, as our
utility function is continuous. The utility function of the FE is discontinuous,
and therefore it cannot prove its existence.
Unlike the FE and the SRE, we include the material payoffs of the other
members of the group of each player in the utility function. This allows us to
represent that individuals not only want to reciprocate against kind or unkind
acts against members of their groups, but also they have the emotion of
altruism, especially with members of their own group.

3.2 Basic results
While most economists have assumed that players only care about what happens in
the games they play, our model assumes that players take into consideration also the
interaction of players in other games if they belong to their groups. Our aim is to
model how the outcome in one game may affect the outcome of other games.
In this section, we analyze the case of two games with two players in each game
and two groups with two members in each group. One of the members of each group
plays in each game. To be concise, we will refer to the other member of an
individual’s own group as her ‘‘partner’’ and the person an individual is playing
against as her ‘‘opponent’’.
We analyze the relationship that exists between the outcomes of two seemingly
independent games. As Rabin (1993), we study games where the material payoffs
may be arbitrarily small or arbitrarily large. For this, we consider a set of games that
are exactly the same, with the exception of the scale of their material payoffs. Let G
be the set of games that consists of the set of players N, where N ¼ f1; 2; 3; 4g; the
game that corresponds to the given values X and Y.
Given that the material payoffs for each player depend solely on his or her own
strategies and those of their opponents, we can think of each game G(X, Y) as a
game composed of two materially independent games, one made up of players 1 and
2 and the other made up of players 3 and 4. Let G1 be the set of games that consists
of players 1 and 2 and strategies A1 and A2 , and material payoffs X Á p1 ða1 ; a2 Þ and
X Á p2 ða2 ; a1 ÞÞ. Let G1 ð X Þ 2 G1 be the game that corresponds to a given value of X.
Let G2 be the set of games that consists of the set of players 3 and 4, the set of
strategies A3 and A4 , and the payoff functions Y Á p3 ða3 ; a4 Þ and Y Á p4 ða4 ; a3 Þ: Let
G2 ðY Þ 2 G2 be the game corresponding to a given value of Y.
Given that a game G(X, Y) is composed of games G1 ðXÞ and G2 ðYÞ, we
sometimes refer to G(X, Y) as ‘‘the composite game,’’ to G1 ðXÞ as ‘‘single game 1’’,
and to G2 ðYÞ as ‘‘single game 2’’. We refer to the set of players of single game 1 as
N1 and to the set of players of single game 2 as N2 :
Our intention is to identify the outcomes where all players are being kind or
unkind. To do so, we rewrite one of the Rabin’s deﬁnitions. Rabin (1993) works
with a single game; hence, his deﬁnitions are for a single game only. Rabin deﬁnes
the outcome of a game as a function of the sign of the kindness function of both
players. The outcome of a game is positive if both players are kind to each other and
negative if both players are unkind to each other.
Deﬁnition 6 For a single game m: (a) an outcome is strictly positive if for all
i; j 2 Nm ; j 6¼ i; we have fij [ 0; (b) an outcome is weakly positive if for all i; j 2
Nm ; j 6¼ i;we have fij ! 0; (c) an outcome is strictly negative if for all i; j 2 Nm ; j 6¼ i;
we have fij \0and (d) an outcome is weakly negative if for all i; j 2 Nm ; j 6¼ i; we
have fij 0:
For some results, we want to allow individuals to be nice to each other if they
choose to be. However, this is not possible in every game. For example, in the battle
of the sexes, an individual cannot be kind to his or her opponent, given that when a
person maximizes their opponent’s material payoffs, they are maximizing their own
material payoffs as well. We deﬁne a game where all individuals can be kind in
every possible situation as a kind-game.
Deﬁnition 7 A kind-game is a game where ph ðai Þ À pli ðai Þ [ 0for every ai 2 Ai
i
and for every i 2 N:
A kind-game is a game where all players always have the possibility of being
nice to their opponents, as in the Prisoners’ Dilemma. This deﬁnition excludes
games such as the battle of the sexes, where players do not make any sacriﬁce when
they maximize their opponent’s material payoffs.

Game 2 G2 ðYÞ
Example 1 In the next two propositions, we analyze the properties of the
sequential group reciprocity equilibria when the material payoffs of a single game
change while the material payoffs for the other single game remain the same. In
Proposition 1, we analyze the case where Y grows arbitrarily large while X remains
constant and in Proposition 2, we analyze the case where Y is small relative to X.
Proposition 1 If ki [ 0 and hi [ 0 for every i 2 N and G(X, Y) is a kind-game,
there exists a Y for which for all Y [ Y in the sequential group reciprocity
equilibria of G(X, Y) if the sign of the outcome for G2 ðYÞ is strictly positive then the
sign of the outcome for G1 ðXÞ is strictly positive and if the sign of the outcome for
G2 ðYÞ is strictly negative then the sign of the outcome for G1 ðXÞ is strictly negative.
All proofs are in the ‘‘Appendix’’.
When the material payoffs of single game 2 grow with respect to those of single
game 1, its fairness considerations dominate those of single game 1 if players care at
least to some degree about how their partners are treated. If the outcome of single
game 2 is strictly negative, the emotions of fairness of every player will be strictly
negative and no player would sacriﬁce their own material payoffs to be nice to their
opponent, which would eliminate any strictly positive outcome for game 1 also.
In Example 2, if Y is large enough with respect to X and if the outcome in single
game 2 is (defect, defect), which is a strictly negative outcome, then the fairness
considerations of single game 2 dominate those of single game 1, thus eliminating
any positive or neutral sequential group reciprocity equilibrium for the composite
game and any positive outcome for single game 1. As the material payoffs of single
game 2 grow arbitrarily large, the only outcome for single game 1 in the fairness
equilibrium is (defect, defect).
In Example 2, as Y becomes arbitrarily small, individuals in game 2 cooperate
only if individuals in game 1 also cooperate and defect if individuals in game 2
defect. As the material payoffs of a single game become arbitrarily small,
individuals care more about what is going on in their partner’s game and the fairness
kind and would be unkind if their partners are unkind.
Proposition 2 If ki [ 0 and hi [ 0 for every i 2 N and G(X, Y) is a kind-game,
there exists a Y for which for all Y 2 ð0; YÞ in the sequential group reciprocity
equilibria of G(X, Y) if the sign of the outcome for G1 ðXÞ is strictly positive then the
sign of the outcome for G2 ðYÞ is strictly positive and if the sign of the outcome for
G1 ðXÞ is strictly negative then the sign of the outcome for G2 ðYÞ is strictly negative.
Sequential group reciprocity equilibria may explain some outcomes that other
solution concepts cannot. For example, it is possible that a sequential group
reciprocity equilibrium exists where in each Prisoners’ Dilemma in Example 2 one
player plays ‘‘cooperate’’ while the other plays ‘‘defect’’.

Example 2 The payoffs in Example 2 are not symmetrical: in each game one of the
players has the opportunity to offset an unkind action carried out by their relative
with a much kinder action. If and ki [ 0 and hi [ 0 for every player, a sequential
group reciprocity equilibrium exists where in single game 1, the daughter of family
1 plays ‘‘defect’’ and the daughter of family 2 plays ‘‘cooperate,’’ and where the
mother of the family 1 plays ‘‘cooperate’’ and the mother of the family 2 plays
‘‘defect’’. Even if the daughter of family 1 treats the daughter of family 2 badly,
overall she would still think well of family 1 given that the mother of family 1 is
much kinder than her daughter is unkind. In Example 2, the outcome where the sum
of the material payoffs is maximized is one of the sequential group reciprocity
equilibria. We generalize the circumstances in which the outcome where the sum of
the material payoffs is maximized is a sequential group reciprocity equilibrium. The
basic assumption that make this outcome possible is that the payoffs are
asymmetric, which means that a player can greatly punish or reward another
player with little cost to herself, and players can be nice to each other if they choose
to be.
In Example 3, as the value of X increases, the payoffs become more asymmetric.

Example 3 We should note that when X grows arbitrarily large to reach the
outcome that maximizes the sum of the material payoffs in a kind-game Q(X),
players 1 and 4 must maximize the material payoffs of their opponents, whereas
players 3 and 2 must maximize their own material payoffs and, when indifferent,
maximize those of their opponents.
Proposition 3 If Q(X) is a kind-game, ki [ 0 and hi [ 0, there exists an X where
for all X [ X the outcome that maximizes the sum of the payoffs is a sequential
group reciprocity equilibrium.
Proposition 3 shows that the outcome where the sum of material payoffs is
maximized is a sequential group reciprocity equilibrium as some individuals can
greatly help their opponents without incurring a high cost to themselves. By doing
so, they can offset the negative emotions set by those individuals that earn high
material payoffs by being selﬁsh.
3.2.1 Group reciprocity over two periods
Many interesting situations occur in group interactions when individuals anticipate
that the kindness or unkindness of their actions will have an effect on the behavior
of other individuals. For example, a person may be nice to somebody if she
anticipates that their relatives may respond by being nice to her or their relatives.
Similarly, terrorists may commit terrible acts to generate negative emotions among
the members of opposing ethnic groups to make them ﬁght each other. In this
where single game 1 is played ﬁrst and then single game 2 and both players in single
game 2 observe the outcome of single game 1 before they play. If players in single
game 1 know that their actions may affect the outcome of single game 2, they may
play differently to inﬂuence the actions of the players in single game 2.
Players in single game 1 maximize their utility in the knowledge that their actions
will affect the actions of players in single game 2. Given that they want their partners
to be treated kindly in game 2, they may be kind in the ﬁrst period in order to make
their partner’s opponent be kind in return, even if they are treated badly. Huck and
¨
Lunser (2010) show that in trust games individuals help their partners by sharing more
in order to create reputation for their group.2 Abbink and Herrmann (2009) create a
Vendetta game where members of two groups can reciprocate offences against their
own groups. They show that the threat of retaliation decreases the rate of conﬂict.
Proposition 4 shows that when the payoffs of the composite game are sufﬁciently
asymmetric, the sequential group reciprocity equilibria are outcomes where the sum
of the material payoffs are maximized.
Proposition 4 If Q(X) is a kind-game, ki [ 0 and hi [ 0 for every i 2 N, there
exists an X; where for all X [ X, the sequential group reciprocity equilibria in the
two-period game are outcomes that maximize the sum of the payoffs.
As X becomes large and the material payoffs become more asymmetric, the
emotions of kindness for all players are dominated by the actions of players 1 and 4
(those players that can be very kind or unkind with little cost to themselves). When
single game 1 is played ﬁrst, the actions of player 1 determine the outcome of single
game 2. If player 1 is kind in the ﬁrst period, player 4 will also be kind in the second
period (in contrast, if player 1 is unkind in the ﬁrst period, player 4 will be unkind in
the second period). Since the utility of player 1 is higher if the outcome is positive
rather than negative, she will choose to be kind.
Although Proposition 4 appears to contradict the news commonly shown in the
media, Fearon and Laitin (1996) show that interethnic cooperation is far more
common that interethnic conﬂict.
Proposition 4 applies to cases where individuals can help others with a low cost to
themselves and when other members of their group can repay the kindness the most by
being kind to their partners. There are many examples in which friends and relatives of
persons with power are often treated nicely in hope of being repaid by them. And there is
ample evidence that individuals help others in the moments they need it the most even
when they can not repay them in return. In international relations, countries help other
countries when there is a humanitarian disaster. Although this may be due to simple
altruism, it may also be due to a desire to create goodwill that will be returned later to
citizens or ﬁrms of the helping country. This is sometimes the case, as some countries give
more aid to poor countries with important natural resources to maintain good relations
(Lundsgaarde et al. (2010)).
2

Tirole (1996) analyze group reputation as the sum of the reputation of its members and how, because
individuals past behavior is observed only imperfectly, the reputation of a group is used to estimate the
actions to avoid retaliation against their relatives later. In situation of asymmetric
force, a police ofﬁcer may restraint from hurting a member of a minority, even if
provoked, not because he does not want to hurt him, but because he wants to avoid
the violence that this would provoke and may hurt other members from his own
group. For example Ron (2000) shows that the Israel army restrained their use of
force in the Palestinian Intifada, to avoid generating more violence.

4 Conclusions
In this paper, we introduced the emotions of fairness between groups to game theory
by extending Dufwenberg and Kirchsteiger’s model of sequential reciprocity to
groups of individuals. We assumed that individuals have emotions of fairness that
include not only the actions played against them, but also against other members of
their own group. We deﬁned a new solution concept, which we call ‘‘sequential
group reciprocity equilibrium’’ and analyzed how the outcomes of both games are
related.
This approach allows us to develop a theoretical model that explains the
experimental and empirical evidence that shows that individuals reciprocate not
only towards the individuals they are dealing with, but with other members of the
same group. We show that for very asymmetric games (those in which some players
can greatly punish or reward the opposite player with little cost to themselves), the
outcome where the sum of the payoffs is maximized is a SGRE, and if the games are
played sequentially, the outcome where the sum of the payoffs is maximized is the
only SGRE, as players in the ﬁrst period want their partners to be treated kindly in
period 2, they are kind in order to make their partner’s opponent be kind in return.
There are a number of possible extensions to this work. Firstly, in the real world,
the majority of interactions are repeated and, therefore, a repeated-game version of
group fairness would bring new and more realistic results. In international relations,
countries build their relations little by little, increasing their trust through kind
actions over time. It is reasonable to think that if an individual or group of
individuals are kind or unkind once and again, the feeling of kindness or unkindness
will grow larger with repeated interactions. It would be interesting to extend our
model by deﬁning a function of kindness that can increase or decrease over time
with the repetition of kind or unkind actions.
Secondly, in this paper, we have assumed the value of ki (the importance that a
player gives to other members of her group) to be ﬁxed. However, Akerlof and
Kranton (2000) show that individuals can, to a certain extent, choose their identity.
If individuals can choose how close they are to the groups to which they belong,
then they may choose their closeness to a group based on the actions and intentions
of the members toward each other and the actions and intentions of other individuals
toward the members of the group. For example, if the members of a family are
unkind to each other, we should not expect it to be as tightly knit as a family whose
members are kind to each other. Furthermore, it has been observed that the
groups would help to explain many phenomena, such as the increase in religious
fervor and nationalism after wars or interethnic conﬂicts.

Note that Ui is a continuous function on a as pi ; fij ; eijk and the absolute value are

eijk are linear in a and the subtraction of the absolute value is a concave function and
f
therefore also quasi-concave.
Let Xi ðhÞ be the set of possible actions of player i at history h and let ai ðhÞ n x be

Let the best response for individual i at history h to be:

As Dufwenberg and Kirchsteiger we deﬁne the correspondence b as the union of

b ¼ i2N;h2H bi;h ðaÞ
Given that A is a nonempty, compact, convex space and Ui is continuous in a,
and quasi-concave in ai , b is a nonempty, convex-valued and upper hemicontinuous
correspondence.
Therefore, we can apply Kakutani’s ﬁxed point theorem. Hence there exists a
ﬁxed point in the best response. This ﬁxed point is a Fair Threat Equilibrium as no
player can improve by deviating from this strategy.
Proof of Proposition 1 If ki and hi are positive for every player, as Y becomes
arbitrarily large, the importance of the material payoffs of single game 2 increases and
the reciprocal payoffs of player 1 and 2 are dominated by the outcome of single game 2.
Because G(X, Y) is a kind-game, every player can be kind or unkind, but not neutral.
As the material payoffs of single game 2 become arbitrarily large and as they cannot
change the material payoffs of their partners (since they do not play in the same single
game), players 1 and 2 maximize their reciprocal payoffs and are going to be kind if
players 3 and 4 are kind and they are going to be unkind if players 3 and 4 are unkind.
Proof of Proposition 2 If ki and hi are positive for every player, as Y becomes
arbitrarily small, the importance of the material payoffs of single game 2 decreases
kind or unkind, but not neutral. As the material payoffs of single game 2 become
arbitrarily small and as they cannot change the material payoffs of their partners
(since the do not play in the same single game), players 3 and 4 maximize their
reciprocal payoffs and are going to be kind if players 1 and 2 are kind and they are
going to be unkind if players 1 and 2 are unkind.
Proof of Proposition 3 If ki and hi are positive for every player, we will show that
when X grows arbitrarily large, in the outcome that maximizes the sum of the
material payoffs all players play a best response to each other actions. h
Note that in the outcome that maximizes the sum of the material payoffs when
X grows arbitrarily large, players 2 and 3 maximize their own material payoffs, and
when indifferent, they maximize their opponents material payoffs, while players 1
and 4 maximize the material payoffs of their opponents. Also note that if X grows
arbitrarily large in game Q(X), the material payoffs of players 2 and 3 dominate
their reciprocal payoffs, while the reciprocal payoffs of players 1 and 4 dominate
their material payoffs (as no player can change the material payoffs of their partners
since they do not play in the same single game).
Also, if X grows arbitrarily large the payoffs of players 2 and 3 grow arbitrarily
large relatively to those of players 1 and 4 and therefore, if players 2 and 3 are
treated kindly (by players 1 and 4), not only them, but the other member of their
groups would have kind feelings and would want to be kind in return. Because in the
outcome that maximizes the sum of the payoffs players 1 and 4 maximize the
material payoffs of their opponents and Q(X) is a kind-game, both players are kind.
As X grows arbitrarily large, if players 1 and 4 are kind, they are maximizing
their utility by being kind to the players that were kind to their partners, while
players 2 and 3 maximize their utility by maximizing their own material payoffs.
Therefore, every player is playing their best response in the outcome that maximizes
the sum of the material payoffs.
Proof of Proposition 4 If ki and hi are positive for every player, when X becomes
arbitrarily large, the material payoffs of players 2 and 3 dominate their reciprocal
payoffs. However, the actions of player 4 in the second period depend on the actions
of player 1 in the ﬁrst period. As X becomes arbitrarily large the reciprocal payoffs
dominate the material payoffs of player 4. If player 1 kind, player 4 is kind and if
player 1 is unkind, player 4 is unkind.
h
In the ﬁrst period, as X becomes arbitrarily large the payoffs of player 3 dominate
the payoffs of player 1. Given that the payoffs for player 3 are higher when player 4
is kind than when is unkind, player 1 is going be kind, in order for player 4 to be
kind in response. This is a sequential group reciprocity equilibrium as all players are
maximizing their utility.
Because players 1 and 4 are maximizing their opponents material payoffs and
players 2 and 3 are maximizing their own material payoffs, the group fairness
equilibrium of the two-period game is the outcome where the sum of the material
