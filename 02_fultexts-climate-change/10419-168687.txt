In the current economic context, marked by globalization, by the increasingly wide
recognition of the interdependence between environment and development, increasingly
widely shared is the view that the social responsibility of companies and the approach to
sustainable development should become integral parts of economic concepts used by
businesses in order to ensure the maintenance of balance between economic growth, stocks
of natural resources and social progress.
Thus, it is estimated that companies should pursue systematic implementation of economic
projects, social and environmental objectives derived from economic projects by: ensuring
long-term economic performance, meeting the needs and expectations of stakeholders,
ensuring that the principles of sustainable development are respected (Olaru, M., et al.,
2009a, Suditu C. et al., 2009). Achieving these objectives would result in creating value for
each of the stakeholders: customers, shareholders, business partners, company staff, and for
society at large.
In line with these concerns, the European Union strategy for sustainable development has
been adapted to permanently growing requirements of the society, demands embodied in
the regulations becoming more stringent. In this respect an important step was the adoption
of EU directives and the "New Approach" on technical harmonization and standardization,
which attaches great importance to the essential requirements for the protection of life,
health and environmental protection.
The new EU strategy on Sustainable Development, adopted in 2009, is geared towards
achieving long-term objectives of implementing environmental actions, the actions to
counter the phenomenon of global poverty and start preparation for social inclusion
(European Commission, 2009, p. 16).
Accordingly, in the case of SMEs, with a determinant role in the economic growth, an
imminent the question is that of satisfying the requirements of society by these enterprises
in terms of an integrated approach to sustainable development values (Olaru et al., 2009).
Note that in services, these companies are dominant. Thus, in Romania 86% of existing
SMEs operate in various services sectors (trade, construction, hotels and restaurants,
transport and telecommunications, financial intermediation, real estate, health and social
services, etc.) (Eurobarometer Team of the European Commission, 2008).
1. Considerations for commercial activity and social responsibility
In the business environment there are various opinions about the significance of sustainable
development (Laine, M., 2005), based on three aspects, which form the basis of this
concept: economic growth, ecological balance and social progress (Stigson, B., 2000), of
which we mention the following:
•

There is a certain tendency to promote the business interpretation of sustainable
development, similar to the interpretation that the company can provide solutions
to environmental problems. At this level we identify similarities to the weak nature
of sustainable development.

•

In terms of managers, the term refers primarily to the eco-efficiency (Bebbington,
J., and Thomson, I., 1996; Springett, D., 2003 Laine, M., 2005, p. 399). Ecoefficiency means of synergy between environmental performances and economic
performances create value for organization and community, resulting in a smaller
negative impact (Stigson, B., 2000).

•

Another approach is that the sustainable development can be achieved by creating
open and competitive markets, properly contoured internationally (World Business
Council for Sustainable Development, 2002 Laine, M., 2005, p. 399).

•

The approach of this concept by the organization is made in terms of a
commitment which can be made and respected (Springett, D., 2003 Laine, M.,
2005, p. 399).

In close connection with the principles of sustainable development a particular importance
is given to corporate social responsibility, internationally defined as specific models of
management systems, implemented by a growing number of organizations. A number of
companies prefer to integrate social responsibility management system with quality
management systems, environmental ones and those relating to occupational health and
safety, developed according to the international standards ISO 9001, ISO 14001 and
OHSAS 18001 (Suditu, C. et al., 2009).
In these circumstances, it is believed that social responsibility of the company is important
in ensuring long-term commercial advantage, making it easier to obtain the trust of
customers and other stakeholders.
The term "responsible business" refers to ensuring the economic success of an organization
by integrating social and environmental issues in its processes so the organization can
adequately manage the impact of environmental processes and can help solve community
problems on the whole. In other words, such work involves meeting customers'
requirements but also satisfy the expectations of other stakeholders - staff organization,
business partners, and the community as a whole.
Concerns about ensuring responsible business activities have become more serious,
especially in a globalized economy and increasingly broad recognition of the
interdependence between nature and society, which resulted in new requirements from
customers, local communities, regulatory authorities, banks, financiers and insurance
providers. In the new conditions, more and more organizations are interested to improve the
operation, so that it can contribute to the general good of the community.
2. Specific values for sustainable development in terms of EFQM Excellence Model
Generally speaking, values that promote and support sustainable development are: freedom,
equality, solidarity, tolerance, respect for nature and taking on the responsibility of
managing economic and social development globally (Shepherd, D., A. et al., 2009).
In the business environment attention is paid to the manner in which the concept of
sustainable development can be integrated into a model of excellence in business. The
binder of the two issues, sustainable development and excellence in business is the
customers’ needs by calling on existing natural resources without impeding or damaging
the ability of the next generation to meet their own needs.
Regarding the sustainable development from a process perspective, the values on which it
is based are (Garvare, R. and Isaksson, R., 2001):
•

Creating and maintaining a sustainable balance between the various stakeholders;

•

Assimilate the concept of excellence through continuous learning and adaptation
ability to change. Acquiring such values results in: individualization of products
according to customers’ needs and developing products, which consume fewer
resources;

•

Achieve a level of excellence based on performance proceedings. This means
managing processes effectively and efficiently, achieving a result that maximizes
the integrated value supported by an interested party in the long term, maintaining,
however, a balance between the demands and expectations of other stakeholders.
Excellence based on process performance creates the premises for improving and
learning coordination in system components;

•

Treatment of stakeholders starting from democratic principles as integrity and
respect, accountability and leadership approach is, to some extent, everybody’s
attribute;

•

Transparency, so that through open communication, and information of all
interested stakeholders on performance standards they will be able to reach a fair,
competitive and predictable environment.

In the economic environment, one of the excellence models implemented by businesses is
the excellence model of the European Foundation for Quality Management, model of
evaluation criteria which have affinities with values specific to the concept of social
responsibility and that of sustainable development.
EFQM excellence model in recent years has become a particularly effective tool for
developing management and human performance of an organization representing the most
successful European model for quality in business.
This model offers not only the benefits of a strategy verified in the practice of quality
management relevant for the European economic context, but also the orientation towards
customer’s satisfaction and other stakeholders-staff organization and society as a whole.
Also, its flexibility allows the model to be applied with the same success by large
organizations as well as by small and medium enterprises.
The model helps businesses to assess their performance, to understand where problems
exist, further encouraging them to find solutions to eliminate their causes.
Through the nine basic criteria of the model and the corresponding sub-criteria, we aim at
assessing all the aspects that contribute to obtaining performance and establishing a score
that reflects, as closely as possible, the importance of each category of work organization
and ultimately the organization's overall performance (Figure no. 1).
These criteria are divided into two categories "Enablers" and "Results".

The “Enables” are (Olaru, M. et al., 2008a, EFQM, 2009): leadership, policies and
strategies by which the organization implements its vision and mission, people whose
knowledge and skills are provided by training and continuous improvement, developed
partnerships and resources involved to achieve objectives and processes which are key
components in implementing organizational policies and strategies and which create added
value.
Regarding the “Results”, which are assessed in terms of the criteria for society results,
along with those on the customer results, people results and key performance results.
The evaluation of the performance of each criterion shall be based on a rating scale with
five levels (0%, 25%, 50%, 75% and 100%), according to the EFQM methodology
established by EFQM, by awarding points. The maximum score, appropriate to the
performance of 100% of all criteria, is 1,000 points. The final score quantifies the results
for the entire organization and all its activities and represents the overall efficiency of the
organization.
The evaluation criteria, which have affinity values specific to social responsibility and
sustainable development, in the EFQM excellence model is "society results" (Figure no. 1).

The model suggests therefore that meeting the requirement of customers and of the staff,
the responsible approach of the requirements of society, can be provided through
appropriate management, to mobilize resources for this purpose, primarily the human ones,
all business processes according to defined policies and strategies, with the integration of
organizational excellence principles. Meeting the mentioned requests, acquiring a
organization.
3. Methodology of Research
For achieving our objectives, the research was conducted as a questionnaire-based study on
SMEs in Romania between 2007 -2008.
To determine the minimum sample size the researchers used the following formula
(Balaure, 2002):
n =

t

2

⋅ p. (1 - p ) ,
Δ2ω

(1)

where
n = minimum sample size,
t = coefficient corresponding to the probability with which the results are guaranteed (from
the statistical tables of the Student distribution),
p = proportion of sample components that have explored feature (when "p" is unknown, it
is considered equal to 0.5 - corresponding maximum dispersion);
Δω – acceptable error limit.
To determine the minimum sample, the coefficients of the above formula have the
following values:
t = 2 (corresponding to a probability of 0.95)
p = 0.5 (corresponding to maximum value of dispersion)
Δω = 0.07 (error limits)
By entering values quantities t, p and Δω in the formula resulted the value of 205
companies for the minimum sample size (2):
n=

2 2 x 0,5x (1 - 0,5 )
0,07 2

= 205 companies

(2)

To achieve the research were sent 3100 questionnaires and have been received 1227
completed questionnaires, of which 830 in services (698 SMEs and 132 large enterprises).
Of these, 231 SMEs and 32 large companies are in trade.
The questionnaire was structured in the following sections:
•

General information about the organization (name, field of activity, employment,
etc.)

•

The effects of implementation and certification of quality management systems;

•

evaluating whether the criteria of the European model of quality management are
met;

•

methods used by the organization to assess and improve performance.

For the evaluation of answers the researchers used a five-level scale of assessment, from
"no" to " very much "/" all "(if applicable), and some of the questions answered were with
two variants, namely affirmative or negative.
This paper presents the results of research conducted in the sample of 231 SMEs in the field
of trade in Romania, to assess whether this category of companies promote sustainable
development in terms of specific values of the European model of EFQM excellence.
4. The research results
Among the requirements formulated by the EFQM excellence model in the criterion 'results
on the company ‘ there are: reducing pollution, reducing risks to human health and safety,
reducing waste, concerns for recycling, the active involvement of the organization in
community life, etc.
In the study conducted according to the methodology presented, it was intended to
determine to what extent SMEs in trade from Romania monitor and evaluate the impact of
processes on the community, based on performance indicators in order to ensure
compliance with the criteria of "society results" from the EFQM excellence model and
appropriate sub-criteria.
For this purpose the questionnaire used included the following question, with appropriate
response options: your organization ensures compliance with company requirements,
through (various variants can be given):
a) monitoring and assessing the environmental impact of processes,
b)

reducing and preventing environmental impact processes,

c)

reducing and preventing risks to health and safety at work;

d) assessing community perception of central and local authorities, regulatory bodies
on the social impact of the organization,
e)

active involvement in community life,

f)

use of performance indicators relating to social impact of the organization.

g)

other (please indicate).

4.1 Monitoring and assessing the impact of processes on environment
By processing the data obtained from the study resulted that only 43% of trade SMEs
monitor "greatly" or "very much" the impact of processes on environment. An important
percentage, namely 35% of SMEs in the trade said they hadn’t monitored at all or monitor
to a little extent the impact of processes on environment. (Figure no. 2).
We consider we should rethink the role which a small trade is to take on, and linking these
businesses with the demands of society in order to timely identify expectations, ensuring a
proper management of resources and reducing the negative impact of activities on the
environment.

Data obtained in the process of assessment and monitoring the environmental impact of
processes are used "largely" or "very much" to reduce and prevent these impacts by 46% of
SMEs surveyed trade (Figure no. 3).

5 - very much
Although in recent years, we remark an improvement of the level of using data resulting
from evaluation and monitoring processes impact on the environment, the share of SMEs in
trade that do not use " at all" the data or use them " to a small extent" to reduce and prevent
this impact is still large (35% of all SMEs surveyed).
Therefore, in the case of SMEs in trade, we can state that there is a reduced capacity to
respond to signals received from the company regarding the demands of society for the
protection of life, health and environmental protection (Stoleriu, Gh. and Olaru, M., 2003,
Olaru, M. and Stoleriu, Gh., 2007). We believe that the financial difficulties faced by SMEs
in Romania, including those on trade, have a negative impact in this regard.
4.3 Reducing and preventing risks to health and safety at work

Share of enterprises (%)

According to the study, 52% of SMEs in trade are preoccupied "largely" or "very much" by
reducing and preventing risks to health and safety at work. The share of SMEs without such
concerns, or whose concerns are to " a small extent" to reduce and prevent risks to health
and safety at work is about 16% and 20% of SMEs surveyed said that they deal in a
satisfactory manner with these issues (Figure no. 4). It follows that in this respect, there are
significant reserves to improve the SMEs in Romanian trade.

4.4 Establishment and implementation of a program of continuous improvement
of the requirements for the protection of life, health and environmental
protection
a) Assessment of perception of the community, local and central authorities, regulatory
bodies on the social impact of the organization
Following the research conducted it appears that SMEs in trade are less concerned with
improving the perception of the community, of the central and local authorities, of the
regulatory bodies regarding the impact of the organization's activities on society (Figure no.
5). Thus, 38% of SMEs surveyed said they were not dealing "at all" or only "to a little

extent" and 40% of them consider that they work "to a great extent" or "very much" to
assess these perceptions.

b) The involvement of organization in community life

Share of enterprises (%)

According to the study, SMEs in trade got involved slightly in the community life. Thus,
only 35% of SMEs surveyed said they got involved "highly" or "very much" in the
community life, the share of those not involved at all or involved "to a small extent" being
38% (Figure no. 6).

Thus, only 32% of them said they systematically use such indicators, the vast majority of
SMEs surveyed, that is 68% do not use at all or use the "very little" or in a "satisfactory"
manner such indicators (Figure no. 7).
d) The fulfillment degree of criterion “society results” of the European excellence model by
SMEs in trade

results “(Figure no. 8) .In comparison, only 17% of them consider that they fully meet this
criterion, using performance indicators for monitoring and evaluation the impact of
processes on the community.

Figure no. 8: Degree of fulfillment criterion of “society results“ of the EFQM
Excellence Model by SMEs in Romanian trade
responsibility of SMEs surveyed. This could be due to the fact that the concerns of SMEs,
particularly those of trade, regarding the implementation of an environmental management
system or a quality management system - environment – occupational health and safety are
still in the early stages.
Correlating the results concerning the degree of fulfillment of that criterion of the EFQM
model of excellence to those obtained on the effects of implementation and certification of
management systems (Olaru, M. et al., 2008b, Olaru, M. and Stoleriu, Gh., 2006), we can
state that the results are better for the SMEs that have a quality management system or an
integrated management system implemented according to the models proposed by
international standards ISO 9000, ISO 14000 and OHSAS 18001.
This can be explained by the fact that SMEs in trade, which have implemented such
management systems, following the specific requirements for these systems, have
developed a program to continuously improve processes, systematically using performance
indicators to measure the impact of these processes on the community (Suditu, C. et al.,
2009).
5. Improve the activity of SMEs in trade from the perspective of the specific values of
sustainable development promoted by the EFQM Excellence Model
For improving the activity of SMEs in trade, in terms of specific values of sustainable
development promoted by the European model of the EFQM excellence, are necessary
changes in mentality and in the action manner of management and all staff, to increase
social responsibility of every employee (Olaru, M. et al., 2008a, Stoleriu, Gh. et al., 2009).
In this sense, we consider that firstly, SMEs in trade should give greater importance to
proper resolution of complaints received from the community as a whole, taking into
account the minimal requirements defined by international standards ISO 9000.
Thus, it should be established, firstly, a uniform procedure for resolving such complaints
(Olaru, M. and Stoleriu, Gh., 2007). In setting policy and targets, on the complaint handling
process, should be taken into account legal requirements and the data from all stakeholders.
We also believe that the recommendations made by international standard ISO 10002 on
the stages of solving customer complaints should be also considered in the case of claims
received from the community regarding the protection of life, health and environment.
Thus, this process could include the following steps:
•

dissemination of material which shows availability for the enterprise to solve
complaints from the community,

•

collecting and recording such complaints;

•

confirm receipt of complaints;

•

assessing claims for their validity;

•

operative resolution of complaints;

•

information on community action;

regular analysis of complaints received to determine trends and to remove the
causes that lead to complaints.

Also, to ensure the efficiency of resolving the complaints process, the enterprise should
(Olaru, M. and Stoleriu, Gh., 2007, Olaru, M. and Stoleriu, Gh., 2009 ):
•

apply the best practices for solving complaints from the community;

•

encourage an approach to society in the organization;

•

encourage innovation in the process of solving complaints;

•

provide exemplary solving of complaints.

The data resulting from the resolution of complaints should be used to improve processes
and services so as the requirements of society for the protection of life, health and
environmental protection to be better satisfied.
On the other hand, under increasing societal demands for protection of life, health and
environment, economic practice is increasingly recognized to meet these demands and the
competitive pressure, the management of companies should ensure continuous
improvement of environmental performance and sanogenetic processes and outcomes of
these processes (Olaru, M. and Stoleriu, Gh., 2008, Popescu S. et al., 1999).
The data resulting from the evaluation and monitoring for meeting the needs of society for
the protection of life, health and environmental protection should be used primarily for
projects that improve existing processes or to implement new processes (Olaru, M. et al.,
2008c, Olaru, M. and Stoleriu, Gh., 2009).
Conclusions
Under the pressure of increasingly restrictive regulations and given the growing importance
of sanogenetic and environmental criteria in separating marketing products and services, in
a highly dynamic and diversified offer, more and more organizations are concerned to
improve the results in relation to society as a whole, with particular focus on promoting
sustainable development principles.
Following the research-based questionnaire resulted that for SMEs in Romania on trade,
whose interests on implementing a quality management system is in its early stages, the
satisfaction degree of the society requirements from the perspective of an integrated
approach to sustainable development values in the EFQM Excellence Model, is relatively
low.
Given the results of research conducted, it can be concluded that the enlargement of the
process of implementing a quality management system complying with ISO 9000 can
provide the necessary preconditions for improving the response capacity of SMEs in trade
to the company's growing demands to promote principles of sustainable development in
light of the EFQM Excellence Model.
In the long run, such an approach should be integrated in the process of promoting and
developing an organizational culture oriented towards business excellence based on process
health and environment, which allows integration of sustainable development values. It is
also necessary to improve communication of SMEs in trade with all stakeholders and to
develop systems for collecting and processing relevant information about the external
environment and community expectations.
Results of research can be a starting point for improving SMEs in Romanian trade to meet
the demands of society, from the perspective of an integrated approach to sustainable
development values, with positive impact on improving the overall performance of these
enterprises.
