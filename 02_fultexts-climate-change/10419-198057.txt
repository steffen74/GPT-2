1. OVERVIEW

Economic interdependences became more frequent in the postwar period, manifesting in a
variety of forms that stimulate the adhesion process. In the second report of the Club of Rome,
coordinated by the laureate of the Nobel prize for economy, Jan Tinbergen, a series of
interdependences are highlighted and it is argued that they are generated by: the need for food,

considerable differences between the rich and the poor countries. From a generic perspective,
globalization expresses the process of expansion of social, economic and political activities across
the borders (national, then regional) in such a way that events that occur or decisions that are made
in a certain area of the world come to have an impact and influence the lives of people in the other
corner of the world. In light of the diversity of views and the absence of agreement on a single
definition of globalization, we define it here in a narrow sense to mean the process through which
the world‟s national economies, markets, and businesses are witnessing increasing connectivity. To
yet others globalization is seen as a process through which an international, multicultural,
borderless, and even information society is being constructed (Nshimbi Christopher Changwe,
2006, p.2)
The globalization, seen as a distinct, unique and unrepeatable process, appeared after the
second world war, when:
 were created the conditions for the polarization of the world in two major sides;
 appeared a new political world order through the creation of the Organization of the
United Nations, which was supposed, via its institutions and agencies, to provide the legal
and institutional frame for the preservation of peace and world security, the development
of amicable relations between nations and the realization of international cooperation for
the purposes of solving international problems with an economic, social, intellectual or
humanitarian aspect;
 the process of decolonization led to the formation of new states in the regions of SubSaharan Africa, Northern Africa and Middle East, South-East Asia and the Pacific.
From our perspective, the end of the Cold War also meant the end of the first stage of
contemporary globalization. Firstly, there is no political globalization of the world, based on some
universally accepted democratic principles. In this period, the existence of totalitarian states was
periodically threatened from the inside, as well as from the outside, the last decade of the Cold War
being the ultimate witness of the successful attempts of abolishing dictatorial regimes. We must not
forget the fact that there are still states under uni-personal, totalitarian regimes (Cuba, North Korea,
the countries dominated by Islamic fundamentalism). Secondly, in the postwar period, we would
rather talk (as far as we are concerned, as a continent) of sub-regional or zonal organizations
(Council for Mutual Economic Assistance and European Economic Community) that were not the
unique voice of the region – Europe, due to its totally opposite ideological principles regarding its
formation. Post Cold War globalization registered a considerable level of institutionalization,
replacing the rigid and bipolar division of the world with the multi-polarity that expressed itself as

but rather complementary processes. Globalization implies action in very vast, but concretely
delineated spaces, enabling common decisions at a regional level. Thirdly, the military globalization
registered in that period represented a limited evolution of the system of alliances and a rather
predictable structure of international security. The Cold War divided the world under several of its
aspects (economic, social and cultural life), but it also reunited it under the form of global military
order, called “the equilibrium of terror”.
Regionalisation, especially in its de jure forms involving greater or lesser degrees of formal
policy integration among governments, emerges as a political response to the challenges of
globalisation and at the same time helps to strengthen the microeconomic forces that drive
globalisation by stimulating internal competition; significantly enlarging regional markets open to
participants; weakening the power of special-interest groups which resist greater competition or
attempt to turn regional agreements into bastions of protection; and reestablishing collectively,
among participants, policy sovereignty vis-à-vis internal and global markets (Oman Charles, 1994,
p.4).
Regionalization is the realization of some regional trade arrangements with various degrees
of adhesion. Two values of regional integration can be identified for the postwar period: beginning
with the 50s, there were numerous attempts to create some free trade areas or common markets in
Europe, Africa, Latin America, the Caribbean Islands and Asia. Except for Europe, the attempts of
regional integration of the first wave failed. The regionalism of the second wave is a phenomenon
of the 90s. It is vaster than the first wave and it may have been provoked by the increasing
international interdependence and the progress in the field of communications. The second wave
consists in the attempts to create regional trade agreements, customs associations, customs unions
and common markets.

2. GLOBALIZATION AND THE REGIONAL SUCCESS

Although regionalization (the division in regions) is widely spread in the territorial
organization of European countries, it is impossible to define a common fundamental concept for all
existing regions. In some countries like, for example, Italy, the regions immediately became
functional, in other countries they serve as a means of actions of economic nature for the central
government. This was the case of France and Great Britain. The reforms of the reform attempts (in
Belgium, Spain, France and Portugal) in the period of the 70s transformed regionalization in the
main topic of political debates. Many states do not recognize the region as a new level of the

various elaborated concepts about the region. The regionalization of the new member states and of
the states that will adhere in the future contributed to the diversification of the term region. This is
why there is a tendency to hesitate between two fundamentally opposed and equally inappropriate
concepts. The first concept is based on a purely descriptive definition: the region is the entity
situated immediately under the level of central government, with a political power of representation,
via the selected board. The second concept is based on the representation of the region via an
association or institution created at a regional level by the immediately inferior authorities (as is
defined in the statute of the Reunion of European Regions).
The newest initiative in the regional politic domain is represented by the Communication of
the Commission from July 2003, reffering to the creation of a new instrument of promoting of the
sustainable economic and social development. It is about the ,,Neighbourhood Instrument”, which
appears as a consequence of the extending process of EU and reflects the interest for the Union
border change. This new instrument is based on the existing experience in promoting the crossborder cooperation, acumulated by Phare, Tacis and Interreg programs, and will be centred on the
assurance of the well functioning and a good management of the future borders in East, with the
purpose of development of the border regions.
This instrument can also contribute to the promovation of stability and prosperity inside and
outside the Union borders.
The objectives considered by this instrument are:
Promoting of economic and social development in the border regions;
The cooperation for treating the common needs, in fields like: environment
protection, public health, fighting against the organised crime;
The assurance of safe and efficient borders;
The promoting of local actions - „man to man”.
The factors that are taken into consideration for the strengthening of a system of functional
regions, of potential success, and those for the development of regions are: historical factors, related
to tradition; cultural factors; the geographical factor (natural homogeneousness and the connection
with the state borders); the adequate dimension for real and efficient socio-economic activities; a
number of center of development/potential growth (city which are likely to develop with a bidirectional socio-economic dynamics in relation to the marginal area). Also, there are the market
factors, cost factors, governamental factors and competitiveness factors.

Research performed by well-known experts (for example, Dunford and Hudson) show that
the government decentralization in regions is not enough to guarantee economic success. They
discovered that the prosperous EU regions:
display a high level of social cohesion and participation ;
achieve relations of cooperation in the field of industry, which are illustrative of their
flexibility and security
have cooperation at the level of the companies, including a network of cooperation
“incorporate” internal investments, which have a considerable added value in the
regional economy

have government institutions, which have “learned to learn”
maximize the potential of trans-border synergies
manifest a vibrant, state accepted civil society

3. THE CONSEQUENCES OF REGIONALIZATION & GLOBALIZATION AT
EUROPEAN LEVEL

In many of the European regions with economic success, social cohesion and participation
appear as imperative conditions for economic success. The symbiotic relationship between cohesion
and success manifests itself in multiple ways, and many of them can be resumed as culture of
commitment, which gravitates around a variety of relations based on cooperation and trust. It is also
true that in some successful regions of Western Europe, the character of social inclusion is
obviously problematic – for example, many workers in the successful regions in Germany are
international migrants, with no citizen rights. This suggests the fact that economic success can be, in
some circumstances, dependent on the partial and selective opinions concerning cohesion. Many of

companies, which highlight cooperation, trust and network communication. Often, these networks
have the specific character of the place, as is the case of the industrial areas of interconnected small
and medium enterprises. Many small enterprises are dynamic and rely on innovative design, order
based production and quality, in order to be able to remain competitive. Network connection, based
on mutual trust, enables these companies to successfully adopt competitive strategies. Cooperation
networks facilitate training, innovation, the spreading of knowledge and the creation of specific
territorial types of knowledge, essential for competitiveness. There are ,however, significant
differences between these regions,

where “the horizontal” networks of SMEs are the main

advantage of the corporate picture (as is the case with the North-East and center of Italy) and those
dominated by major companies ( such as Baden-Württemberg). The relations of cooperation
between companies are centered on formal agreements, often complementary to the realization of
some performance objectives and less to a non-formal relation of trust. Nevertheless, the network
collaboration relations of large companies are at least partially transnational. Thus, this means that
“old” industries that exist in poor economic regions of Europe can become a basis for future
growth, if the appropriate organizational structures evolve. The globalization process and the
marketing approach of investments launched a new modality of “investments in companies that are
representative for a particular branch” in the marginal regions of the European Union, thus enabling
an economic activity with a greater added value and a tighter connection with economy and the
regional capacity. These schemes introduce, via the constitution of a “supply network”, a better
diversification of market risks (by abandoning market segments). Such a “quality” of attracted
investments can create an important number of new workplaces, and may have many other positive
effects on regional economy, even if it is necessary to emphasize the fact that investments in
companies belonging to this branch in the marginal regions of Europe will lead to the utilization of
the unqualified workforce for mass production. No one can deny the fact that the success of a
region depends on the government system and on the pro-active approach of local governments in
the socio-economic field, authorizing and facilitating the appearance of institutions, forming
partnerships with the civil society and the business community. These mechanisms enable the
elimination of borders and support the formation and the development of local/regional economies.
The governmental structures of the state should be ware of the fact that national economy is rooted
in regional/local economy and the regional/local models of development are, usually, incorporated
in successful national economies.


DIFFERENCE

BETWEEN

GLOBALIZATION

AND

REGIONALIZATION

It consists in the fact that, in the case of regionalization, liberalization occurs on a smaller
scale, geographically limited to the space of the states that participate in the grouping. Economic
data highlight the fact that the volume of inter-regional trade increases as fast as that of intranational trade, which proves that regionalization is an integral part of globalization. Poorly
developed countries advocate the idea of regional integration, arguing that its practical realization
represent the way towards industrialization, the liquidation of economic regress and the expansion
of the connections between the countries in the integrated areas. In this respect, one of the deputies
of the general manager of the International Monetary Fund, Alassane D. Quattara, states that
regional integration constitutes an important step towards global integration: “developing countries
cannot escape globalization and should not try to avoid it”. Trade played a significant part in the
globalization process, since the expansion of manufacturing in industrialized countries was due to
the accentuated interpenetration of national economies, to a large extent by means of intra-branch
trade, in such a way that global markets evolved in relation to processed products, as well as in
relation to their inputs. The increase of trade between developed and developing countries, in the
80s, also reflected a change in the nature of production. Thus, a new international labor division
was formed. Markets tend to become global due to the fact that internal markets are no longer
capable to bear the increasing costs of research and development and the shorter and shorter
lifecycles of the products, from a technological perspective. In an increasingly accentuated
modality, large corporations are expanding their scope outside their national borders, resorting to
transnational management in the field of innovation, manufacturing and trade. A genuine network
of ,,strategic alliances”, such as: company merger, creation of mixed societies, etc., enables
corporations to share the inherent risk of developing products for international markets and the
benefits resulted following the expansion of portfolio investments realized based on these products.

5. IMPORT AND EXPORT ON THE GLOBAL MARKET

A global market requires the existence of some significant levels of regulated exchanges of
goods and services at an interregional scale. Where the obstacles which prevent trade, be they
transportation costs or protectionist measures, registered a considerable decrease, foreign producers
from a certain region can compete with domestic producers from another region. The dynamics of
international trade is very strong. It attracts the globalization of industry, under the influence of two

close as possible to potential customers. This is the attitude of big international companies. On the
other hand, many enterprises are compelled to delocalize part of its production in order to reduce
the cost of the workforce. Thus, electronic produces most of its primary devices in South-East Asia.
The revolution in the field of communications enabled many big international companies, known as
transnational corporations, to decentralize their manufacturing process. They are now capable of to
locate their research and development where most scientists are available. Truly new is the growth
of global trade in the second half of the twentieth century. Many countries limited their restrictions
imposed on international trade and trans-borders circulation of goods expanded considerably. Trade
developed in a rhythm twice faster than that of global production. A vast opening of economies
towards the exterior was initiated. Between 1955 and 1975, Europe especially and then the world
economy, as a whole, registered the longest postwar boom, when the increase of the volume of
trade was associated with the strengthening of the position of multinational corporations situated on
the territory of Europe, the United States of America and, to a smaller extent, Japan.
In a globalised world, Europe‟s trade policy must become an integral part of its wider
approach to economic reform and competitiveness. A stronger EU economy at home means Europe
has to be more competitive abroad. We need to open markets and create new opportunities for trade
and ensure European companies are able to compete fairly in those markets. EU trade policy aims
to contribute to a more equitable integration of developing countries into the international trading
system through coherent action on three levels: the multilateral (which remains the key area of EU
trade policy), the bilateral and through autonomous measures.
In the following graphics we compare the exportation and importation in the period 20002006 in the main regions of the world.

The global exportation of goods and services tripled in the period 1992-2006. În graphic 1
we considered the merchandise export of the main regions of the world in 2000-2006. At present,
about 20% of the global production is traded and a much higher percentage constitutes, potentially,
the object of international competition: commercial activities reached an unprecedented level as an
absolute value, as well as in relation to global production. The structure of world trade in relation to
various types of commodities differed considerably in the last decades. The main tendency was that
of increase of the percentage of manufactured goods and services from the total of global exports.
The percentage of primary products, offered especially to the poorest countries, registered a
decrease.

The analysis of the geographical distribution of the importation and exportation of products
confirms the existence of three global poles: North America, Western Europe and South-East Asia,
which cover, taken together, two thirds of world trade. The great industrialized countries are at the
same time the biggest importers and exporters in the world, the United States of America being the
undisputed leader. A series of relatively small countries, especially from Asia, states considered
developing countries, registered great economic transformations in the last three decades, due to
their focus on exportation. In these cases, international trade functioned as a genuine vehicle or as
the main promoter of economic development. The recently industrialized countries in Asia
registered positive evolutions, whereas Africa, as a whole, had a declining trend.
In the section bellow we present the situation concerning the commercial services in
exportation and importation.

The World Bank estimated that a pro-poor outcome of the current Doha Development
Agenda could increase global income by up to € 300 bn, with half accruing to developing countries.
However, the world's poorest countries have not always been able to fully benefit from the trade
opportunities offered by the multilateral trading system.
Briefly, The World Bank has characterized the activities of importation/exportations of EU
in the following terms:
EU imports from developing countries have continued to rise. They increased by 16%
between 2005 and 2006 and by 14% if China is excluded. Imports from developing
countries with which the EU has Free Trade Agreements have also shown a healthy rise
between 2005 and 2006: from Mexico 15%, from South Africa 10% and from Chile 54%.
Almost 70% of imports from developing countries entered the EU at a zero tariff rate in
2006. This was the case for almost 98% of imports from the African, Caribbean and Pacific
countries (this figure will now increase because the signing of the Economic Partnership
Agreements has further extended duty-free treatment for ACP countries). 88.5% of Least
Developed Country imports to the EU entered at a zero tariff rate.
Agricultural exports from developing countries to the EU grew by just under 12% from
2005-2006. Textiles imports grew by 12.3% for the same period.
EU imports from the 50 Least Developed Countries (LDC) increased by just under 7%
2005-2006. The biggest increases in LDC exports to the EU were in textiles, which grew by
25%.


The globalisation imposes to Europe different challenges: the demographic deficit, the
reduction of the active population, the necessity of adaptation to the climatic change and the
armonisation with the technological change etc. The main issue is to face the inequalities
determined by the globalisation. The life long learning, the mobility, the social dialog, the
anticipation of the new needs, the flexibility, but also the keeping of the social protection are some
answers for the new challenges. The European Union has a financial mechanism which follows the
equilibration of the negative effects of the globalization - sharper distinction between winners and
losers at the international levels including greater disparities among both industrial and developing
countries, a higher external dependence, global warming and environmental destruction,
globalization of unsustainable patterns of production and consumption, reduction/loss of cultural
diversity, and rise of ill-directed nationalism and patriotism, leading to international terrorism and
the possibility of greater international conflicts - named The European Globalisation Adjustment
Found.

The assurance of safe and efficient borders;
The promoting of local actions - „man to man”.
The factors that are taken into consideration for the strengthening of a system of functional
regions, of potential success, and those for the development of regions are: historical factors, related
to tradition; cultural factors; the geographical factor (natural homogeneousness and the connection
with the state borders); the adequate dimension for real and efficient socio-economic activities; a
number of center of development/potential growth (city which are likely to develop with a bidirectional socio-economic dynamics in relation to the marginal area). Also, there are the market
factors, cost factors, governamental factors and competitiveness factors.

Research performed by well-known experts (for example, Dunford and Hudson) show that
the government decentralization in regions is not enough to guarantee economic success. They
discovered that the prosperous EU regions:
display a high level of social cohesion and participation ;
achieve relations of cooperation in the field of industry, which are illustrative of their
flexibility and security
have cooperation at the level of the companies, including a network of cooperation
“incorporate” internal investments, which have a considerable added value in the
regional economy

have government institutions, which have “learned to learn”
maximize the potential of trans-border synergies
manifest a vibrant, state accepted civil society

3. THE CONSEQUENCES OF REGIONALIZATION & GLOBALIZATION AT
EUROPEAN LEVEL

In many of the European regions with economic success, social cohesion and participation
appear as imperative conditions for economic success. The symbiotic relationship between cohesion
and success manifests itself in multiple ways, and many of them can be resumed as culture of
commitment, which gravitates around a variety of relations based on cooperation and trust. It is also
true that in some successful regions of Western Europe, the character of social inclusion is
obviously problematic – for example, many workers in the successful regions in Germany are
international migrants, with no citizen rights. This suggests the fact that economic success can be, in
some circumstances, dependent on the partial and selective opinions concerning cohesion. Many of

companies, which highlight cooperation, trust and network communication. Often, these networks
have the specific character of the place, as is the case of the industrial areas of interconnected small
and medium enterprises. Many small enterprises are dynamic and rely on innovative design, order
based production and quality, in order to be able to remain competitive. Network connection, based
on mutual trust, enables these companies to successfully adopt competitive strategies. Cooperation
networks facilitate training, innovation, the spreading of knowledge and the creation of specific
territorial types of knowledge, essential for competitiveness. There are ,however, significant
differences between these regions,

where “the horizontal” networks of SMEs are the main

advantage of the corporate picture (as is the case with the North-East and center of Italy) and those
dominated by major companies ( such as Baden-Württemberg). The relations of cooperation
between companies are centered on formal agreements, often complementary to the realization of
some performance objectives and less to a non-formal relation of trust. Nevertheless, the network
collaboration relations of large companies are at least partially transnational. Thus, this means that
“old” industries that exist in poor economic regions of Europe can become a basis for future
growth, if the appropriate organizational structures evolve. The globalization process and the
marketing approach of investments launched a new modality of “investments in companies that are
representative for a particular branch” in the marginal regions of the European Union, thus enabling
an economic activity with a greater added value and a tighter connection with economy and the
regional capacity. These schemes introduce, via the constitution of a “supply network”, a better
diversification of market risks (by abandoning market segments). Such a “quality” of attracted
investments can create an important number of new workplaces, and may have many other positive
effects on regional economy, even if it is necessary to emphasize the fact that investments in
companies belonging to this branch in the marginal regions of Europe will lead to the utilization of
the unqualified workforce for mass production. No one can deny the fact that the success of a
region depends on the government system and on the pro-active approach of local governments in
the socio-economic field, authorizing and facilitating the appearance of institutions, forming
partnerships with the civil society and the business community. These mechanisms enable the
elimination of borders and support the formation and the development of local/regional economies.
The governmental structures of the state should be ware of the fact that national economy is rooted
in regional/local economy and the regional/local models of development are, usually, incorporated
in successful national economies.


DIFFERENCE

BETWEEN

GLOBALIZATION

AND

REGIONALIZATION

It consists in the fact that, in the case of regionalization, liberalization occurs on a smaller
scale, geographically limited to the space of the states that participate in the grouping. Economic
data highlight the fact that the volume of inter-regional trade increases as fast as that of intranational trade, which proves that regionalization is an integral part of globalization. Poorly
developed countries advocate the idea of regional integration, arguing that its practical realization
represent the way towards industrialization, the liquidation of economic regress and the expansion
of the connections between the countries in the integrated areas. In this respect, one of the deputies
of the general manager of the International Monetary Fund, Alassane D. Quattara, states that
regional integration constitutes an important step towards global integration: “developing countries
cannot escape globalization and should not try to avoid it”. Trade played a significant part in the
globalization process, since the expansion of manufacturing in industrialized countries was due to
the accentuated interpenetration of national economies, to a large extent by means of intra-branch
trade, in such a way that global markets evolved in relation to processed products, as well as in
relation to their inputs. The increase of trade between developed and developing countries, in the
80s, also reflected a change in the nature of production. Thus, a new international labor division
was formed. Markets tend to become global due to the fact that internal markets are no longer
capable to bear the increasing costs of research and development and the shorter and shorter
lifecycles of the products, from a technological perspective. In an increasingly accentuated
modality, large corporations are expanding their scope outside their national borders, resorting to
transnational management in the field of innovation, manufacturing and trade. A genuine network
of ,,strategic alliances”, such as: company merger, creation of mixed societies, etc., enables
corporations to share the inherent risk of developing products for international markets and the
benefits resulted following the expansion of portfolio investments realized based on these products.

5. IMPORT AND EXPORT ON THE GLOBAL MARKET

A global market requires the existence of some significant levels of regulated exchanges of
goods and services at an interregional scale. Where the obstacles which prevent trade, be they
transportation costs or protectionist measures, registered a considerable decrease, foreign producers
from a certain region can compete with domestic producers from another region. The dynamics of
international trade is very strong. It attracts the globalization of industry, under the influence of two

close as possible to potential customers. This is the attitude of big international companies. On the
other hand, many enterprises are compelled to delocalize part of its production in order to reduce
the cost of the workforce. Thus, electronic produces most of its primary devices in South-East Asia.
The revolution in the field of communications enabled many big international companies, known as
transnational corporations, to decentralize their manufacturing process. They are now capable of to
locate their research and development where most scientists are available. Truly new is the growth
of global trade in the second half of the twentieth century. Many countries limited their restrictions
imposed on international trade and trans-borders circulation of goods expanded considerably. Trade
developed in a rhythm twice faster than that of global production. A vast opening of economies
towards the exterior was initiated. Between 1955 and 1975, Europe especially and then the world
economy, as a whole, registered the longest postwar boom, when the increase of the volume of
trade was associated with the strengthening of the position of multinational corporations situated on
the territory of Europe, the United States of America and, to a smaller extent, Japan.
In a globalised world, Europe‟s trade policy must become an integral part of its wider
approach to economic reform and competitiveness. A stronger EU economy at home means Europe
has to be more competitive abroad. We need to open markets and create new opportunities for trade
and ensure European companies are able to compete fairly in those markets. EU trade policy aims
to contribute to a more equitable integration of developing countries into the international trading
system through coherent action on three levels: the multilateral (which remains the key area of EU
trade policy), the bilateral and through autonomous measures.
In the following graphics we compare the exportation and importation in the period 20002006 in the main regions of the world.

The global exportation of goods and services tripled in the period 1992-2006. În graphic 1
we considered the merchandise export of the main regions of the world in 2000-2006. At present,
about 20% of the global production is traded and a much higher percentage constitutes, potentially,
the object of international competition: commercial activities reached an unprecedented level as an
absolute value, as well as in relation to global production. The structure of world trade in relation to
various types of commodities differed considerably in the last decades. The main tendency was that
of increase of the percentage of manufactured goods and services from the total of global exports.
The percentage of primary products, offered especially to the poorest countries, registered a
decrease.

The analysis of the geographical distribution of the importation and exportation of products
confirms the existence of three global poles: North America, Western Europe and South-East Asia,
which cover, taken together, two thirds of world trade. The great industrialized countries are at the
same time the biggest importers and exporters in the world, the United States of America being the
undisputed leader. A series of relatively small countries, especially from Asia, states considered
developing countries, registered great economic transformations in the last three decades, due to
their focus on exportation. In these cases, international trade functioned as a genuine vehicle or as
the main promoter of economic development. The recently industrialized countries in Asia
registered positive evolutions, whereas Africa, as a whole, had a declining trend.
In the section bellow we present the situation concerning the commercial services in
exportation and importation.

Merchandise trade expansion and quality improvement, intra-regional trade expansion,
easier and cost-effective access to international capital, technology and professional manpower
markets, expanding business opportunities overseas, enhanced international flows of people,
information, knowledge and ideas, leading to the concept of a global village represent the positive
impact of globalization (Hirono Ryokichi, 2006).

The World Bank estimated that a pro-poor outcome of the current Doha Development
Agenda could increase global income by up to € 300 bn, with half accruing to developing countries.
However, the world's poorest countries have not always been able to fully benefit from the trade
opportunities offered by the multilateral trading system.
Briefly, The World Bank has characterized the activities of importation/exportations of EU
in the following terms:
EU imports from developing countries have continued to rise. They increased by 16%
between 2005 and 2006 and by 14% if China is excluded. Imports from developing
countries with which the EU has Free Trade Agreements have also shown a healthy rise
between 2005 and 2006: from Mexico 15%, from South Africa 10% and from Chile 54%.
Almost 70% of imports from developing countries entered the EU at a zero tariff rate in
2006. This was the case for almost 98% of imports from the African, Caribbean and Pacific
countries (this figure will now increase because the signing of the Economic Partnership
Agreements has further extended duty-free treatment for ACP countries). 88.5% of Least
Developed Country imports to the EU entered at a zero tariff rate.
Agricultural exports from developing countries to the EU grew by just under 12% from
2005-2006. Textiles imports grew by 12.3% for the same period.
EU imports from the 50 Least Developed Countries (LDC) increased by just under 7%
2005-2006. The biggest increases in LDC exports to the EU were in textiles, which grew by
25%.


The globalisation imposes to Europe different challenges: the demographic deficit, the
reduction of the active population, the necessity of adaptation to the climatic change and the
armonisation with the technological change etc. The main issue is to face the inequalities
determined by the globalisation. The life long learning, the mobility, the social dialog, the
anticipation of the new needs, the flexibility, but also the keeping of the social protection are some
answers for the new challenges. The European Union has a financial mechanism which follows the
equilibration of the negative effects of the globalization - sharper distinction between winners and
losers at the international levels including greater disparities among both industrial and developing
countries, a higher external dependence, global warming and environmental destruction,
globalization of unsustainable patterns of production and consumption, reduction/loss of cultural
diversity, and rise of ill-directed nationalism and patriotism, leading to international terrorism and
the possibility of greater international conflicts - named The European Globalisation Adjustment
Found.

1. OVERVIEW

Economic interdependences became more frequent in the postwar period, manifesting in a
variety of forms that stimulate the adhesion process. In the second report of the Club of Rome,
coordinated by the laureate of the Nobel prize for economy, Jan Tinbergen, a series of
interdependences are highlighted and it is argued that they are generated by: the need for food,

considerable differences between the rich and the poor countries. From a generic perspective,
globalization expresses the process of expansion of social, economic and political activities across
the borders (national, then regional) in such a way that events that occur or decisions that are made
in a certain area of the world come to have an impact and influence the lives of people in the other
corner of the world. In light of the diversity of views and the absence of agreement on a single
definition of globalization, we define it here in a narrow sense to mean the process through which
the world‟s national economies, markets, and businesses are witnessing increasing connectivity. To
yet others globalization is seen as a process through which an international, multicultural,
borderless, and even information society is being constructed (Nshimbi Christopher Changwe,
2006, p.2)
The globalization, seen as a distinct, unique and unrepeatable process, appeared after the
second world war, when:
 were created the conditions for the polarization of the world in two major sides;
 appeared a new political world order through the creation of the Organization of the
United Nations, which was supposed, via its institutions and agencies, to provide the legal
and institutional frame for the preservation of peace and world security, the development
of amicable relations between nations and the realization of international cooperation for
the purposes of solving international problems with an economic, social, intellectual or
humanitarian aspect;
 the process of decolonization led to the formation of new states in the regions of SubSaharan Africa, Northern Africa and Middle East, South-East Asia and the Pacific.
From our perspective, the end of the Cold War also meant the end of the first stage of
contemporary globalization. Firstly, there is no political globalization of the world, based on some
universally accepted democratic principles. In this period, the existence of totalitarian states was
periodically threatened from the inside, as well as from the outside, the last decade of the Cold War
being the ultimate witness of the successful attempts of abolishing dictatorial regimes. We must not
forget the fact that there are still states under uni-personal, totalitarian regimes (Cuba, North Korea,
the countries dominated by Islamic fundamentalism). Secondly, in the postwar period, we would
rather talk (as far as we are concerned, as a continent) of sub-regional or zonal organizations
(Council for Mutual Economic Assistance and European Economic Community) that were not the
unique voice of the region – Europe, due to its totally opposite ideological principles regarding its
formation. Post Cold War globalization registered a considerable level of institutionalization,
replacing the rigid and bipolar division of the world with the multi-polarity that expressed itself as

but rather complementary processes. Globalization implies action in very vast, but concretely
delineated spaces, enabling common decisions at a regional level. Thirdly, the military globalization
registered in that period represented a limited evolution of the system of alliances and a rather
predictable structure of international security. The Cold War divided the world under several of its
aspects (economic, social and cultural life), but it also reunited it under the form of global military
order, called “the equilibrium of terror”.
Regionalisation, especially in its de jure forms involving greater or lesser degrees of formal
policy integration among governments, emerges as a political response to the challenges of
globalisation and at the same time helps to strengthen the microeconomic forces that drive
globalisation by stimulating internal competition; significantly enlarging regional markets open to
participants; weakening the power of special-interest groups which resist greater competition or
attempt to turn regional agreements into bastions of protection; and reestablishing collectively,
among participants, policy sovereignty vis-à-vis internal and global markets (Oman Charles, 1994,
p.4).
Regionalization is the realization of some regional trade arrangements with various degrees
of adhesion. Two values of regional integration can be identified for the postwar period: beginning
with the 50s, there were numerous attempts to create some free trade areas or common markets in
Europe, Africa, Latin America, the Caribbean Islands and Asia. Except for Europe, the attempts of
regional integration of the first wave failed. The regionalism of the second wave is a phenomenon
of the 90s. It is vaster than the first wave and it may have been provoked by the increasing
international interdependence and the progress in the field of communications. The second wave
consists in the attempts to create regional trade agreements, customs associations, customs unions
and common markets.

2. GLOBALIZATION AND THE REGIONAL SUCCESS

Although regionalization (the division in regions) is widely spread in the territorial
organization of European countries, it is impossible to define a common fundamental concept for all
existing regions. In some countries like, for example, Italy, the regions immediately became
functional, in other countries they serve as a means of actions of economic nature for the central
government. This was the case of France and Great Britain. The reforms of the reform attempts (in
Belgium, Spain, France and Portugal) in the period of the 70s transformed regionalization in the
main topic of political debates. Many states do not recognize the region as a new level of the

various elaborated concepts about the region. The regionalization of the new member states and of
the states that will adhere in the future contributed to the diversification of the term region. This is
why there is a tendency to hesitate between two fundamentally opposed and equally inappropriate
concepts. The first concept is based on a purely descriptive definition: the region is the entity
situated immediately under the level of central government, with a political power of representation,
via the selected board. The second concept is based on the representation of the region via an
association or institution created at a regional level by the immediately inferior authorities (as is
defined in the statute of the Reunion of European Regions).
The newest initiative in the regional politic domain is represented by the Communication of
the Commission from July 2003, reffering to the creation of a new instrument of promoting of the
sustainable economic and social development. It is about the ,,Neighbourhood Instrument”, which
appears as a consequence of the extending process of EU and reflects the interest for the Union
border change. This new instrument is based on the existing experience in promoting the crossborder cooperation, acumulated by Phare, Tacis and Interreg programs, and will be centred on the
assurance of the well functioning and a good management of the future borders in East, with the
purpose of development of the border regions.
This instrument can also contribute to the promovation of stability and prosperity inside and
outside the Union borders.
The objectives considered by this instrument are:
Promoting of economic and social development in the border regions;
The cooperation for treating the common needs, in fields like: environment
protection, public health, fighting against the organised crime;
The assurance of safe and efficient borders;
The promoting of local actions - „man to man”.
The factors that are taken into consideration for the strengthening of a system of functional
regions, of potential success, and those for the development of regions are: historical factors, related
to tradition; cultural factors; the geographical factor (natural homogeneousness and the connection
with the state borders); the adequate dimension for real and efficient socio-economic activities; a
number of center of development/potential growth (city which are likely to develop with a bidirectional socio-economic dynamics in relation to the marginal area). Also, there are the market
factors, cost factors, governamental factors and competitiveness factors.

globalization process, since the expansion of manufacturing in industrialized countries was due to
the accentuated interpenetration of national economies, to a large extent by means of intra-branch
trade, in such a way that global markets evolved in relation to processed products, as well as in
relation to their inputs. The increase of trade between developed and developing countries, in the
80s, also reflected a change in the nature of production. Thus, a new international labor division
was formed. Markets tend to become global due to the fact that internal markets are no longer
capable to bear the increasing costs of research and development and the shorter and shorter
lifecycles of the products, from a technological perspective. In an increasingly accentuated
modality, large corporations are expanding their scope outside their national borders, resorting to
transnational management in the field of innovation, manufacturing and trade. A genuine network
of ,,strategic alliances”, such as: company merger, creation of mixed societies, etc., enables
corporations to share the inherent risk of developing products for international markets and the
benefits resulted following the expansion of portfolio investments realized based on these products.

5. IMPORT AND EXPORT ON THE GLOBAL MARKET

A global market requires the existence of some significant levels of regulated exchanges of
goods and services at an interregional scale. Where the obstacles which prevent trade, be they
transportation costs or protectionist measures, registered a considerable decrease, foreign producers
from a certain region can compete with domestic producers from another region. The dynamics of
international trade is very strong. It attracts the globalization of industry, under the influence of two

close as possible to potential customers. This is the attitude of big international companies. On the
other hand, many enterprises are compelled to delocalize part of its production in order to reduce
the cost of the workforce. Thus, electronic produces most of its primary devices in South-East Asia.
The revolution in the field of communications enabled many big international companies, known as
transnational corporations, to decentralize their manufacturing process. They are now capable of to
locate their research and development where most scientists are available. Truly new is the growth
of global trade in the second half of the twentieth century. Many countries limited their restrictions
imposed on international trade and trans-borders circulation of goods expanded considerably. Trade
developed in a rhythm twice faster than that of global production. A vast opening of economies
towards the exterior was initiated. Between 1955 and 1975, Europe especially and then the world
economy, as a whole, registered the longest postwar boom, when the increase of the volume of
trade was associated with the strengthening of the position of multinational corporations situated on
the territory of Europe, the United States of America and, to a smaller extent, Japan.
In a globalised world, Europe‟s trade policy must become an integral part of its wider
approach to economic reform and competitiveness. A stronger EU economy at home means Europe
has to be more competitive abroad. We need to open markets and create new opportunities for trade
and ensure European companies are able to compete fairly in those markets. EU trade policy aims
to contribute to a more equitable integration of developing countries into the international trading
system through coherent action on three levels: the multilateral (which remains the key area of EU
trade policy), the bilateral and through autonomous measures.
In the following graphics we compare the exportation and importation in the period 20002006 in the main regions of the world.

The global exportation of goods and services tripled in the period 1992-2006. În graphic 1
we considered the merchandise export of the main regions of the world in 2000-2006. At present,
about 20% of the global production is traded and a much higher percentage constitutes, potentially,
the object of international competition: commercial activities reached an unprecedented level as an
absolute value, as well as in relation to global production. The structure of world trade in relation to
various types of commodities differed considerably in the last decades. The main tendency was that
of increase of the percentage of manufactured goods and services from the total of global exports.
The percentage of primary products, offered especially to the poorest countries, registered a
decrease.

The analysis of the geographical distribution of the importation and exportation of products
confirms the existence of three global poles: North America, Western Europe and South-East Asia,
which cover, taken together, two thirds of world trade. The great industrialized countries are at the
same time the biggest importers and exporters in the world, the United States of America being the
undisputed leader. A series of relatively small countries, especially from Asia, states considered
developing countries, registered great economic transformations in the last three decades, due to
their focus on exportation. In these cases, international trade functioned as a genuine vehicle or as
the main promoter of economic development. The recently industrialized countries in Asia
registered positive evolutions, whereas Africa, as a whole, had a declining trend.
In the section bellow we present the situation concerning the commercial services in
exportation and importation.

Merchandise trade expansion and quality improvement, intra-regional trade expansion,
easier and cost-effective access to international capital, technology and professional manpower
markets, expanding business opportunities overseas, enhanced international flows of people,
information, knowledge and ideas, leading to the concept of a global village represent the positive
impact of globalization (Hirono Ryokichi, 2006).

The World Bank estimated that a pro-poor outcome of the current Doha Development
Agenda could increase global income by up to € 300 bn, with half accruing to developing countries.
However, the world's poorest countries have not always been able to fully benefit from the trade
opportunities offered by the multilateral trading system.
Briefly, The World Bank has characterized the activities of importation/exportations of EU
in the following terms:
EU imports from developing countries have continued to rise. They increased by 16%
between 2005 and 2006 and by 14% if China is excluded. Imports from developing
countries with which the EU has Free Trade Agreements have also shown a healthy rise
between 2005 and 2006: from Mexico 15%, from South Africa 10% and from Chile 54%.
Almost 70% of imports from developing countries entered the EU at a zero tariff rate in
2006. This was the case for almost 98% of imports from the African, Caribbean and Pacific
countries (this figure will now increase because the signing of the Economic Partnership
Agreements has further extended duty-free treatment for ACP countries). 88.5% of Least
Developed Country imports to the EU entered at a zero tariff rate.
Agricultural exports from developing countries to the EU grew by just under 12% from
2005-2006. Textiles imports grew by 12.3% for the same period.
EU imports from the 50 Least Developed Countries (LDC) increased by just under 7%
2005-2006. The biggest increases in LDC exports to the EU were in textiles, which grew by
25%.


The globalisation imposes to Europe different challenges: the demographic deficit, the
reduction of the active population, the necessity of adaptation to the climatic change and the
armonisation with the technological change etc. The main issue is to face the inequalities
determined by the globalisation. The life long learning, the mobility, the social dialog, the
anticipation of the new needs, the flexibility, but also the keeping of the social protection are some
answers for the new challenges. The European Union has a financial mechanism which follows the
equilibration of the negative effects of the globalization - sharper distinction between winners and
losers at the international levels including greater disparities among both industrial and developing
countries, a higher external dependence, global warming and environmental destruction,
globalization of unsustainable patterns of production and consumption, reduction/loss of cultural
diversity, and rise of ill-directed nationalism and patriotism, leading to international terrorism and
the possibility of greater international conflicts - named The European Globalisation Adjustment
Found.
