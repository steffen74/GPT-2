1 Introduction
The ever-growing population worldwide and their consumption of basic need goods (such as fast-moving consumer goods, beverages, cleaning products) pose new
challenges for research in distribution planning. These
goods are commonly produced in batches due to their low
unit volume. In order to meet the requirements for high
consumption rate, optimum distribution plans for batch
products have to be generated across different locations.
An effective and efﬁcient management of batch ﬂow leads
to huge savings in absolute terms for both the companies
and the consumers [10]. Additionally, the growth in road
trafﬁc and the use of road freight transport raise the level of
emitted greenhouse gases (GHG) in the environment. As
one of today’s top market concerns, all aspects of an
organization’s logistics must be green [15]. This shift
towards greening the supply chain through an environmentally friendly logistics network design is not only to
abide by governmental regulations but also to meet customers’ expectations and social responsibilities [22].
Distribution planning can support decision making by
generating the optimum routes, minimizing the total
transportation costs as well as saving energy and, consequently, GHG emissions. The optimum delivery routes for
each vehicle are generated at the tactical level (route
planning) and the optimum delivery velocities at the
operational level (schedule planning). Therefore, the model
described in this paper is formulated as two-stage
stochastic model. The model integrates the decisions made

impact of transport activities. Also, GHG emissions under
uncertainties are incorporated as a function of randomly
selected delivery velocities at different distribution routes
within the supply network. The vehicle velocity has the
most signiﬁcant effects on fuel consumption [20]. Thus,
optimal speed could lead to greater reduction of CO2
emissions and fuel consumption for a given routing plan
[6].
Although there are a number logistics models in the
literature, there is a lack of research into real-life applications underpinned by case studies [23]. The current study
validates a newly developed green logistics model via two
real-world case studies of multinational organizations
drawn from the batch process industry.
This paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 reviews the
extant literature on implementation of green logistics
models in batch distribution. This section also describes the
case studies and the background to the study. Section 3
deﬁnes the methodology and the development of optimum
distribution routes, optimum delivery velocities and related
CO2 emissions. Computational results and discussions are
presented in Sect. 4. Finally, the conclusions and main
ﬁndings are highlighted in Sect. 5.

2 Greening batch distribution: literature review
There has been a marked increase in the consumption of
goods produced using batch processes. This has resulted in
a commensurate rise in production and related distribution
operations [21]. Consequently, these related distribution
operations have contributed immensely to the total global
transport emissions. According to Buehler and Pucher [2],
a ﬁfth of worldwide GHG emissions are due to transport
activities. In fact, the transportation sector will be the
second largest emitter accounting for 24 % of the total EU
emissions in 2020. Therefore, there is a renewed sense of
urgency to investigate the environmental parameters during
transport operations and develop appropriate distribution
planning models [12]. Scheduling most of the distribution
plans is based on the vehicle routing problem (VRP) [17].
The VRP is a classical combinatorial optimization problem
that has become a key component of distribution and
logistics management. Through VRPs, the reduction in
total vehicle’s travelled distance, by itself, provides environmental beneﬁts. This is due to the reduction in fuel
consumption, the consequent drop in pollutants and resultant shorter lead times [3, 5, 7].
In recent research contributions, there have been a
number of models suggested to minimize the emissions of
GHG associated with vehicle routing problems based on
vehicle velocities. The velocity of vehicles is the major





determinant of environmental emissions for a speciﬁc
vehicle load [6]. The usage of speed to minimize emissions
in VRP models can be classiﬁed into two main categories:
the ﬁrst is the set of models where vehicle speeds are inputs
to the model and the second consists of models where
vehicle speed values are optimized and used as decision
variables.
Furthermore, Kumar et al. [13] pointed out the
necessity of implementing integrated optimization models that combine operational and environmental costs
elements in real case studies. Moreover, implementing
these models in real environment plays a vital role in
exploring their validity in achieving environmentally
sustainable logistics practices [9]. As an application of
green logistics concept in the batch process industry,
Ubeda et al. [23] examined aspects of green transportation at the operational level where vehicles speeds are
inputs and proposed some green changes within the VRP
based on a case study at one of the leading distribution
companies in Spain. They found that an average saving of
25.5 % in CO2 emissions was possible due to reduction in
used routes compared to the prevailing situation in that
company at the time.
Moreover, Pishvaee et al. [19] proposed a bi-objective
fuzzy mathematical programming model for green logistics
design under uncertain conditions. Their model integrated
the transportation and production strategic decisions, and
its applicability was examined in an industrial case study.
As their decisions were at the strategic level, velocity
speeds were reported as inputs as well. In contrast, Maden
et al. [14], using vehicle speed as decision variables,
minimized the total vehicle emissions per unit distance
required for distribution operations. A CO2 saving of
around 7 % was recorded using a tabu search algorithm.
Similarly, Qian and Eglese [20] minimized the fuel emissions in a road network where speed of each vehicle along
each road in its path is treated as decision variables.
The integrated model presented in this paper is novel
given that velocity values were used both as inputs and
decision variables in an optimization model. A two-stage
stochastic model is designed to generate the global optimum solution for both tactical and operational decision
levels. In the ﬁrst stage, the vehicle velocities are known
only within certain bounds and considered as inputs to the
model. The optimum values for these velocities are
uncertain at this stage. Once the optimum routes are
known, the delivery velocities are used as decision variables in the second stage. The optimum delivery velocities
which correspond to the minimum emission values are then
generated. Integrating emission values within the modelling of distribution plans is essential in order to achieve a
sustainable balance between economic and environmental
studies is as crucial as developing these approaches and
models, data were collected from two real-world case
studies of multinational batch process companies. In each
case study, data used for the numerical analysis belong to
one full month of activities. The data showed a regular
trend.
In the next sections, we will focus on generating the
optimal vehicle routing that would enable reduction of the
environmental impact by optimizing the distribution planning. Thereafter, we will propose a practical framework
which considers both tactical and operational decisions.
We will also discuss the implementation of this framework
using the two case studies.

3 Methodology and case studies
In this section, the methodology used to handle batch
distributions is described. This section composes two
subsections: deﬁning the environmental values and developing the mathematical model. Afterwards, the model is
implemented in two case studies from batch process
industry in order to verify the applicability of the model in
practice. The characteristics of the test problems and some
implementation details are described. The optimal delivery
routes sequencing, the corresponding numbers of required
delivery trucks and the optimum delivery speeds required
to achieve the environmental targets were then determined.
3.1 Environmental values
Although there is no standard way to measure the values of
fuel consumption and GHG emissions for a mobile source,
a number of formulas could be applied to easily calculate
their approximate values. Generally, there are two ways to
calculate CO2 emissions: fuel-based or distance-based
methodology [23]. While the fuel-based method is more
reliable, the distance-based method is more popular due to
the type of the data required. The distance-based method of
estimating CO2 emissions will be used in this article due to
readily available data. Two recorded values are required to
calculate emissions based on this method: the distance
travelled (Dlk) and fuel consumption (EMlk) by vehicles
[23]. Additionally, this research used values of velocities
instead of distances.
Delivery velocities are deﬁned as vectors of uncertain
values on each route (between any two nodes in the network) in each period. This vector can be mathematically
formulated as follows: X = (MinV, MaxV) where
MinV and MaxV correspond to the minimum and maximum vehicle velocity. It is expected that each vehicle is
driven with velocity (Vtlk) and results in amount of

Page 3 of 10 9

emissions (Etlk). A range of MinE and MaxE corresponds
to a range of delivery vehicle velocities MaxVtlk (x) and
MinVtlk (x) where x is a given value of uncertain
parameters. If these values are not practically applicable,
penalties for overage emissions Flk (paid to the governments) and that for underage emissions Glk (associated with
delivery delays for customers) are imposed. The idea
behind this deﬁnition of penalties is to obtain meaningful
combinations of companies and customers concerns. From
the companies’ perspective, the goal is to deliver the batches to different customers as efﬁciently as possible
(concerning economic cost and overage emissions which
are paid to the governments). From the customers’ point of
view, the main concern is to reliably receive the deliveries
on time. Therefore, the objective function has emissions
limits and stochastic travel velocities, leading to stochastic
arrival times.
3.2 The mathematical formulation
The proposed study presents a research methodology with a
mathematical core based on both the economic and environmental data as well as the capacity constraints. Six-step
procedure was applied to realize the proposed solution
methodology as shown in Fig. 1. The ﬁrst step is to build a
model which captures the properties of the production
process and its corresponding ﬂows of materials. The
second step is to extract all the required data in order to
generate feasible production plans at minimum costs.
Afterwards, the decision-maker at the plant uses this data
as well as further knowledge or expectations about the
current and future situation on the shop ﬂoor to generate a
set of assumptions. These inputs are called scenarios. Then,
an initial solution is generated for each given scenario. The
ﬁfth step is to analyse the production schedule and interactive modiﬁcations of the developed model based on the
experience and knowledge of the decision-maker and the
feasibility of the production plans. The sixth and last step
in this procedure is to approve the generated solution. This
approval is based on the decision-maker evaluation for all
available alternatives. In reality, these steps should be
followed by execution and updating.
In order to fulﬁl the demand of customers in L locations,
there are several products P which are produced and
grouped into batches during T time periods. The distribution problem is modelled on a full graph G = (V, L), where
V = {1, 2,…,n} as the set of vertices, and L = {(l,k): l,
k[L, l = k} as the set of arcs. The formulated problem
exhibits the following characteristics: (a) known homogeneous ﬂeet size (each vehicle has a capacity indicated by
CAP), (b) single depot (denoted as Vo), (c) deterministic
demand (each customer has a certain demand Atlp which
should be delivered by their due dates DDp), (d) oriented

The objective function contains a deterministic term cT x
and the expectation of the second-stage objective
qðxÞT yðxÞ taken over all realizations of the random event
x. The ﬁrst-stage decisions are represented by the vector x
and matrices c, b and A. In the second stage, a number of
random events x 2 X (X denotes the set of all possible
scenarios and x a particular scenario) may be realized. For
each x, the value yðxÞ is the solution of a linear programme. For a given realization x, the second-stage
problem data qðxÞ; hðxÞ; and T ðxÞ become known. Each
component of q; h; and T is thus a possible random
variable.
In the developed stochastic optimization model, the
delivery velocities and their corresponding greenhouse
gas emissions are considered as uncertain parameters. The
second-stage decision variables are Etlk ðxÞ the total
carbon emissions value in route between locations l and k
in time period t. Total produced carbon emissions over
(OEtlk ðxÞ) and under (UEtlk ðxÞ) are the permissible limits
in route between locations l and k in time period t; Etlk ðxÞ
are deﬁned. Additionally, we deﬁne binary decision
variables Ztlk (l = k), equal to 1 if and only if the route f
location l to location k will be used in time period t and 0
otherwise. Given the previous problem deﬁnition, the
resulting formulation is given in the following steps by
(5)–(20).

cost from the depot to these locations can vary (a unit
transportation cost DClk is a function of the vehicle travelled distance for delivering the customer orders) and
(f) objective: minimizing total distribution costs.
Given this uncertainty, the two-stage stochastic programming model is developed because the model deals
with two levels of decisions. Both stages present the tactical and operational decisions. The uncertainties are
mostly found in the operational stage since most operational parameters are not fully known when the tactical
decisions have to be made. The scenario-based approach is
used in this paper to model the problem under uncertainty.

Equation (5) is the objective function to be minimized
including the total distribution costs of distribution across
the tactical stage, in addition to the expectation of the
second-stage (recourse value) problem across the operational stage. Constraints (6) and (7) ensure that each
location [except the depot] is visited exactly once in each
time period. Furthermore, constraints (8), (9) and (10)
generate the optimal route sequencing. Moreover, constraint (11) controls the delivering capacity, while constraint (12) ensures that enough vehicles are sent out of
the depot. Constraint (13) sets the binary restrictions for
the ﬁrst-stage binary variables, and constraint (14) is the
non-negativity constraint for all ﬁrst-stage continuous
variables.
The second-stage objective function (15) minimizes the
total costs associated speed and their related emissions,
penalties for overage and underage emissions. Constraint
(16) ensures that the chosen velocity at each route in each
time period at each scenario is between the realized minimum and maximum velocities on that route. Constraint
(17) calculates the total emissions level of each chosen
route. Constraints (18) and (19) calculate the overage or
underage emissions, respectively, based on the comparison
between the actual emissions that would result due to the
chosen velocity and the standard emissions limits. Constraint (20) is the non-negativity constraint for the secondstage variables.

3.3 Case studies
In order to check the applicability of the developed model
in practice as identiﬁed in Sect. 3.2, a qualitative approach
has been used based on a case study analysis. The mathematical model is tested in various scenarios of real-world
case studies from batch process industry. The case studies
selection approach has been motivated based on the
information-oriented process [8]. In this approach, the
information content should be withdrawn into two phases:
preliminary set of companies’ selection and participation
willingness in research.
In the ﬁrst phase, online database containing information about multinational companies was used. The selection
of the initial set of companies was based on the following
speciﬁc criteria: (a) producing in batches, (b) providing
different in the range of batches, (c) foster a vocation to
social responsibility and environmental-friendly management, (d) involved in previous research projects in order to
facilitate the information ﬂow and (e) their data follow a
regular trend, except during the holidays. Thus, sample of
those data can be generalized to represent the batch process
industry. A list of nine companies was selected as possible
cases due to these criteria.
In the second phase, an enquiry was conducted to secure
the acceptance of companies to participate in this research
and to check the above listed criteria. Out of ﬁve companies agreed to be involved in the case study investigation,
only two case studies from batch process industry are
suitable for this research.
The ﬁrst case study was conducted in one of the world’s
leading companies in the ﬁeld of foods and beverages
processing industry with employs more than 1500
employees. This company is a single huge plant with seven
departments. Currently, the core business of the company
includes processing and distribution of wide range of dairy
and frozen products packaged under more than 40 brand
names. Across 62 countries around the world, these products are ordered in batches. In 2005, the company was
determined to be one step ahead on social responsibility
and environmental-friendly management issues. It started
by using new materials during the production processes,
importing eco-efﬁciency methods and increasing employee
involvement. Recently, the management has focused on
developing solutions which consider the environmental
impact of their distribution activities particularly in the
ﬁeld of reducing emission-related issues.
The second case study was conducted in a multinational
consumer goods company and manufacturer of product
ranges including personal care, household cleaning, laundry detergents, prescription drugs and disposable nappies.

more than 80 brands across more than 70 countries all over
the world. Since 1999, the company has provided products
of superior quality and value that improve the lives of the
world’s consumers. Their sustainability objective is to
create industry-leading value with consumer-preferred
brands and products while conserving resources, protecting
the environment and improving the social conditions. By
2010, the company has reduced the total CO2 emissions by
about 14 % per unit of production. Currently, they focus to
make progress by optimizing the distribution routes and
involving economic, environmental and social sustainability objectives during the planning and distribution
processes.
In both case studies, demand and supply follow a regular
trend. Based on the customers’ demands, the number of
required delivery vehicles is calculated. The current distribution strategy is to ship all the requirements of the
target customer using homogeneous trucks, single-size
vehicles and single-delivery shipment. All batches are
packaged in a standard load pack before distribution. The
unit load stacked at each pallet is 7 kg. Therefore, the
amount of each product carried in a pallet varies from one
product type to another. This amount differs depending on
the batch type, dimensions and size. Each vehicle is a
twenty-foot equivalent unit. The numbers of pallets that
can ﬁt on a vehicle are 11. For the used heavy duty trucks
which emit four times more than passenger cars on average
[11], GHG emissions values are 1.726 kg CO2 per vehiclemile, 0.021 g CH4 per vehicle-mile and 0.017 g N2O per
vehicle-mile at the average velocity (50 mph) (Climate
Leaders GHG Inventory [4]). These values demonstrate
that CO2 represents more than 99 % by mass of all the
gaseous components of exhaust. Based on these values, the
emission factor (Bl) is estimated for each case study.

4 Implementation, results and discussions
In this section, we will discuss results obtained from the
implementation of the mathematical model in the case
studies. Furthermore, the quality of the stochastic programming solution will be compared to those obtained
using a deterministic approach. Then, the decision of the
delivery velocities and related CO2 emissions as environmental parameter will be numerically analysed.
In the ﬁrst case study, the model was implemented in
the liquid department. The selection of this department
was based on its good reputation with about 30 % of the
market share. Within that department, three types of liquids are produced: long-life processed milk, ﬂavoured
milk and long-life juices. Each of these liquids is packaged under different brand names with different volumes.





The second case study was carried out in the beauty, hair
and personal care liquids section. The developed model
was implemented in the shampoo department (of the
liquids section) which brought the company about 8 % of
its income.
All the required characteristics which are related to
demand, routes, depot, distribution nodes and vehicles
were collected. These characteristics generate the inputs to
the mathematical model as shown in Fig. 2 and Table 1.
Figure 2 shows that the geographical ﬁeld (to scale) of
each case study represents the distance between all pairs of
nodes including the depot (manufacturing facility). All the
possible connections between nodes have been taken into
consideration while generating the distribution network.
Any node can be served directly from the depot or after
another delivery points according to the optimum routes
and vehicle capacity. Moreover, speed limits of these
routes were noted and used to calculate the emission-related values.
The model is solved using the standard sequential linear
programming. As the model class is an integer linear
programming (ILP), the global optimum solution is stated
using branch and bound algorithm (i.e. the solver type is
branch and bound). The model is linear in both the ﬁrst and
second stages. All computations were run using the
LINGOÒ 10.0 optimization package on a machine with
CORETM i5 2.6 GHz processor and 4 GB RAM under
Windows 7 Enterprise.
For the distribution decisions, distribution plans were
generated. These plans were then presented in the form of
the optimal delivery routes. These routes should be driven
to distribute the production quantities to the different
locations according to customers’ needs. The values of the
binary decision variable Ztlk yielded these distribution
routes. The results of the second stage were also optimized.
The values of the optimum velocity and its related emission
quantities were determined. These values are yielded only
when the route is selected—when the vehicles’ routing
decision variable value Ztlk equals one. The main results are
summarized in Table 2.
After obtaining the optimal solution, the analysis of the
outcomes is performed to show the importance of modelling the presented framework in this way. This analysis
involves: (a) evaluating the usefulness of the stochastic
modelling approach instead of a deterministic one and
(b) sensitivity analysis of the velocity because it is the
most inﬂuential model parameter around the optimal
values.
Commonly, due to the computational difﬁculty of
solving the stochastic models, the usefulness of the
stochastic modelling approach is always questionable. To
check the suitability of using stochastic programming, the

deterministic optimization problem are quantiﬁed. For
stochastic models, when multiple runs of the models are
averaged out, it still cannot be concluded that the output
will also be the same. But after looking at the deﬁnition of
the models and how the results are produced, it is possible
to get a better understanding of how models will behave
under different inputs and different scenarios [24].
In order to obtain the deterministic values of the
developed model, the stochastic values of the delivery
velocities and their related emission values are replaced by
their average values. Therefore, the environmental objective function and constraints will be reformulated as
follows:

Furthermore, two values should be calculated: the

which the corresponding expected value (EV) replaced the
observation of the random values. The difference between
the RP and EEV is deﬁned as the value of the stochastic
solution (VSS). The VSS is the concept that precisely
measures the quality of a decision [1].
To display these values, datasets of 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50
scenarios were tested. Table 3 shows the values of running
these numbers of scenarios and their corresponding running
time. For each dataset, the RP, EEV and VSS values are calculated. Moreover, the VSS as a percentage of the overall RP
solution is reported. Since all VSS have positive values,
dealing with uncertainty really matters. Therefore, optimal
solutions are sensitive to the value of the random elements.
The difference between the optimal solution (generated from
the stochastic modelling) and the expected solution (generated
form the deterministic modelling) is between 13 and 4 percentages for datasets of 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 scenarios. The
VSS values verify the signiﬁcance and beneﬁts of using the
stochastic modelling approach. In the deterministic model, the
average delivery velocity (km/h) was 75 and the average
emission factor (kg CO2/km/h) was 1.2 in both case studies.
Moreover, the delivery velocity of the base in the second
stage in the developed stochastic model is examined. The
generated emissions during distribution depend mainly on
the delivery velocity as mentioned earlier. The optimum
transporting velocity values were generated in the case
studies. When the required batches are delivered faster than
the optimum, more emissions are generated which is
directly proportional to emission costs. Table 4 shows the
effect of changing the delivery velocities in the distribution
phases on the total cost.
Results show that the change of the velocity negatively
or positively results in the increase in the value of the total
cost. However, decreasing the velocity parameter increases
the costs at a higher rate more than the effect of increasing
this factor. The optimal solution guarantees that the output
schedule generated with the least cost value. The conclusion is that the optimum solution is more sensitive to
decreasing the delivery velocity time than increasing it.

The total cost surges when the velocities fall due to rise in
the lateness penalty. On the other hand, when the velocities
increase, the total cost escalates due to heightened level of
the emission penalty.
In sum, the results of the model analysis show that it can
generate the optimal solution for the batch process industry.
This is veriﬁed and successfully implemented in two real-life
industrial case studies that prove the model’s capability as a
decision support system which addresses both routing and
scheduling distribution decisions. Using the previous scenarios, the ﬂexibility of the proposed integrated green model
is proved while taking into consideration most of the special
features in the batch process industry.

5 Conclusions
The main goal of this study is to show the potential of the
introduction of a green logistics model in batch process
values and the related emissions has been proved.
On the one hand, the importance of optimizing transport
planning was shown in cost and emission savings. Based
on the results, a batch process facility improves its efﬁciency objectives from economic and ecological perspectives. On the other hand, the optimal transporting velocity
ranges should be strictly observed during logistics physical
activities. Due to the uncertain dynamic environment,
controlling delivery velocities is not that easy in practice.
For these reasons, extra costs must be incurred in training
and education of human resources who are involved in the
distribution processes in order to increase their level of
green awareness and knowledge. This could be studied in
depth for further research.
Furthermore, the proposed model supports academic
green logistics models and real-world supply chain decision making in batch process industry. Developing and
implementing the proposed green logistics model provide a
practical tool which links being green and being economically successful. Within the globalized market, greening
the batch supply chain through an environmentally friendly
logistics network design guarantees competitive advantages and meets the customers’ expectations and social
responsibilities requirements.
In addition, the model can also be applied to other
companies in order to assess the accuracy of the conclusions reached in this paper. Further research may also lead
to ﬁnding cleaner routes, through the development of exact
or approximate algorithms. Additionally, adding other
sources of uncertainties within the distribution phases will
positively enrich the credibility of this model. In this
dynamic environment, uncertainties are represented by the
gap between the planned and actual system status. This gap
shows a new challenge for the management of complex and
dynamics supply chain processes. Finally, deﬁning a useable way to obtain real measures for CO2 emissions will
highly improve the accuracy of the results and therefore the
decision of the driver during delivery.
There are many prospects for further research on this
work. One is involving the green aspects in the production
stage, rather than just in the distribution phase. A second
addition could be using different emission estimation ways
and comparing them altogether. A third extension is adding
other sources of uncertainty, such as the production costs
and capacities. A fourth and ﬁnal direction could be calculating the effect of considering the social criteria such as
improving labour conditions and human rights.
