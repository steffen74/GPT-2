Impact of environmental and social attitudes,
and family concerns on willingness to pay for improved
air quality: a contingent valuation application
in Mexico City

Air pollution remains a pressing issue in megacities located in developing countries.
Mexico City Metropolitan Area (MCMA) is an infamous case. Pollution levels in
MCMA regularly surpass limits suggested by the World Health Organization (CAI
2013). Also, MCMA has been ranked as the second most congested city in the world
during 2014.1 Effects of air pollution on the respiratory system have long been
˜
documented in MCMA (e.g. Escamilla-Nunez et al. 2008; Romieu et al. 2008).
Recent epidemiological studies report neuro-inﬂammation in otherwise healthy
´
˜
children residing in MCMA (Calderon-Garciduenas et al. 2008). In general, air
pollution produces larger health impacts in Mexico city than in similar cities located
in a developed country (Arceo-Gomez et al. 2012).
Public policies aiming to reduce air pollution have proved unsuccessful in
MCMA. Launched in 1989, Hoy No Circula (HNC) program represents the most
important governmental effort aiming to reduce pollution levels in MCMA.2 HNC
limits the number of weekdays a car is driven in Mexico City. HNC tackles the use
of cars because it is the largest contributor to air pollution in MCMA—45% of
volatile organic compounds and 81% of total nitrogen oxides (Molina and Molina
2002). Empirical studies have reported no impact from HNC on air pollution levels
and an undesirable positive impact on numbers of cars driven (Gallego et al.
2013a, b; Davis 2008). Authorities frequently implement a pre-contingency plan
that imposes temporary driving restrictions.3 The most recent attempt to improve air
quality, consisting in extending HNC to Saturdays, has been launched in July 2014.
A question arises in this context—what is the WTP of a resident of MCMA for
improved air quality? This paper elicits WTP for improved air quality by means of a
single-bounded, referendum format contingent valuation question. Respondents state
their willingness to monetarily contribute to improve air levels from observed regular
quality to good quality. This paper pays particular attention to differences in WTP
´
explained by individuals attitudes and concerns in three realms—environmental, social,
´
and family. The economic literature has already established the relevance of individuals
attitudes and concerns as factors behind variability in WTP (e.g. Bartczak 2015;
´
˜
Martınez-Espineira and Lyssenko 2011; Spash 2006; Spash et al. 2009). This paper
illustrates this relevance in the Mexican context. To measure attitudes, respondents are
asked to state their opinion on how important is the air pollution problem and the
poverty/economic development problem. To measure concerns, respondents are asked
to report (1) whether a family member (including himself) suffers an allergy or a
respiratory illness; (2) whether there is a car at the household; and (3) family size.
Average WTP in this paper—US $262 (2008 US dollars)—falls close to comparable
estimates reported in previous studies. For instance, Hanna and Oliva (2015) report US

WTP associated with environmental and social attitudes, and family concerns. For
instance, while respondents posing a very high priority to the air pollution problem have
higher than average WTP (US $302), respondents in a household with more adults than
the sample median (i.e. 2) have a lower than average WTP (US $214). While
respondents posing a very high priority to the poverty/economic development problem
have smaller than average WTP (US $222), respondents with a family member suffering
allergies or respiratory illness have higher than average WTP (US $295). Indeed, this
contingent valuation exercise provides elements to carry out cost–beneﬁt analysis of
policies aiming to improve air quality in MCMA—e.g. expansion of metro system,
maintenance or replacement of sources of liquid petroleum gas leaks, taxi renovation,
´
and use of hybrid buses (see Garcıa-Robles 2010; McKinley et al. 2005). Instances of
cost–beneﬁt analysis based on these estimates are presented in the discussion section.

2 Valuation methodology
Data are gathered through a contingent evaluation elicitation. Contingent evaluation
elicitations have widely been used in countries facing air quality problems—e.g.
Taiwan (Alberini et al. 1997), China (Wang and Zhang 2009), and Sweden
(Carlsson and Johansson-Stenman 2000). A single-bounded, referendum format
elicitation has been implemented in this study. This type of elicitation describes a
hypothetical market as a referendum in which respondents are asked whether they
would vote for or against a project in a public vote (Kling et al. 2012). Advantages
of this type of question include theoretical incentive compatibility, conceptual
simplicity, and similarity to a real-life decision mechanism. Single-bounded
questions, however, do not yield the most statistically efﬁcient WTP estimates.
Increase in statistical efﬁciency is obtained through double-bounded (Hanemann
et al. 1991) and one-and-one-half-bounded (Cooper et al. 2002) approaches. These
alternatives share several inconveniences with the single-bounded approach—warm
glow effect, anchoring, sensitivity to scope, and hypothetical bias (Carson 2012;
Carson et al. 2001; Bateman et al. 2009). In addition, one-and-half-bounded
approach may be non-incentive compatible (Bateman et al. 2009).
Both conceptual simplicity and similarity to a real-life decision mechanism have
driven the selection of single-bounded approach in this study. Both features
facilitate administration and execution, particularly in developing countries where
contingent valuation applications are still uncommon.4 Administration and

While Mexico is an OECD member, this paper follows recommendations targeting developing countries
because contingent valuation studies in Mexico are still rare. A non-exhaustive search yielded 15 published
studies in which Mexican respondents stated WTP through a contingent valuation question or a discrete
´
choice experiment. Papers focused on water-related issues include Almendarez-Hernandez et al. (2013),
´
´
´
˜
˜
Aviles-Polanco et al. (2010); Perez-Verdin et al. (2011); Rivera-Planter and Munoz-Pina (2005), Sanchez´
Brito et al. (2013), Soto-Montes de Oca et al. (2006), and Vasquez et al. (2009). A few studies have
researched preferences of farmers with respect to natural resources (Birol et al. 2009; Scarpa et al. 2003).
Additional topics cover valuation of food safety (Tonsor et al. 2009), smoking cessation treatment (HerediaPi et al. 2012), cross-border health insurance (Vargas-Bustamante et al. 2008), environmentally certiﬁed
´
valuation instrument (Whittington 2002). Conceptual simplicity and comparability
to a real-life situation eases explanation and understanding for both enumerators and
respondents. A single-bounded approach is also less time-consuming which
increases the response rate.
The elicitation protocol used in this paper ﬁrst elicits respondents’ attitudes.
Respondents were asked to rank how important are air pollution and poverty/
economic development problems to Mexico. Respondents separately ranked the
level of importance by choosing one of four categories—very important, important,
slightly important, and not important at all.
Then a summary of air pollution effects on human health is presented.
Respondents are explained how air pollution is measured in Mexico and informed
about air pollution levels in Mexico City during a normal year.
Then a strategy to improve air quality is described. This strategy would introduce
ﬁlters to the exhaust systems of cars and industry. In addition, a limit would be
imposed to the sulfur in fossil fuels of residential and industrial use. This strategy
would bring pollutants’ concentrations down from observed regular quality levels to
good quality levels. This change in air quality would save around 2200 lives and
avoid 37,000 hospital admissions yearly.
The protocol explains the government is considering putting this plan to a vote.
Respondents are informed that they would partially cover costs of implementing this
policy. The phrasing of the elicitation question is as follows: taking into
consideration that the strategy described above will increase your annual expenses
by ____, would you be willing to support this strategy if the government put it to a
vote?
Socioeconomic characteristics and family concerns are gathered in the last
section of the protocol. Respondents report whether someone in his/her family
(including his/herself) suffers from allergies or a respiratory illness. Respondents
also report whether a car is owned by someone in the family. Owning a car is
considered a family concern because, in order to comply with HNC requirements,
owners must face annual expenses and transactional costs—sometimes involving a
bribe to personnel in charge of car’s inspections (Oliva, 2012). The number of
household members is also a family concern. The respondent is asked for the
number of adults and children at home.

3 Data
3.1 Collection
Data were gathered from mid-December 2007 to mid-January 2008. A random
sample of 1812 individuals was approached in public places—e.g. malls, parks, and
´
small businesses—located in Delegacion Gustavo A. Madero (DGAM), a county in
Mexico City. Two features make DGAM an insightful case for the purposes of this
study: air pollution levels and relative economic development. That is, DGAM
where unequal economic development is expected to yield a trade-off between
environmental and social attitudes, and family concerns.
DGAM consistently ranks among the most polluted counties of MCMA since
early 1990s (SMAGDF 2009; Proaire 2001;). This feature makes air pollution a
local environmental issue for inhabitants of DGAM. Although Mexico city as a
whole struggles with air pollution, pollution levels in the south of Mexico City are
regularly lower, making air pollution a relatively less local issue in cleaner areas.
Arguably, non-market valuation of an issue that directly concerns respondents is
less likely subject to the possibility that respondents behave as citizens (Nyborg
2000). When behaving as citizens, respondents may reveal social preferences
instead of personal preferences due to a ‘‘warm glow’’ effect (Kling et al. 2012).
This study seeks personal preferences because interest is on individuals’ trade-offs.
No-responses to contingent valuation questions are partially driven by budget
constraints. Thus, a useful case study must refer to a population that can potentially
afford an improvement in air quality. While a few other counties in Mexico City
face at least as much air pollution as DGAM, income in these counties tends to be
smaller than in DGAM. Per capita GDP in DGAM during 2009 was around 12,900
US dollars of 2005, just 100 US dollars below the median in Mexico City (CEFP
2009). A trade-off between attitudes and concerns is more likely present in a context
where economic development has spread unequally. Since early 1990s, DGAM’s
Gini Index has been around 0.38, and 7% of people have been living under food
poverty conditions (CEFP 2009).
3.2 Descriptive statistics
Once missing values have been excluded, 1541 observations are used in statistical
analysis. Descriptive statistics refer to these observations. Table 1 presents a
consistency test by checking whether percentage of no-responses increases as bid
increases. Bids presented to respondents take a value between US $7.5 and US
$87.5 (2008 US dollars). Although not monotonically, percentage of no-responses
increases from 10.5% when bid is US $7.5 to 31.6% when bid is US $87.5.
Table 2 compares averages of socioeconomic characteristics in the sample
against DGAM values. Sample values for percentage of males, average age, number
of household members, proportion of retired people, and car at household are not
statistically different (at 95% conﬁdence) from DGAM values—0.48, 38.50, 3.70,
0.12, and 0.76, respectively. Proportion of unemployed people is larger in the

sample—0.66 versus 0.54. The proportion of households with at least one member
affected by a respiratory illness or allergy is not readily available at the county level.
Our own estimations, based on respiratory-related morbidity and/or mortality, do
not yield convincing ﬁgures and, therefore, we do not present them in Table 2.
Table 3 reports respondents’ opinions about air pollution and poverty/economic
development. Three categories—important, slightly important, and not important at
all—are grouped in one category labeled ‘‘not very important’’. Both issues are
considered very important by 57.88% of respondents; 20.51% consider poverty/
economic development a very important and air pollution a not very important issue;
3.89% consider the opposite; and 17.72% consider none of the issues very important.
Table 4 reports stated range in which monthly household income falls and
respondent’s contribution to this monthly income. Considering the tendency to
miss-report income, categorization of income provides ordinal information. That is,
categories can be seen as reﬂecting order but not magnitude. Tabulation and
small percentage of respondents from households with the highest income category
(3.31%) and the lack of respondents in this category that contribute either less than
50% or more than 75%.

4 Results
Results from logit speciﬁcations on WTP responses are reported in Table 5. The
ﬁrst column reports the analysis on the entire sample, i.e. 1541 observations. The
rest of the speciﬁcations reported in Table 5 work as robustness checks. We check
that results are robust to the exclusion of the richest and the oldest respondents
(columns two to four in Table 5) and to the presence of protest respondents (ﬁfth
column in Table 5).
Coefﬁcients in Table 5 are not interpretable as marginal effects but we discuss
their sign which points to the direction of the effect of the corresponding variable.
Focusing on the results arising from the analysis of the entire sample (ﬁrst column),
the ﬁrst set of coefﬁcients in Table 5 refers to the key variables in this study—i.e.
bid, environmental and social attitudes, and family concerns. Bid’s negative
coefﬁcient implies that a higher proportion of no is observed as the bid increases—
which is consistent with the exploratory analysis in Table 1. When focusing on the
environmental and social attitudes, we notice that while respondents that consider
air pollution a very important problem have larger WTP (which we learn from the
positive sign of 1.15), respondents that consider poverty/economic development a
very important problem have smaller WTP (which is inferred from its corresponding -1.31 coefﬁcient). Importantly, the impact on WTP remains positive when
respondent considers both problems are very important (which is implied by the
1.39 estimate).
The other set of key variables in our study refer to three family concerns—
whether a family member is sick of a respiratory illness or allergy, whether there is a
car at the household, and family size. Family size is included through two
variables—whether adults at the household are more than sample median (i.e. 2),
and whether children at household are more than sample median (i.e. 1). According
to the second set of coefﬁcients in Table 5, having a sick member increases WTP
for improved air quality. Having a car at the household does not impact the WTP. A
respondent whose household is composed by more adults than the median has
smaller WTP. Number of children at home has no impact on WTP.
The rest of the coefﬁcients have the expected sign or have no impact at all—e.g.
gender of respondent does not impact WTP, a respondent with a full-time job
reports higher WTP than a respondent with no job, older respondents tend to report
higher WTP, and richer respondents tend to report higher WTP with exception of
the richest respondents. Several possibilities are behind the negative sign associated
with the richest respondents. A ﬁrst explanation is that richer people may already be
taking precautions against air pollution and, therefore, be less willing to contribute
to a public good. For instance, if richer respondents have already bought indoor air

respondents may be intrinsically more selﬁsh.
A couple of variables have been included to test whether respondents have taken
into account their income when answering the WTP questions. Controlling for
income category allows differences in marginal utility of income across income
levels (Haab and McConnell 2002). While household income may reﬂect a
household’s budget restriction, a respondent may not be the household decision
maker. A strategy to capture a respondent budgetary constraint is interacting
categories of monthly household income with categories of respondent’s contribution to household income. Respondent’s contribution categories yield positive
coefﬁcients, which implies that a larger contribution to the household income also
increases the WTP. However, interaction effects are negative and signiﬁcant in a
couple of cases. This implies that increase in WTP is not monotonic with income
and contribution.
We do carry out three robustness checks to the presence of the richest and oldest
respondents. The robustness check to age is motivated by relatively large coefﬁcient
associated with the category of people older than 55—while variation in age barely
matters for categories below 55, the coefﬁcient for people older than 55 is 3.25. The
robustness check for income is motivated by the negative sign of the coefﬁcient
corresponding to the richest respondents (-2.039). This sign stands out because the
signs of the coefﬁcients associated for lower income categories are positive and
signiﬁcant. While a negative sign is feasible even if air quality is a normal good,5
we explore whether the exclusion of such respondents change the main message of
the initial speciﬁcation.
Results reported in columns two to four refer to speciﬁcations that work as
robustness checks to age and income. The second column reports results from a
speciﬁcation that excludes the observations in the highest income category—51
observations. The third column refers to a speciﬁcation excluding respondents older
than 55—298 observations. The fourth column reports results from a speciﬁcation
excluding observations in the highest income and age categories. These three
speciﬁcations deliver results that are qualitatively similar to those obtained by
analyzing the entire sample—i.e. signs remain identical and magnitudes of the
coefﬁcients are similar when excluding the richest, the oldest or both. Thus, we
conclude that results are not driven by inclusion or exclusion of age and income
categories.
An additional robustness check is carried out with respect to the presence of
protest respondents. Protest response is an empirical staple of the contingent
valuation literature (see Strazzera et al. 2003; Chen and Hua 2015). The term refers
to the respondents that report zero WTP due to non-budget related reasons. That is, a
respondent stating that his/her budget is not enough to pay for cleaner air quality is
5

For instance, in the literature valuing the presence of urban and peri-urban trees and forests, some
studies have reported a positive income elasticity, other studies have yielded no signiﬁcant effect from
income, with a few studies even reporting negative income elasticities (see Brander and Koetse 2011). A
negative income elasticity is a reasonable result because, in our context, it is possible that beyond certain
income level people may prefer to purchase cleaner air in a private market in the form of large gardens at
respondents that express distrust or complaint about the WTP survey in itself. In this
study, protest respondents believe that they should not pay because (1) clean air is a
right; (2) the scenario is not believable or practical; (3) the program should be
ﬁnanced by the polluters; and (4) the government administrators are not able to
solve the problem of air pollution.
We check whether results are driven by the presence of protest respondents. The
ﬁfth speciﬁcation in Table 5 reports results from analyzing a sample that excludes
protest respondents. In general, results are qualitatively similar to those obtained
when analyzing the entire sample. The coefﬁcient that deserves the most attention is
the one capturing the impacts from the bid. Signiﬁcant differences in the estimation
of the bid coefﬁcient directly impact the point estimates of the WTP because
_

_

EðWTPÞ ¼ Xb= À c, where X includes a vector of ones and the explanatory
_

variables of the empirical speciﬁcations, and b is the vector of corresponding
_
estimated coefﬁcients and c is the estimated coefﬁcient for bid.6 In this study, the
point estimate of the bid coefﬁcient on the entire sample is -0.0024; and the bid
coefﬁcient on the sample excluding protest respondents is -0.0019. These point
estimates, however, are not statistically different—the 95% conﬁdence interval from
the trimmed sample (-0.0025 to -0.0013) includes the -0.0024 obtained on the
entire sample. Putting together the fact that results do not differ qualitatively and
that the bid coefﬁcient is not statistically different when excluding protest
respondents, we conclude that results are robust to the presence of protest
respondents.
Results, in WTP terms, from analyzing the entire sample are graphically
illustrated in Fig. 1. This ﬁgure depicts WTP for improved air quality for different
respondents’ proﬁles. Environmental and social attitudes, and family concerns are
varied with respect to a baseline proﬁle. This proﬁle corresponds to a respondent
with a full-time job, between 45 and 55 years of age, with household income
between US $967 and US $2167 to which he/she contributes more than 75%. This
respondent has an average WTP of US $262. The dashed line in the middle in Fig. 1
shows the variation in WTP when environmental and social attitudes are taken into
account. If respondent considers air pollution a very important problem, WTP
increases to US $302. In contrast, WTP decreases to US $222 if respondent
considers that poverty/economic development is a very important problem. WTP is
US $ 311 if respondent considers both problems very important.
Respondents have higher WTP if a family member suffers a respiratory illness or
allergy. This holds regardless of environmental and social attitudes. As illustrated
by the straight line in Fig. 1, WTP increases by around 12% when a family member
is sick. It is still the case that, among respondents with a sick family member, the
respondent considering poverty a very important problem is the one with the lowest
WTP (US $255). This respondent has lower WTP than respondents considering
poverty is not a very important problem and with no sick family member—US
$262, US $302, and US $311, as illustrated by the line in the middle in Fig. 1. This

concerns. Baseline refers to a respondent with a full-time job, between 45 and 55 years of age, with
household income between US $967 and US $2167 to which he/she contributes more than 75%

last result implies that considering poverty/economic development a very important
has a stronger negative impact in WTP than having a sick family member.
Respondents have lower WTP if they are living in a household with more adults
than the sample median. This holds regardless of environmental and social attitudes.
As illustrated by dashed line at the bottom of Fig. 1, WTP decreases by around 22%
when there are more adults in the household than the sample median.
WTP illustrated in Fig. 1 and their corresponding 90% empirical conﬁdence
intervals are reported in Table 6. Conﬁdence intervals are obtained from 10,000
Krinsky–Robb repetitions (Krinsky and Robb 1986). Conventional statistical
comparison of means is not appropriate in this context because average WTP and
their corresponding distributions are correlated. In this context, non-parametric,
multivariate comparisons of distributions are the correct tool (see Poe et al.
1994, 1997). These comparison are, however, non-essential to extract lessons from
our results: environmental and social attitudes, and family concerns induce tradeoffs in WTP.

5 Conclusions and discussion
Estimated annual average WTP to improve air quality in MCMA is US $ 262 (2008
US dollars). Taking into consideration the 90% conﬁdence interval (US $194–US
$336), this value is not statistically different from comparable average values
reported in previous studies. Hanna and Oliva (2015) estimate gains in labor
productivity of US $247 per worker annually if a policy is implemented to reach
pollution levels with similar impacts than those described in the contingent

Also, Martınez-Cruz and Sainz-Santamarıa (2015) report US $223 as the average
annual WTP of a person to visit a peri-urban natural park near Mexico City
(Desierto de los Leones). Arguably, given the peri-urban nature, visits to the
Desierto de los Leones Park is at least partially motivated by the need for cleaner
´
´
air. That is, the WTP of US$ 223 reported by Martınez-Cruz and Sainz-Santamarıa
(2015) can be interpreted as an upper bound of the WTP for cleaner air among the
population sampled in their study—which is composed by people mostly visiting
from the MCMA. Taking into consideration the 90% conﬁdence interval of the
average WTP reported in this study, our estimates are not statistically different from
´
´
those reported by Martınez-Cruz and Sainz-Santamarıa (2015).
Previous studies reporting estimates of WTP to improve air quality in MCMA
include those inferring avoided costs of illness (Bell et al. 2006; McKinley et al.
2005; Cesar et al. 2002; Margulis 1996); those inferring values of a statistical life
´
(Hammit and Ibarraran 2006); and those estimating hedonic price functions
´guez-Sanchez 2014; Gonzalez et al. 2013). Their WTP estimates are,
´
(Rodrı
however, not comparable to estimates presented in this paper because the good
under valuation is not similar. Speciﬁcally, while hedonic prices measure marginal
changes in housing prices due to marginal changes in air quality, our contingent
valuation exercise refers to a non-marginal change in air quality. For the case of
avoided cost of illness, WTP estimates usually refer to aggregate savings from
avoided medical expenses given unclear changes in air quality.
In contrast to previous application in the Mexican context, this paper yields WTP
estimates differentiated by environmental and social attitudes, and family concerns.
Respondents considering air pollution a very important problem have higher WTP
than average (US $302). Respondents considering poverty/economic development a
very important problem have smaller WTP than average (US $222). Respondents
sample median (i.e. 2) have a lower WTP than average (US $214).
From a public policy perspective, differentiated estimates of WTP are useful in
carrying out cost–beneﬁt analysis of environmental policies under different sets of
assumptions. For instance, assume authorities only considered citizens with the
highest WTP (US $344). Individuals with the highest WTP have a sick family
member, have a full-time job, are between 45 and 55 years of age, and have
household income between US $967 and US $2167 to which they contribute more
than 75%. These individuals represent 1% of the sample under analysis. Assume
this proportion holds for the entire MCMA. Assume 10 million adults in the
MCMA.7 Thus 100 thousand individuals would be each willing to pay US $344
annually. Their contributions would amount to US $34.4 million annually. These
resources would be enough to invest in hybrid buses, a project requiring US $30
million annually according to McKinley et al. (2005).
A limitation in this study is that WTP estimates are based on a sample arguably
representative of a county in MCMA. Several assumptions must be made to
extrapolate WTP estimates to the entire population in MCMA. Considering that
average WTP is in the range reported in previous studies using different approaches
and populations, we believe this limitation is relatively minor. Of course, an
extrapolation exercise must be careful in using ofﬁcial and most recent numbers
available.
Results from this paper can be linked to the literature on micro-foundations of the
Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC). This literature hast yet to provide convincing
evidence on whether people trade economic development and environmental quality
(see Barbier et al. 2015). A major challenge in this literature is estimation of income
elasticity of demand for environmental quality and establishing an unambiguous
link between this elasticity and the EKC. This paper gets around estimation of
elasticity of demand for environmental quality and instead gathers data reﬂecting
individuals’ opinions with respect to economic development and environmental
priorities, and uses these opinions in the WTP speciﬁcations. With estimates of
utility parameters at hand, variations in WTP are inferred for groups of individuals
differing in their opinions with respect to economic development and environmental
quality. In this way, this paper ﬁnds evidence suggesting individuals trade
environmental improvements for economic development when stating their WTP
for cleaner air.

Abstract By means of a single-bounded, referendum format contingent valuation,
this paper estimates willingness to pay (WTP) for improved air quality among
residents of Mexico City Metropolitan Area (MCMA). Findings from this paper
illustrate heterogeneity in WTP associated with environmental and social attitudes,
and family concerns. For instance, WTP is higher than average if respondents state a
very high priority to air pollution but smaller than average if respondent’s household
contains more adults than the sample median. This contingent valuation exercise
provides elements to carry out cost–beneﬁt analysis of environmental policies both
recently implemented and currently under discussion in the MCMA context. For
instance, a cost–beneﬁt analysis using estimates from this paper suggests beneﬁts
from improved air quality surpass the costs of investing in hybrid buses. Usefulness
of this study is underscored by pointing out recent evidence suggesting that (1) air
pollution in MCMA has larger health impacts than in similar cities located in
developed countries, and (2) policies tackling air pollution in MCMA have had no
impact on pollution levels.

¨
Air pollution remains a pressing issue in megacities located in developing countries.
Mexico City Metropolitan Area (MCMA) is an infamous case. Pollution levels in
MCMA regularly surpass limits suggested by the World Health Organization (CAI
2013). Also, MCMA has been ranked as the second most congested city in the world
during 2014.1 Effects of air pollution on the respiratory system have long been
˜
documented in MCMA (e.g. Escamilla-Nunez et al. 2008; Romieu et al. 2008).
Recent epidemiological studies report neuro-inﬂammation in otherwise healthy
´
˜
children residing in MCMA (Calderon-Garciduenas et al. 2008). In general, air
pollution produces larger health impacts in Mexico city than in similar cities located
in a developed country (Arceo-Gomez et al. 2012).
Public policies aiming to reduce air pollution have proved unsuccessful in
MCMA. Launched in 1989, Hoy No Circula (HNC) program represents the most
important governmental effort aiming to reduce pollution levels in MCMA.2 HNC
limits the number of weekdays a car is driven in Mexico City. HNC tackles the use
of cars because it is the largest contributor to air pollution in MCMA—45% of
volatile organic compounds and 81% of total nitrogen oxides (Molina and Molina
2002). Empirical studies have reported no impact from HNC on air pollution levels
and an undesirable positive impact on numbers of cars driven (Gallego et al.
2013a, b; Davis 2008). Authorities frequently implement a pre-contingency plan
that imposes temporary driving restrictions.3 The most recent attempt to improve air
quality, consisting in extending HNC to Saturdays, has been launched in July 2014.
A question arises in this context—what is the WTP of a resident of MCMA for
improved air quality? This paper elicits WTP for improved air quality by means of a
single-bounded, referendum format contingent valuation question. Respondents state
their willingness to monetarily contribute to improve air levels from observed regular
quality to good quality. This paper pays particular attention to differences in WTP
´
explained by individuals attitudes and concerns in three realms—environmental, social,
´
and family. The economic literature has already established the relevance of individuals
attitudes and concerns as factors behind variability in WTP (e.g. Bartczak 2015;
´
˜
Martınez-Espineira and Lyssenko 2011; Spash 2006; Spash et al. 2009). This paper
illustrates this relevance in the Mexican context. To measure attitudes, respondents are
asked to state their opinion on how important is the air pollution problem and the
poverty/economic development problem. To measure concerns, respondents are asked
to report (1) whether a family member (including himself) suffers an allergy or a
respiratory illness; (2) whether there is a car at the household; and (3) family size.
Average WTP in this paper—US $262 (2008 US dollars)—falls close to comparable
estimates reported in previous studies. For instance, Hanna and Oliva (2015) report US

WTP associated with environmental and social attitudes, and family concerns. For
instance, while respondents posing a very high priority to the air pollution problem have
higher than average WTP (US $302), respondents in a household with more adults than
the sample median (i.e. 2) have a lower than average WTP (US $214). While
respondents posing a very high priority to the poverty/economic development problem
have smaller than average WTP (US $222), respondents with a family member suffering
allergies or respiratory illness have higher than average WTP (US $295). Indeed, this
contingent valuation exercise provides elements to carry out cost–beneﬁt analysis of
policies aiming to improve air quality in MCMA—e.g. expansion of metro system,
maintenance or replacement of sources of liquid petroleum gas leaks, taxi renovation,
´
and use of hybrid buses (see Garcıa-Robles 2010; McKinley et al. 2005). Instances of
cost–beneﬁt analysis based on these estimates are presented in the discussion section.

2 Valuation methodology
Data are gathered through a contingent evaluation elicitation. Contingent evaluation
elicitations have widely been used in countries facing air quality problems—e.g.
Taiwan (Alberini et al. 1997), China (Wang and Zhang 2009), and Sweden
(Carlsson and Johansson-Stenman 2000). A single-bounded, referendum format
elicitation has been implemented in this study. This type of elicitation describes a
hypothetical market as a referendum in which respondents are asked whether they
would vote for or against a project in a public vote (Kling et al. 2012). Advantages
of this type of question include theoretical incentive compatibility, conceptual
simplicity, and similarity to a real-life decision mechanism. Single-bounded
questions, however, do not yield the most statistically efﬁcient WTP estimates.
Increase in statistical efﬁciency is obtained through double-bounded (Hanemann
et al. 1991) and one-and-one-half-bounded (Cooper et al. 2002) approaches. These
alternatives share several inconveniences with the single-bounded approach—warm
glow effect, anchoring, sensitivity to scope, and hypothetical bias (Carson 2012;
Carson et al. 2001; Bateman et al. 2009). In addition, one-and-half-bounded
approach may be non-incentive compatible (Bateman et al. 2009).
Both conceptual simplicity and similarity to a real-life decision mechanism have
driven the selection of single-bounded approach in this study. Both features
facilitate administration and execution, particularly in developing countries where
contingent valuation applications are still uncommon.4 Administration and

While Mexico is an OECD member, this paper follows recommendations targeting developing countries
because contingent valuation studies in Mexico are still rare. A non-exhaustive search yielded 15 published
studies in which Mexican respondents stated WTP through a contingent valuation question or a discrete
´
choice experiment. Papers focused on water-related issues include Almendarez-Hernandez et al. (2013),
´
´
´
˜
˜
Aviles-Polanco et al. (2010); Perez-Verdin et al. (2011); Rivera-Planter and Munoz-Pina (2005), Sanchez´
Brito et al. (2013), Soto-Montes de Oca et al. (2006), and Vasquez et al. (2009). A few studies have
researched preferences of farmers with respect to natural resources (Birol et al. 2009; Scarpa et al. 2003).
Additional topics cover valuation of food safety (Tonsor et al. 2009), smoking cessation treatment (HerediaPi et al. 2012), cross-border health insurance (Vargas-Bustamante et al. 2008), environmentally certiﬁed
´
valuation instrument (Whittington 2002). Conceptual simplicity and comparability
to a real-life situation eases explanation and understanding for both enumerators and
respondents. A single-bounded approach is also less time-consuming which
increases the response rate.
The elicitation protocol used in this paper ﬁrst elicits respondents’ attitudes.
Respondents were asked to rank how important are air pollution and poverty/
economic development problems to Mexico. Respondents separately ranked the
level of importance by choosing one of four categories—very important, important,
slightly important, and not important at all.
Then a summary of air pollution effects on human health is presented.
Respondents are explained how air pollution is measured in Mexico and informed
about air pollution levels in Mexico City during a normal year.
Then a strategy to improve air quality is described. This strategy would introduce
ﬁlters to the exhaust systems of cars and industry. In addition, a limit would be
imposed to the sulfur in fossil fuels of residential and industrial use. This strategy
would bring pollutants’ concentrations down from observed regular quality levels to
good quality levels. This change in air quality would save around 2200 lives and
avoid 37,000 hospital admissions yearly.
The protocol explains the government is considering putting this plan to a vote.
Respondents are informed that they would partially cover costs of implementing this
policy. The phrasing of the elicitation question is as follows: taking into
consideration that the strategy described above will increase your annual expenses
by ____, would you be willing to support this strategy if the government put it to a
vote?
Socioeconomic characteristics and family concerns are gathered in the last
section of the protocol. Respondents report whether someone in his/her family
(including his/herself) suffers from allergies or a respiratory illness. Respondents
also report whether a car is owned by someone in the family. Owning a car is
considered a family concern because, in order to comply with HNC requirements,
owners must face annual expenses and transactional costs—sometimes involving a
bribe to personnel in charge of car’s inspections (Oliva, 2012). The number of
household members is also a family concern. The respondent is asked for the
number of adults and children at home.

3 Data
3.1 Collection
Data were gathered from mid-December 2007 to mid-January 2008. A random
sample of 1812 individuals was approached in public places—e.g. malls, parks, and
´
small businesses—located in Delegacion Gustavo A. Madero (DGAM), a county in
Mexico City. Two features make DGAM an insightful case for the purposes of this
study: air pollution levels and relative economic development. That is, DGAM
where unequal economic development is expected to yield a trade-off between
environmental and social attitudes, and family concerns.
DGAM consistently ranks among the most polluted counties of MCMA since
early 1990s (SMAGDF 2009; Proaire 2001;). This feature makes air pollution a
local environmental issue for inhabitants of DGAM. Although Mexico city as a
whole struggles with air pollution, pollution levels in the south of Mexico City are
regularly lower, making air pollution a relatively less local issue in cleaner areas.
Arguably, non-market valuation of an issue that directly concerns respondents is
less likely subject to the possibility that respondents behave as citizens (Nyborg
2000). When behaving as citizens, respondents may reveal social preferences
instead of personal preferences due to a ‘‘warm glow’’ effect (Kling et al. 2012).
This study seeks personal preferences because interest is on individuals’ trade-offs.
No-responses to contingent valuation questions are partially driven by budget
constraints. Thus, a useful case study must refer to a population that can potentially
afford an improvement in air quality. While a few other counties in Mexico City
face at least as much air pollution as DGAM, income in these counties tends to be
smaller than in DGAM. Per capita GDP in DGAM during 2009 was around 12,900
US dollars of 2005, just 100 US dollars below the median in Mexico City (CEFP
2009). A trade-off between attitudes and concerns is more likely present in a context
where economic development has spread unequally. Since early 1990s, DGAM’s
Gini Index has been around 0.38, and 7% of people have been living under food
poverty conditions (CEFP 2009).
3.2 Descriptive statistics
Once missing values have been excluded, 1541 observations are used in statistical
analysis. Descriptive statistics refer to these observations. Table 1 presents a
consistency test by checking whether percentage of no-responses increases as bid
increases. Bids presented to respondents take a value between US $7.5 and US
$87.5 (2008 US dollars). Although not monotonically, percentage of no-responses
increases from 10.5% when bid is US $7.5 to 31.6% when bid is US $87.5.
Table 2 compares averages of socioeconomic characteristics in the sample
against DGAM values. Sample values for percentage of males, average age, number
of household members, proportion of retired people, and car at household are not
statistically different (at 95% conﬁdence) from DGAM values—0.48, 38.50, 3.70,
0.12, and 0.76, respectively. Proportion of unemployed people is larger in the

Our own estimations, based on respiratory-related morbidity and/or mortality, do
not yield convincing ﬁgures and, therefore, we do not present them in Table 2.
Table 3 reports respondents’ opinions about air pollution and poverty/economic
development. Three categories—important, slightly important, and not important at
all—are grouped in one category labeled ‘‘not very important’’. Both issues are
considered very important by 57.88% of respondents; 20.51% consider poverty/
economic development a very important and air pollution a not very important issue;
3.89% consider the opposite; and 17.72% consider none of the issues very important.
Table 4 reports stated range in which monthly household income falls and
respondent’s contribution to this monthly income. Considering the tendency to
miss-report income, categorization of income provides ordinal information. That is,
categories can be seen as reﬂecting order but not magnitude. Tabulation and
small percentage of respondents from households with the highest income category
(3.31%) and the lack of respondents in this category that contribute either less than
50% or more than 75%.

4 Results
Results from logit speciﬁcations on WTP responses are reported in Table 5. The
ﬁrst column reports the analysis on the entire sample, i.e. 1541 observations. The
rest of the speciﬁcations reported in Table 5 work as robustness checks. We check
that results are robust to the exclusion of the richest and the oldest respondents
(columns two to four in Table 5) and to the presence of protest respondents (ﬁfth
column in Table 5).
Coefﬁcients in Table 5 are not interpretable as marginal effects but we discuss
their sign which points to the direction of the effect of the corresponding variable.
Focusing on the results arising from the analysis of the entire sample (ﬁrst column),
the ﬁrst set of coefﬁcients in Table 5 refers to the key variables in this study—i.e.
bid, environmental and social attitudes, and family concerns. Bid’s negative
coefﬁcient implies that a higher proportion of no is observed as the bid increases—
which is consistent with the exploratory analysis in Table 1. When focusing on the
environmental and social attitudes, we notice that while respondents that consider
air pollution a very important problem have larger WTP (which we learn from the
positive sign of 1.15), respondents that consider poverty/economic development a
very important problem have smaller WTP (which is inferred from its corresponding -1.31 coefﬁcient). Importantly, the impact on WTP remains positive when
respondent considers both problems are very important (which is implied by the
1.39 estimate).
The other set of key variables in our study refer to three family concerns—
whether a family member is sick of a respiratory illness or allergy, whether there is a
car at the household, and family size. Family size is included through two
variables—whether adults at the household are more than sample median (i.e. 2),
and whether children at household are more than sample median (i.e. 1). According
to the second set of coefﬁcients in Table 5, having a sick member increases WTP
for improved air quality. Having a car at the household does not impact the WTP. A
respondent whose household is composed by more adults than the median has
smaller WTP. Number of children at home has no impact on WTP.
The rest of the coefﬁcients have the expected sign or have no impact at all—e.g.
gender of respondent does not impact WTP, a respondent with a full-time job
reports higher WTP than a respondent with no job, older respondents tend to report
higher WTP, and richer respondents tend to report higher WTP with exception of
the richest respondents. Several possibilities are behind the negative sign associated
with the richest respondents. A ﬁrst explanation is that richer people may already be
taking precautions against air pollution and, therefore, be less willing to contribute
to a public good. For instance, if richer respondents have already bought indoor air

respondents may be intrinsically more selﬁsh.
A couple of variables have been included to test whether respondents have taken
into account their income when answering the WTP questions. Controlling for
income category allows differences in marginal utility of income across income
levels (Haab and McConnell 2002). While household income may reﬂect a
household’s budget restriction, a respondent may not be the household decision
maker. A strategy to capture a respondent budgetary constraint is interacting
categories of monthly household income with categories of respondent’s contribution to household income. Respondent’s contribution categories yield positive
coefﬁcients, which implies that a larger contribution to the household income also
increases the WTP. However, interaction effects are negative and signiﬁcant in a
couple of cases. This implies that increase in WTP is not monotonic with income
and contribution.
We do carry out three robustness checks to the presence of the richest and oldest
respondents. The robustness check to age is motivated by relatively large coefﬁcient
associated with the category of people older than 55—while variation in age barely
matters for categories below 55, the coefﬁcient for people older than 55 is 3.25. The
robustness check for income is motivated by the negative sign of the coefﬁcient
corresponding to the richest respondents (-2.039). This sign stands out because the
signs of the coefﬁcients associated for lower income categories are positive and
signiﬁcant. While a negative sign is feasible even if air quality is a normal good,5
we explore whether the exclusion of such respondents change the main message of
the initial speciﬁcation.
Results reported in columns two to four refer to speciﬁcations that work as
robustness checks to age and income. The second column reports results from a
speciﬁcation that excludes the observations in the highest income category—51
observations. The third column refers to a speciﬁcation excluding respondents older
than 55—298 observations. The fourth column reports results from a speciﬁcation
excluding observations in the highest income and age categories. These three
speciﬁcations deliver results that are qualitatively similar to those obtained by
analyzing the entire sample—i.e. signs remain identical and magnitudes of the
coefﬁcients are similar when excluding the richest, the oldest or both. Thus, we
conclude that results are not driven by inclusion or exclusion of age and income
categories.
An additional robustness check is carried out with respect to the presence of
protest respondents. Protest response is an empirical staple of the contingent
valuation literature (see Strazzera et al. 2003; Chen and Hua 2015). The term refers
to the respondents that report zero WTP due to non-budget related reasons. That is, a
respondent stating that his/her budget is not enough to pay for cleaner air quality is
5

For instance, in the literature valuing the presence of urban and peri-urban trees and forests, some
studies have reported a positive income elasticity, other studies have yielded no signiﬁcant effect from
income, with a few studies even reporting negative income elasticities (see Brander and Koetse 2011). A
negative income elasticity is a reasonable result because, in our context, it is possible that beyond certain
income level people may prefer to purchase cleaner air in a private market in the form of large gardens at
respondents that express distrust or complaint about the WTP survey in itself. In this
study, protest respondents believe that they should not pay because (1) clean air is a
right; (2) the scenario is not believable or practical; (3) the program should be
ﬁnanced by the polluters; and (4) the government administrators are not able to
solve the problem of air pollution.
We check whether results are driven by the presence of protest respondents. The
ﬁfth speciﬁcation in Table 5 reports results from analyzing a sample that excludes
protest respondents. In general, results are qualitatively similar to those obtained
when analyzing the entire sample. The coefﬁcient that deserves the most attention is
the one capturing the impacts from the bid. Signiﬁcant differences in the estimation
of the bid coefﬁcient directly impact the point estimates of the WTP because
_

_

EðWTPÞ ¼ Xb= À c, where X includes a vector of ones and the explanatory
_

variables of the empirical speciﬁcations, and b is the vector of corresponding
_
estimated coefﬁcients and c is the estimated coefﬁcient for bid.6 In this study, the
point estimate of the bid coefﬁcient on the entire sample is -0.0024; and the bid
coefﬁcient on the sample excluding protest respondents is -0.0019. These point
estimates, however, are not statistically different—the 95% conﬁdence interval from
the trimmed sample (-0.0025 to -0.0013) includes the -0.0024 obtained on the
entire sample. Putting together the fact that results do not differ qualitatively and
that the bid coefﬁcient is not statistically different when excluding protest
respondents, we conclude that results are robust to the presence of protest
respondents.
Results, in WTP terms, from analyzing the entire sample are graphically
illustrated in Fig. 1. This ﬁgure depicts WTP for improved air quality for different
respondents’ proﬁles. Environmental and social attitudes, and family concerns are
varied with respect to a baseline proﬁle. This proﬁle corresponds to a respondent
with a full-time job, between 45 and 55 years of age, with household income
between US $967 and US $2167 to which he/she contributes more than 75%. This
respondent has an average WTP of US $262. The dashed line in the middle in Fig. 1
shows the variation in WTP when environmental and social attitudes are taken into
account. If respondent considers air pollution a very important problem, WTP
increases to US $302. In contrast, WTP decreases to US $222 if respondent
considers that poverty/economic development is a very important problem. WTP is
US $ 311 if respondent considers both problems very important.
Respondents have higher WTP if a family member suffers a respiratory illness or
allergy. This holds regardless of environmental and social attitudes. As illustrated
by the straight line in Fig. 1, WTP increases by around 12% when a family member
is sick. It is still the case that, among respondents with a sick family member, the
respondent considering poverty a very important problem is the one with the lowest
WTP (US $255). This respondent has lower WTP than respondents considering
poverty is not a very important problem and with no sick family member—US
$262, US $302, and US $311, as illustrated by the line in the middle in Fig. 1. This

concerns. Baseline refers to a respondent with a full-time job, between 45 and 55 years of age, with
household income between US $967 and US $2167 to which he/she contributes more than 75%

last result implies that considering poverty/economic development a very important
has a stronger negative impact in WTP than having a sick family member.
Respondents have lower WTP if they are living in a household with more adults
than the sample median. This holds regardless of environmental and social attitudes.
As illustrated by dashed line at the bottom of Fig. 1, WTP decreases by around 22%
when there are more adults in the household than the sample median.
WTP illustrated in Fig. 1 and their corresponding 90% empirical conﬁdence
intervals are reported in Table 6. Conﬁdence intervals are obtained from 10,000
Krinsky–Robb repetitions (Krinsky and Robb 1986). Conventional statistical
comparison of means is not appropriate in this context because average WTP and
their corresponding distributions are correlated. In this context, non-parametric,
multivariate comparisons of distributions are the correct tool (see Poe et al.
1994, 1997). These comparison are, however, non-essential to extract lessons from
our results: environmental and social attitudes, and family concerns induce tradeoffs in WTP.

5 Conclusions and discussion
Estimated annual average WTP to improve air quality in MCMA is US $ 262 (2008
US dollars). Taking into consideration the 90% conﬁdence interval (US $194–US
$336), this value is not statistically different from comparable average values
reported in previous studies. Hanna and Oliva (2015) estimate gains in labor
productivity of US $247 per worker annually if a policy is implemented to reach
pollution levels with similar impacts than those described in the contingent

Also, Martınez-Cruz and Sainz-Santamarıa (2015) report US $223 as the average
annual WTP of a person to visit a peri-urban natural park near Mexico City
(Desierto de los Leones). Arguably, given the peri-urban nature, visits to the
Desierto de los Leones Park is at least partially motivated by the need for cleaner
´
´
air. That is, the WTP of US$ 223 reported by Martınez-Cruz and Sainz-Santamarıa
(2015) can be interpreted as an upper bound of the WTP for cleaner air among the
population sampled in their study—which is composed by people mostly visiting
from the MCMA. Taking into consideration the 90% conﬁdence interval of the
average WTP reported in this study, our estimates are not statistically different from
´
´
those reported by Martınez-Cruz and Sainz-Santamarıa (2015).
Previous studies reporting estimates of WTP to improve air quality in MCMA
include those inferring avoided costs of illness (Bell et al. 2006; McKinley et al.
2005; Cesar et al. 2002; Margulis 1996); those inferring values of a statistical life
´
(Hammit and Ibarraran 2006); and those estimating hedonic price functions
´guez-Sanchez 2014; Gonzalez et al. 2013). Their WTP estimates are,
´
(Rodrı
however, not comparable to estimates presented in this paper because the good
under valuation is not similar. Speciﬁcally, while hedonic prices measure marginal
changes in housing prices due to marginal changes in air quality, our contingent
valuation exercise refers to a non-marginal change in air quality. For the case of
avoided cost of illness, WTP estimates usually refer to aggregate savings from
avoided medical expenses given unclear changes in air quality.
In contrast to previous application in the Mexican context, this paper yields WTP
estimates differentiated by environmental and social attitudes, and family concerns.
Respondents considering air pollution a very important problem have higher WTP
than average (US $302). Respondents considering poverty/economic development a
very important problem have smaller WTP than average (US $222). Respondents
sample median (i.e. 2) have a lower WTP than average (US $214).
From a public policy perspective, differentiated estimates of WTP are useful in
carrying out cost–beneﬁt analysis of environmental policies under different sets of
assumptions. For instance, assume authorities only considered citizens with the
highest WTP (US $344). Individuals with the highest WTP have a sick family
member, have a full-time job, are between 45 and 55 years of age, and have
household income between US $967 and US $2167 to which they contribute more
than 75%. These individuals represent 1% of the sample under analysis. Assume
this proportion holds for the entire MCMA. Assume 10 million adults in the
MCMA.7 Thus 100 thousand individuals would be each willing to pay US $344
annually. Their contributions would amount to US $34.4 million annually. These
resources would be enough to invest in hybrid buses, a project requiring US $30
million annually according to McKinley et al. (2005).
A limitation in this study is that WTP estimates are based on a sample arguably
representative of a county in MCMA. Several assumptions must be made to
extrapolate WTP estimates to the entire population in MCMA. Considering that
average WTP is in the range reported in previous studies using different approaches
and populations, we believe this limitation is relatively minor. Of course, an
extrapolation exercise must be careful in using ofﬁcial and most recent numbers
available.
Results from this paper can be linked to the literature on micro-foundations of the
Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC). This literature hast yet to provide convincing
evidence on whether people trade economic development and environmental quality
(see Barbier et al. 2015). A major challenge in this literature is estimation of income
elasticity of demand for environmental quality and establishing an unambiguous
link between this elasticity and the EKC. This paper gets around estimation of
elasticity of demand for environmental quality and instead gathers data reﬂecting
individuals’ opinions with respect to economic development and environmental
priorities, and uses these opinions in the WTP speciﬁcations. With estimates of
utility parameters at hand, variations in WTP are inferred for groups of individuals
differing in their opinions with respect to economic development and environmental
quality. In this way, this paper ﬁnds evidence suggesting individuals trade
environmental improvements for economic development when stating their WTP
for cleaner air.
