1 Introduction
Due to the technological enhancement of additive manufacturing (AM) over the past years, AM starts to replace
subtractive production technologies. In some ﬁelds of use,
AM is competitive, because it reduces production costs and
at the same time improves the range of features of components. But if one production technology is replaced by
another, this can change production and logistics processes
as well. Still it appears that the focus in research is on
improving the actual AM production technology, although
industry and academia are aware of possible broader
implications of AM, e.g. on supply networks. Potential
implications of AM on supply networks are discussed.
Tuck et al. [17], Fawcett and Waller [8], Cottrill [6],
Christopher and Ryals [5] and Waller and Fawcett [18]
study and evaluate implications of AM, but they are of a
qualitative nature. We are not aware of study that measures
impacts of AM on supply networks and quantiﬁes these
effects. Only a few quantitative assessments like a case


study of Khajavi et al. [13] on a spare parts supply chain in
the aeronautics industry are available, which, however,
focuses on accounting issues. Quantifying the impact of
AM on supply networks appears to be important in order to
support managerial decisions on the structure of the future
supply network.
The contribution of this study is as follows: We
quantify the effects of AM on a two-stage supply network.
Raw material is transported from sources (e.g. a port) to
production sites and then to customer locations. We
model this problem as a well-known multi-stage facility
location problem. A data set of 700 instances is generated
that covers a broad range of geographical distributions of
the nodes in the network. The effect of AM is integrated
by using different buy-to-ﬂy ratios, which represent the
efﬁciency of material usage in a production process. By
comparing less efﬁcient buy-to-ﬂy ratios (i.e. traditional
production) with more efﬁcient ratios (i.e. AM), we can
compare different optimal network conﬁgurations. This is
done for each of the 700 instances. Four indicators measure the performance of the generated networks. In contrast to our previous study [3], the evaluation is
signiﬁcantly extended: instead of six instances, a set of
700 instances is generated and used for testing. We
included several more structures in these instances, in
particular with respect to the geographical distribution of
nodes as well as a different clustering of nodes. In our
previous study, the geographical distribution of the nodes
was roughly based on the network structures in Germany
and USA. In this contribution, the geographical distribution of the different nodes is created more abstractly (i.e.
not based on any country’s supply structure) and more
systematically. Therefore, broader and validated statements are possible.
This article is structured in ﬁve sections. After this
introduction, Sect. 2 will give a brief overview of AM and
describe technological aspects which probably will have
implications on the structure of supply networks. Section 3
introduces our two-stage supply network together with a
facility location-allocation model. In particular, the generation of the used data set is described. In Sect. 4, we
present and analyse the results of a computational study.
Section 5 concludes the paper.



2.1 Deﬁnition of additive manufacturing
Within the scientiﬁc community, there is a set of several
synonyms for AM and the technology, respectively. Nevertheless, AM is the most often used term. It is an umbrella
term for many different technologies. AM usually is divided into subcategories dependent for what the AM technology is used for. These subcategories are rapid
manufacturing for producing serial parts, rapid prototyping
for producing prototypes and models, and rapid tooling for
production tools for production like moulds. However, in
the non-scientiﬁc community AM is a rather unknown
term. The most common mainstream term is 3D printing
[21]. Therefore, 3D printing is the more often used term
overall. According to the mainstream term parts are printed
using ink (being equivalent to AM production using raw
material).
Regardless of the many different synonyms in the scientiﬁc and non-scientiﬁc community, there is no overallagreed deﬁnition on AM, respectively, on 3D printing until
now. In this contribution, we follow Gebhardts deﬁnition,
wherein AM is ‘‘...a layer-based automated fabrication
process for making scaled 3-dimensional physical objects
directly from 3D-CAD data without using part-depending
tools’’ [9].
The industrial development and research on AM started
mid of the twentieth century [4]. But AM is not a new
technology in general or was invented at that time. A ﬁrst
patent which could be considered AM at least partly
reaches back to 1903 [16]. In the past, the technology was
especially used for producing models or prototypes. In this
case, it is referred to as rapid prototyping. With the ongoing
development of AM, the technology is capable of printing
ﬁnal products today. Therefore, classical production technologies could be replaced by AM [6].
Currently, companies as well as research institutions
work hard on the further development of the technology
itself and set up new business models using AM for production. The most popular branches for using AM are the
aerospace industry and the medical engineering. For
example, there is research going on to replace parts like
brackets or engine sensors of an air plane, and dental
implants [1, 9, 10].
2.2 Functional integration

2 Implications of additive manufacturing
The concept of AM is introduced. Section 2.1 explains the
term AM. Among the advantages of AM discussed in the
literature, two will be explained in detail, that is, functional
integration of parts in Sect. 2.2 and a higher resource
efﬁciency for production in Sect. 2.3.

123

When using classical production technologies, usually
several production steps have to be performed and several
precursors have to be assembled to get the ﬁnal product.
Because of that the production planning becomes more
complex. But with AM this is going to change. AM enables
may be produced in a single production step [11]. An
assembly of precursors is not necessary. Therefore, the
number of production steps decreases and production
planning will be simpliﬁed.
This functional integration has not to be limited to a
single company. Imagine original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) printing the ﬁnal product in one production
step. Precursors that were originally produced by a supplier
are directly integrated in the AM process. Therefore, actors
could drop out of the supply network and its structure will
change.
2.3 Higher resource efﬁciency
For AM processes, only the material that is actually needed
for the ﬁnal part is used. Regardless of the dedicated
technical process, the unused raw material can be (re-)used
for the later production of other parts. Therefore, less
material is required [19], and AM may increase the
resource efﬁciency during production. Classical production
on the other hand has a rather low resource efﬁciency.
There, over 80 % of material is removed from the work
piece [11].
Especially in the aerospace industry, this effect is
referred to as buy-to-ﬂy ratio. The term refers to the weight
ratio of ‘‘...wrought material that is purchased as a block
that is required to form a complex part’’ [11]. Our computational experiments do not address aerospace production in particular but AM production in general.
Nevertheless, we will use the term in this paper for
addressing resource efﬁciency.

3 An optimization model for a two-stage supply
network
For quantifying the effects of AM on supply networks, a
facility location-allocation model was used. The main
characteristics of the considered supply network are discussed in Sect. 3.1. In Sect. 3.2, the corresponding facility
location-allocation model is introduced. Section 3.3
explains how the test data for our 700 test instances has
been created.
3.1 Deﬁnition of supply network
We assume a stylized two-stage supply network. According to
Sect. 2.2, manufacturing of products requires one production
step only. This should apply for both, AM and classical
production technologies. In our model, the different technologies are represented by different buy-to-ﬂy ratios (see
Sect. 3.3.2). A buy-to-ﬂy ratio a of 5 means that ﬁve units of

Page 3 of 14

13

Fig. 1 Basic structure of supply network

material are bought and thereof only one unit goes into the
ﬁnal product. Therefore, the focus is on a two-stage supply
network that consists of three types of nodes: source nodes,
production sites, and customers (see Fig. 1). On the ﬁrst stage
of such a network, the raw materials are transported from the
source nodes (e.g. a harbour) to the production sites. There,
the raw material is transformed into a ﬁnal product. Afterwards, the ﬁnal products are transported from the production
sites to the customers on the second stage of the network.
The raw material to manufacture a ﬁnal product is
assumed to be homogenous. Precursors are also not considered. The amount of the transported goods (raw material
and ﬁnal products) is measured in tonnes. The costs for
transporting the materials and ﬁnal products are calculated
as tonne-kilometres (tkm) using the distance in kilometres
weighted by the weight of goods to be transported.
A source node can supply multiple production sites. A
production site can supply multiple customers. However,
the demand of a customer has to be fulﬁlled by only one
production site. Furthermore, a storage of raw materials or
ﬁnal products at the production sites is forbidden. The
production sites have a capacity restriction on the number
of products to be manufactured. In contrast, transport
relations between the nodes have no capacities. This is
reasonable, because network design is a rather long-term
problem and transport capacities, in particular road transport, are usually easily adaptable.
3.2 Two-stage capacitated facility location problem
According to Sect. 2.3, the use of AM might reduce the
required raw materials in order to produce ﬁnal products.
Therefore, quantity of goods to be transported will change.
But this change is not the only implication for the supply
network. Beyond that the questions arises whether the
locations of our facilities are still adequate in order to
supply our customers if AM is applied within the network?
In the operations research literature, this question is a well
studied. There, the problem is classiﬁed as a facility location problem. Many models for this problem are discussed,
and a comprehensive survey is presented by Klose
and Drexl [14].




In order to model the two-stage supply network at hand,
we decided to use the two-stage capacitated facility location problem (TSCFLP) in the formulation presented by
Klose and Drexl [14] with a slight adjustment. In the
TSCFLP, we are given a set N of nodes. N is divided into a
set I of source nodes, a set J of potential production sites,
and a set K of customer locations.

guarantees that the capacity of a production site sufﬁces to
satisfy the demand of the customers supplied by this production site. The capacity of a source has to be larger than
the transport volume of the assigned production sites (5).
Restriction (6) deﬁnes the ﬂow balance, and the inﬂow of
each production site has to be equal to the outﬂow. Storage
is not possible. Constraint (7) ensures that a source does not
supply more raw materials than required by an open production site. Restriction (8) guarantees that a production
site is open if it supplies goods to a customer location.
Constraints (9) to (11) deﬁne the decision variables.
In contrast to the model of Klose and Drexl [14], we
include the parameter a in restriction (6). This parameter is
denoted as buy-to-ﬂy ratio. It indicates the efﬁciency of the
production process, and lower values of a stand for a higher
efﬁciency. This parameter is changed during the computational experiments in order to introduce the higher
resource efﬁciency of AM into the model.

The capacity of source i and production site j are given by

location k 2 K the demand dk is given. The ﬁxed cost for
opening a production site j is given by fj (j 2 J). The
transport costs on the ﬁrst stage of a network are given by
tij with i 2 I and j 2 J. On the second stage of a network,
the transport costs per unit from a production site j 2 J to a
customer location k 2 K are given by ckj .
The decision variables are xij , yj , and zkj
(i 2 I; j 2 J; k 2 K). xij indicates the transport volume in
tonnes from source node i to production site j. The binary
variable yj indicates if a production site is in use yj ¼ 1
(referred to as open) or not yj ¼ 0. The binary variable zjk
indicates if production site j supplies customer location
k. The TSCFLP is given by (1) to (11).
The objective function (1) minimizes the total costs that
are made up from the transport costs on the ﬁrst and the
second stage of the network plus the costs for opening a
production site. Constraint (2) ensures that each customer
is supplied by exactly one production site. Constraint (3)
ensures that the open production sites on the whole are able
to satisfy the demand of all customers. Constraint (4)

123

The parameters of the TSCFLP represent the required input
data for our experiments. The following parameters were
considered:

•
•

The number of source nodes, production nodes, and
customer nodes as well as
The geographical distribution of these nodes,

The buy-to-ﬂy ratio a, and
Some other parameters, whose values were ﬁxed for all
instances.

We studied seven node allocations, twenty-ﬁve different
geographical distributions, and four buy-to-ﬂy ratios. As a
consequence, 700 instances of the TSCFLP have been
created. This allows a much more in-depth analysis of AM
effects on supply networks as a previous study of ours [3]
which uses only six instances.
3.3.1 Locating nodes of supply networks
A supply network consists of three types of nodes: source
nodes, production nodes, and customer nodes. Just as [3],
the total number of nodes in a network was set to 90. Most
instances of the TSCFLP with 90 or less nodes are solved
via state-of-the-art mixed-integer programming (MIP)
solvers within a few minutes. Table 1 shows the seven used
allocations of source nodes, production nodes, and customer nodes.
The conﬁguration of a supply network is not only

geographical distribution of these network nodes. The
geographical distribution of nodes affects signiﬁcantly
supply relationships between nodes and therefore transport
costs. An equal distribution of nodes over the grid lacks
practical relevance in many cases. We assumed there are
clusters of nodes. For example, production sites may be
clustered in industrial parks which may be close to source
nodes (i.e. seaports) or far away in the hinterland. A
clustering of source nodes could be supported by geographical characteristics, e.g. access to the sea. Clusters
could also form because of urbanization which might imply
fallow lands in other areas of a country. Different clusters
of the three node types were considered in order to take
some of these characteristics into account.
To generate a node set which is geographical distributed, we assumed a 100 Â 100 grid. Given an allocation
Ai (i ¼ 1; . . .; 7) the nodes were placed randomly and
independently of each other on the grid. As Fig. 2 shows,
the x-axis and the y-axis were divided into segments with a
width of 10 units, respectively. 100 squares emerged. For
each node, ﬁrst a square was selected. The selection
probability of this square followed a normal distribution.
Mean and standard deviation of the normal distribution
depended on the desired positions of the clusters. However,
for each type of node the same normal distribution was
applied. Second, after the square was chosen, the exact
location within the 10 Â 10-square was equally likely.
Figure 2 shows an example, where a cluster of nodes
was generated in the north-east region. On both axes, the
mean of the normal distribution was set to 75 and the
standard deviation was set to 20. Sixty nodes are placed
randomly. As intended by the used normal distribution, a
cluster of nodes in the north-east area emerged.
A node distribution in a network is identiﬁed by
quadruple (nw, ne, sw, se). Each element of the quadruple
represents the desired position of a node cluster.
nw, ne, sw, and se denote the north-west, north-east, southwest, and south-east region of the grid. Possible values of
nw, ne, sw, se are S; P; C; ; indicating a source node, a
production node, a customer node, or no clustering.

13

Combinations of S, P and C were possible. Graphically,
this can be illustrated like one of the squares in Fig. 4.
For all instances, source nodes and customer nodes were
placed in one cluster, respectively. However, for production nodes we created a set of instances with one cluster
and another set with two clusters. This allowed us to study
more realistic network structures. Note, using more than
two clusters with the given allocations (see Table 1) leads
to little additional insights, because the node locations
become similar to the equal distribution case.
Grids with one cluster of production nodes. From all
possible combinations of single production clusters on the
grid, only eleven are considered. The main reason to
exclude cluster combinations from the study is rotational
symmetry among the quadruples. An example for rotational symmetry of clusters is given in Fig. 3. Symmetric
quadruples do not have to be considered because they
represent no unique arrangement of clusters.
Figure 4 shows all network structures consisting of only
one cluster per type of node which were used for the computational experiments (C1–C11). In addition, the structure
C11 was created where all nodes are evenly distributed.
Grids with two clusters of production nodes. Other
things being equal, the probability distribution used to
place the production nodes differs in this setting. Two
production clusters were generated using two individual
probability distributions from the single cluster case.
However, for each segment of the axis the higher probability of both probabilities was determined. It was squared
and standardized to 100 % for all segments of the axis.
Figure 5 shows an example of the corresponding probabilities on the axes and two clusters of production nodes in
the north-east and the south-east regions.
When two production clusters are diagonal to each
other, a slightly different treatment was required. Diagonal
means either production clusters in the nw and se regions or
production clusters in the ne and sw regions. If an unwanted region is selected for placing a production site (i.e.
after drawing random numbers for the x-axis and the
y-axis), we dismissed this decision in 85 % of all accounts.
By this, an almost uniform spread of production sites over
the grid in both diagonal cases was avoided.
We created instances for 14 different cluster combinations (see Fig. 4, C12–C25). All of them contain two production clusters. Other cluster combinations were excluded
from the test due to rotational symmetry considerations.
3.3.2 Buy-to-ﬂy ratio a
The buy-to-ﬂy ratio expresses the resource efﬁciency of a
production process. According to Heck et al. [12], Lindemann et al. [15], and Arcam-AB [2], the buy-to-ﬂy ratio for
AM varies between almost a ¼ 1 and a ¼ 3. For




Fig. 2 Example distribution of
60 nodes using normal
distributions on the x-axis and
y-axis, respectively

•

Fig. 3 Comparison of rotationally symmetric distributions of clusters

subtractive production, the buy-to-ﬂy ratio varies between
a ¼ 10 and a ¼ 40 as reported by Dutta and Froes [7] and
Whittaker and Froes [20] for real-world scenarios. Four
different buy-to-ﬂy ratios were considered to allow for a
broad spectrum, i.e. a was set to 2, 5, 10 and 20.

Cost fj for opening a production site j 2 J were set to
fj :¼ 5000. This value equals the average tkm for a
transport in the supply network from a source node to
customer node. The average distance between all
source nodes and all production sites as well as all
production sites and all customers is 50 km each. The
customers demand is uniform randomly drawn between
1 and 100; therefore, the average demand per customer
is 50. We assumed the best possible buy-to-ﬂy ratio
a ¼ 1, i.e. the average transported material is 50 tones
on both stages of transport. Therefore, the average tone
kilometres are 2500 on each stage of transport, in sum
5000.
The demand dk of each customer k 2 K was drawn
uniform randomly between 1 and 100.

3.3.3 Other parameters

The TSCFLP allows to set different capacities for sources
pi and production sites sj , cost for opening production sites
fj as well as demand of customers dk . All of these were set
once and are constant for all instances. The values are:

4.2 Discussion of results

Fig. 4 Studied grids with one (C1 –C11 ) and two (C12 –C25 ) clusters of
production nodes

All 700 instances have been solved by the mixed-integer
programming solver CPLEX 12.5.1 from IBM. First, the
results for 308 instances with one production cluster are
discussed in Sect. 4.2.1. Next, we analyse the results of 392
instances with two production clusters in Sect. 4.2.2.
It goes without saying that the discussion of the effects
of AM on the structure of supply networks is only valid for
the instances at hand used for our stylized model. Nevertheless, this provides a new method of analysing effects of
AM on network structures.

Sect. 4.2.
4.1 Performance indicators
The structural effects of AM on supply networks are
measured and discussed by means of the indicators z1 to z4 :

z1 , the total costs of the network as deﬁned by the
TSCFLP’s objective function (1).
P
1
z2 :¼ jKj ð j2J;k2K dk ckj zkj Þ, the average transport costs
per customer on the second stage of the supply
network. The second stage considers transports
between production sites and customer locations only.
The ﬁrst-stage transportation costs between source
nodes and production sites are not considered because
a lower buy-to-ﬂy ratio requires less raw materials
which obviously reduces the ﬁrst-stage transportation
cost. However, the demand of the customers is
independent of the buy-to-ﬂy ratio which is why the
transport volume on the second stage is constant.
Therefore, z2 might provide useful information about
to what extent transport costs are affected by different
locations of production sites.

Recall, an improved buy-to-ﬂy ratio means a higher resource
efﬁciency of the production process and corresponds to a
lower value of a. Table 2 shows the rounded median indicator values for the 308 single production cluster instances
of the TSCFLP. The instances are divided into four groups
with different buy-to-ﬂy ratios of a ¼ 2; 5; 10; 20. So, each
group comprises 77 different networks. In addition, Fig. 6
shows the median and the 10 and 90 % quantile of the
indicators z1 to z4 for different buy-to-ﬂy ratios. For the sake
of an easy comparison, the results are normalized with the
results for a ¼ 20 deﬁned as 100 percent.
Looking at the median z1 , the total costs decrease in all
cases with an improved (i.e. lower) buy-to-ﬂy ratio. In
addition, even the quantiles are always below the median
value for a ¼ 20 (see Fig. 6). We conclude that in 80 % of
all compared instances an improved buy-to-ﬂy ratio—that
is, a switch to AM production—will reduce total costs of
the network.
Concerning z2 , an improvement of a will lead to lower
transportation costs between production sites and customer
locations on average per customer. However, with the
given data the quantiles always reach the median of the
a ¼ 20-case (see Fig. 6). But different from the effects

observed by means of z1 , a lower a will not always reduce
z2 .
With respect to z3 , the proportion of transportation costs
on the ﬁrst stage and on the second stage shifts to the
second stage. However, using AM changes the proportion
of tkm required on the ﬁrst stage versus those required on
the second stage of the supply network in the same way.
This might be counter-intuitive, because z2 indicated a total
reduction in transport costs on the second stage. The reason
for this is that the buy-to-ﬂy ratio a leads to signiﬁcantly
stronger reduction in the required tkm on the ﬁrst stage.
Especially for a ¼ 2, the quantile range is very broad (see

123

Fig. 6). Compared to a ¼ 20, the share of tkm for a ¼ 2 on
the second stage is over three times higher.
The number of open production sites z4 is slightly
reduced using a better a. Because the values of the other
performance indicators change a lot more depending on a,
we conclude that the number of production sites used does
not affect the costs of the supply network much. However,
when applying a better buy-to-ﬂy ratio in the network,
other possible production sites are opened and therefore the
structure changes.
Apart from an overall analysis, a more detailed view on
the cluster structures as well as on the allocation of nodes
shows that the results are especially dependent on the
number of the customers and clusters of at least two types
of nodes. Table 3 shows the median values of the performance indicators classiﬁed for the allocation of numbers
and clusters of nodes.
In case of an allocation A1 and A3 (see Table 3), there
are 60 customers to be supplied. On the other hand, the
number of production sites is rather low with 10 or 20,
respectively. To fulﬁl the demand of the customers, 9
production sites have to be opened. Only little cost

that if there are only few possible production sites to
choose from, using AM improves the supply network only
marginal. There are different allocations from production
sites to customers, but overall the beneﬁt through the use of
AM is low, because either way almost every production
site has to be opened to fulﬁl the customer’s demand.
If production sites and customers are located in the same
region of the grid, AM, respectively a lower a, results in
high cost reductions. This is the case for clusters C8 and C9
(see Table 3). There, production sites and customers are
located in the same region. By applying a lower a especially, the average transport costs per customer on the
second stage of the supply network drop at least 17 up to
30 percent. We conclude that even though the production
sites and customers are already clustered in the same region
the production sites move closer to the customers with a
lower a.
Summarizing the computational experiments of the 308
single cluster instances, we conclude that the general
results of Barz et al. [3] on the effects of AM on supply
networks are reﬂected in our experiments, too. The total
costs decrease, the proportion of transports costs shifts
towards the second stage of transport, the costs of transport
between production sites and the customer locations on
average per customer drop and the number of production
sites used is relatively steady. Additional conclusions are
drawn from the different geographical distributions of the
nodes and varying numbers of each node type. The biggest
improvements by using AM production arise if the number
of possible production sites to chose from is high. However, the number of production sites changes rarely.

Furthermore, the effect of AM is large, if the clusters of
two types of nodes are located nearby at the same geographical area. This is especially true for production sites
and customer locations, which are close together. Vice
versa the change to AM production in networks with only
few production sites to chose, and/or clusters located at
different spots, results in minor beneﬁts. With respect to
supply network effects, AM production has the highest
impact if the supply network is ﬂexible, i.e. if it is possible
to change locations of the production sites.
4.2.2 Analysis of networks with two production clusters
The aggregated results for the two production cluster case
are given in Table 5. It indicates the median of the indicator
values for 392 test instances.
A better buy-to-ﬂy ratio, i.e. using AM, improves the
performance indicators. That is, total costs z1 reduce, the
average tkm per customer on the second stage of transport
z2 reduce, and a shift of transport share towards the second
stage z3 occurs. The number of required production sites z4
remains unchanged. Compared to grids with one production cluster the total cost z1 is signiﬁcantly lower. The other
performance indicators z2 , z3 , and z4 are approximately on
the same level.
If subtractive production technologies are used, we
conclude that supply networks consisting of two production
clusters are superior compared to single production cluster
networks. Analogous to one production cluster grids, the
use of AM reduces the total costs of the supply network.
Since the number of opened production sites remains

unchanged and the average tkm per customer on the second
stage of transport drop, we conclude that production sites
are opened closer to the customer, too.
Table 6 compares the performance indicators of one and
two production cluster networks; the values for a ¼ 20 are
ﬁxed to 100 % and the remaining values are scaled
accordingly. Roughly speaking, the effects are similar to
those shown in Fig. 6. From a more pairwise comparison of
corresponding indicator values, one can conclude that
networks with two production clusters proﬁt stronger from
the introduction of AM than one production cluster grids.
Again, the number of open productions sites z4 remains
unchanged independently of the chosen a-value.
Table 4 shows the performance indicators for allocations A1 to A7 and clusters C12 to C25 for two production
cluster networks. The effect of AM appears to superpose
the different geographical layouts, because the performance values behave in a similar way like those in Table 3
for the one production cluster case.
Looking at the two production clusters grids C23 , C25
and the one production cluster grids C10 , the performance
indicators have the lowest, i.e. the best values. In these
cases, the clusters are highly concentrated in one region of
the grid, i.e. number of nodes located in this region is very
high and very low in the other regions. Therefore, the
transport distances are low and also the total costs in this
supply networks are low as well. Nevertheless, introducing
AM might still lead to signiﬁcant beneﬁts, see e.g. the
reduction in total costs z1 of C23 . So, if a supply network is
already highly competitive due to favourably geographical
node distribution, it can and will still highly beneﬁt from
AM.

4.2.3 Other cost effects
Our computational experiments focus on the structure and
transport costs of a supply network and how it changes if
AM as a production technology is introduced within this
network. Other costs and cost effects, which are directly
linked to the production of the part, are not considered
within the computational experiments. For example, these
cost (effects) could be raw material costs, economies of
scale, etc. Although we did not consider these costs and
cost effects, respectively, a few general statements concerning these are possible.
Direct production costs are independently of the production site used. Imagine raw material costs. If AM is
used less raw material and therefore less transports from
sources to production sites are needed. The transport costs
will drop. On the other hand, the costs for raw material for
AM may be higher because of higher technical requirements. Both aspects inﬂuence production costs. However,
these effects will always arise regardless of the production
site used.
Concerning economies of scale, we assumed a constant
demand of the customers in our simulation experiments.
Therefore, the production volume is constant as well.
Because of that economies of scale do not arise regardless
of the production technology used. But if the production
volume at a production site is increased to generate
economies of scale, this will ceteris paribus lead to
increased transports from/to this dedicated production site
and therefore to higher transport costs. Therefore, the
consideration of economies of scale is only reasonable, if
the savings in production costs itself exceed the increased
transport costs.

5 Conclusion and outlook
Additive manufacturing (AM) disseminates more and more
and replaces or complements classic subtractive manufacturing processes. This will also affect the organization of
today’s supply networks. To the knowledge of the authors,
there are little approaches that try to quantify potential

study provides a novel framework on how to measure these
potential effects. We used a well-known facility locationallocation problem to model a two-stage supply network.
An extensive test data set of 700 instances has been created
which provides the basis for our experiments. These
instances represent a wide variety of geographical constellations of a supply network. In particular, different
types of clusters of source nodes, production sites, and
customer locations are included. A main assumption for
our experiments was that AM increases the resource efﬁciency of a production process: the same amount of output
is generated with less input material. This is implemented
by the buy-to-ﬂy ratio a. Given equal customer demand,
the buy-to-ﬂy ratio is the main factor that inﬂuences the
amount of goods to be transported in a supply network. To
measure important effects, we introduced four performance
indicators.
Our computational experiments provide insights into the
effects of AM on supply networks. Increasing the resource
efﬁciency through AM can have a signiﬁcant impact on the
structure of supply networks. Our experiments conﬁrm in
general that production sites will be located closer to the
customers. Therefore, the total tonne-kilometres as well as
the required tonne-kilometres per customer decrease,
which decreases the overall transportation costs. This study
supports the ﬁndings suggested by Barz et al. [3]. However,
Barz et al. [3] used a tiny test data set only, i.e. six handmade test instances. The experiments presented provide a
broader foundation which improves the validity and the
insights of the results signiﬁcantly. For this reason, however, we also observed that not all supply networks change
in the same way; the intensity of the effects can vary
strongly. In order that a supply network beneﬁts from AM
it is important that switching production sites is easy, that
is, there has to be a high number of possible production
sites selectable and the switching costs have to be low
enough. The observed effects result from a comparison of
production processes with a high resource efﬁciency versus
processes with a low resource efﬁciency. The next stage
would be to also model transition effects which arise from
switching from subtractive to additive manufacturing, e.g.
higher costs for machinery or slower time of production or
maybe even changes in the production programme or the
customer demand. Of course, supply networks with a more
generalized network structure than our used two-stage
network should also be investigated in the future.
