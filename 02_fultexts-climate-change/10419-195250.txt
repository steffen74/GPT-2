Both Buenos Aires and Chicago grew enormously over the late nineteenth century
as nodes of a transportation network that brought the produce of the New World’s
rich, but relatively unpopulated, hinterlands to the tables of the world. (Figure 1
shows the parallel population growth of both places.) In the early 1900s, the two
cities dominated meat-packing in the Americas and were great centers of grain
shipments. About one-half of the populations of both cities were immigrants, who
had come to take advantage of high wages in these urban areas. Both cities were
governed by functioning but imperfect democracies, and both were famous for their
corruption.
Over the course of the twentieth century, the paths of the two cities have, of
course, signiﬁcantly diverged, just as the paths of Argentina and the U.S. have
diverged. Buenos Aires has had faster population growth, but Chicago has become
much richer and has also been generally free of the regime-changing political
uprisings that have challenged the Argentine capital.1 In this paper, we ask whether
differences between the cities at the start of the twentieth century can help us to
make sense of their divergent paths since then.
On a functional level, the cities in 1900s appear quite similar. In both cases, rail
lines brought wheat and beef into the port. From there, the beef was processed and
the produce shipped east. The stockyards that carve up cattle and pigs are big
employers in both places. Refrigeration signiﬁcantly aids the exports of both cities.
By 1910, the income gap between the two cities had closed to the point where real
wages were about 70% higher in Chicago, which is substantially less than the gap
was in 1890 or today.
Yet there were signiﬁcant differences in Chicago and Buenos Aires even in 1910,
beyond that income gap. First, the education levels of Chicago residents seem to
have been much higher. This difference does not reﬂect educational enrollments,
which seem broadly similar after 1884 Argentine education reform. Instead, the
adults coming into Buenos Aires seem to have been much less educated than those
coming into Chicago. The main reason for this difference is that rural–urban
migrants in the U.S. were much better educated, reﬂecting the strength of the
American common school movement in the early nineteenth century. Chicago also
had more German immigrants, who were relatively well educated, while Buenos
Aires disproportionately attracted immigrants from the less well-educated countries
of Spain and Italy.
Second, Chicago moved much more quickly towards being an industrial producer
as well as a transformer of raw commodities. Capital per worker appears to have
been about 2.44 times higher in Chicago than in Buenos Aires in 1914. Value added
per worker appears to have been 2.25 times higher in Chicago, which can readily
explain the 70% wage gap. Chicago’s production of goods was, to a large extent,
oriented towards providing goods for the prosperous Midwestern hinterland. The

The events at the 1968 Democratic Convention were as close as Chicago ever came to toppling a
government. While many observers link the Chicago riots with Richard Nixon’s success in the election, it
remains true that Nixon came to power through an electoral process that is quite different from the paths

market for Buenos Aires-made manufactured goods was much smaller, because the
Argentine farmers were much poorer. Moreover, Chicago had a long track record of
innovation, and in many areas, such as mechanical reapers, it was on the forefront of
new technologies. By contrast, Argentina was an importer of technological ideas
through much of the twentieth century. Chicago’s higher human capital levels may
help explain why Chicago was more technologically developed, but in any event, by
1930, Chicago is essentially an industrial town, while Buenos Aires is still focused
on raw food production and commerce.
Last but not least, political forces in Buenos Aires and Chicago were different.
While Chicago had universal manhood suffrage since the Civil War, Buenos Aires
had a much more limited electoral base until 1914. More importantly, Buenos Aires
is Argentina’s capital while Chicago is not the capital of the U.S. The combination
of commerce and politics in Buenos Aires means that uprisings in the city have the
ability to topple national governments. Comparable uprisings in Chicago, such as
the Haymarket riot, were only of local concern. The concentration of population in
Buenos Aires seems to have made the country less politically stable.
In the fourth section of this paper, we attempt to assess the relative importance of
these difference factors by using cross-national evidence. Inevitably; this pulls us
away from a city-level focus to a more national perspective. We examine the ability
of pre-World War I variables, including income, industrialization, education,
urbanization and political instability to explain cross-section income variation
today. All of these variables are strongly correlated with current per capita GDP
levels, but measures of schooling in 1900 have the strongest connection to modern
mechanical decomposition, explain almost all of the differences in current income
levels.
But why is the connection between historical education levels and current income
so tight? The direct effect of education on earnings can explain only a small portion
of the link. Education, however, is also correlated with political outcomes.
Stable democracies are much rarer in less well-educated countries (Glaeser et al.
2007). Lower levels of education in Argentina can help us to understand that
nation’s twentieth century political problems. However, education also seems to
have a strong direct impact on national income levels, which can, perhaps be
understood as stemming from the connection between area-level human capital and
the state of technological development.

2 Chicago del Plata; Buenos Aires on Lake Michigan
We begin by stressing the profound similarities between the economic models of
Chicago and Buenos Aires in the nineteenth century. As late as 1880, 72% of the
U.S. population was rural. The great wealth of the country came from its vast
expanses of fertile land. No area was more fertile than the hinterland of Chicago:
Illinois and Iowa. The rich black soil of America’s Corn Belt yielded an average of
39 bushels per acre in 1880, about 50% more than the older corn producing areas of
Kentucky. That higher productivity explains why Chicago passed Cincinnati as
America’s pig-producing polis.
America’s vast hinterland was enormously rich, but at the start of the nineteenth
century that land was virtually inaccessible. It cost as much to ship goods 32 miles
over land as it did to ship them across the ocean. Over the course of the nineteenth
century, Americans built a transportation network that managed to move
agricultural produce far more cheaply over space. Cities, like Chicago and
Cincinnati, were nodes on that transportation network. Typically, large cities
formed in places where goods needed to move from one form of transport to
another.
The growth of Chicago depended on two canals. The ﬁrst canal, the Erie,
connected the great lakes to the Hudson River, and through it the city of Chicago
was able to ship by water all the way to New York and the outside world. The
second canal was the Illinois and Michigan canal, which connected the Chicago
River to the Mississippi River system. Chicago’s ﬁrst boom decades, the 1830s,
coincided with speculation related to the completion of the canal. Those two canals
situated Chicago as the lynchpin of a watery arc that ran from New Orleans to New
York.
As it turned out, railroads became even more important in connecting Chicago to
the west. Starting in 1848, the Chicago and Galena railroad connected the city
westward. While initially intended to move lead, the rail connected to Iowa and
became a conduit for agricultural produce, particularly pigs. Corn is an enormously
calorie-intensive crop, but it is relatively expensive to ship. Hence corn was
Typically, mankind has tended to be more interested in salted pig products
(bacon, sausage, ham) than in salted beef products. For that reason, in the middle
nineteenth century, pigs were slaughtered in Chicago before their movement east,
while cows were shipped live. One great transport innovation in nineteenth century
Chicago was the four-season refrigerated rail car, used by Gustavus Swift. (His
engineer’s brilliant insight was to put the ice on top of the meat so it dripped down.)
After Swift began using refrigerated cars, Chicago increasingly shipped prepared
beef, instead of cattle on the hoof, as well as prepared pigs.
The ﬁnal element in Chicago’s agricultural shipping empire was its increasing
role as a center for grain shipments. Wheat has less value per ton than pork or beef,
and as a result high shipping costs in the middle nineteenthth century meant that
wheat typically traveled short distances. Rochester, New York, for example was
America’s ﬂour city in its early years, specializing in milling grain on its way to
New York City. As transportation costs fell, and as hard spring wheat made the cold
areas north of Chicago more productive, wheat increasingly came east from the old
northwest. Chicago, as the Midwest’s premier transport center, became a conduit for
shipping grain as well as shipping beef and pork.
Buenos Aires’ evolution in the nineteenthth century is broadly similar to that of
Chicago. The similarities start with the fact that what turned Buenos Aires into a
major commercial hub was its exceptionally fertile hinterland, rather than an
exceptionally located port (at least when compared to possible competitors such as
Montevideo). The developments in terms of the accessibility of this hinterland to the
main networks of international trade were once again the key in determining the
patterns followed by the city’s evolution. In 1850, transportation across the Atlantic
was slow and expensive, dependent on sailing ships. Argentina, therefore,
specialized in exporting products that were extremely durable, such as hides and
tallow. In the 1840s, Buenos Aires was exporting more than 2 million hides per year
and 10,000 tons of tallow (Brown 1976). Wool was also a major export. Notably,
these were the same products being produced in the region around Los Angeles
around the same time and for the same reason. Distant places with abundant land
were best used to produce goods that could last for months during a long sea
voyage.
Over the course of the nineteenthth century, Argentina moved to higher value
agricultural products, ﬁrst meat and then grain. In the middle years of the
nineteenthth century, Argentina was further away from European markets and had a
much higher ratio of land to population than the U.S. For example, in 1880,
Argentina was composed of 2.7 million square kilometers and had around 2.5
million people. The U.S. had 8 million square kilometers of land and 50 million
people. The vast amounts of space in Argentina made herding relatively more
attractive than intensive agriculture. While Argentina actually imported breadstuffs
from Chile, in the mid-1870s, it had more than 45 million sheep and more than 5
million cattle. Since cattle and sheep complement open ranges more than pigs, beef
became the primary export item for Argentina. They were, of course, and still are
thousand tons per year during the 1850s). The market for salted beef, such as beef
jerky, was never particularly robust and this limited the growth of Argentine export
trade. Two big transport innovations, however, enabled Argentina to grow
dramatically as a meat exporter. First, starting in the 1840s, steam replaced sail
on the cross-Atlantic journeys, reducing travel times by as much as two-thirds (from
over 70 days to less than 25). Second, in 1875, refrigerated ships, or frigorıﬁcos,
´
made it possible to ship chilled beef and mutton. The impact of refrigeration was
even greater on Buenos Aires than it was in Chicago, because the distances between
Buenos Aires and London precluded the shipment of live cattle in large numbers
before the 1880s.
With the coming of the frigorıﬁcos, Buenos Aires became a large exporter of
´
frozen and chilled beef and mutton. During the early years of chilled transport,
mutton was actually a more important export than beef, because ‘‘mutton, unlike
beef, is not injured materially in quality, ﬂavor and appearance by the freezing and
thawing process,’’ (Hanson 1938, p. 84). By 1892, Argentina was exporting more
than a million sheep carcasses annually. Faster transportation was also making it
easier to export vast amounts of live cattle and sheep to the United Kingdom and
other European markets, and by the turn of the century, 500,000 live sheep and
100,000 live cattle were being exported annually from Argentina to the England.
The vast increase in the amount of chilled beef exported from Argentina, much of
it through Buenos Aires, actually occurred during the early years of the twentieth
century. Between 1900 and 1916, Argentina’s exports of frozen beef increased from
26,000 tons to 411,000 tons. About a third of those frozen carcasses were coming
through the port of Buenos Aires, which was growing as a center for slaughtering
and refrigeration, as well as shipping.
The ﬁnal step in the agricultural development of Argentina also mirrors the
changes in Chicago. Just as the decline in shipping costs made it more attractive to
ship wheat from the west to New York via Chicago, easier shipping costs made
wheat a more attractive export for Argentina. As late as the 1870s, Argentina was
exporting essentially no wheat. By 1904, the Argentines were exporting more than
two million tons of it per year.
The growth of the wheat trade was accompanied by a vast transformation on the
Pampas. Land that had been used as open range became used for intensive wheat
cultivation. By 1910, 10 million acres in the province of Buenos Aires were being
used to grow wheat. The population of Buenos Aires’ hinterland rose dramatically
as immigrants came to farm. In 30 years, Argentina moved from having essentially
no cereal production to becoming one of the world’s three largest grain exporters.
The roots of this transformation also lay in better transportation technologies.
Across the Atlantic, faster and faster steam ships made it cheaper to ship grain.
Starting in the 1850s, a rail network was created within Argentina, generally
supported by the government and mostly connecting Buenos Aires to places in the
hinterland. (In yet another interesting parallel, just as a New England-born shipping
magnate, John Murray Forbes, built some of the ﬁrst rails that connected Chicago, a
New England-born shipping magnate, William Wheelwright, built some of the ﬁrst
crucially, it made it less expensive to ship grain to the capital. While cattle and
sheep could walk on their own to the port, grain always needed to be shipped. As a
result, grain particularly beneﬁted from the improvements in rail.
In sum, like Chicago, Buenos Aires initial attraction was its harbor and
waterways—the River Plata was an avenue into the interior—located next to an
exceptionally fertile hinterland. The rail network, which centered at the capital, only
increased Buenos Aires’ place at the hub of Argentina’s internal transport network,
just as rail only increased Chicago’s importance in the Midwest. The comparison
did not escape contemporary observers, such as U.S. Trade Commissioner Herman
G. Brock, who noted that ‘‘like Chicago, [Buenos Aires] has all the resources of the
broad pampas at its doors and is the terminus of a dozen railways whose network of
transportation covers the Republic from north to south and east to west, all feeding
directly or indirectly into the capital’’ (Brock 1919, p. 13).
By 1910 both Chicago and Buenos Aires were ‘‘nature’s metropolises.’’ Both
cities had grown great as conduits that moved the wealth of American hinterlands to
more densely populated markets. In both cases, beef and wheat played a
disproportionate role in the commerce of the cities. In both cases, improved
shipping technologies, especially refrigeration, enabled the cities to grow.
Yet the twentieth century time paths of these places were quite different. By
population, Buenos Aires grew faster, but by most other measures of progress
Chicago dramatically passed its southern rival, just as the income gap between the
U.S. and Argentina widened. Is it possible to see, in the differences between the two
cities a century ago, the roots of their twentieth century divergence?

3 Four differences between Buenos Aires and Chicago in 1910
In this section, we discuss four major areas in which Buenos Aires and Chicago
differed a century ago. In the next section, we connect these differences to the
history of the cities and their countries since then.
3.1 Incomes
Income levels are the natural starting point for understanding what was similar and
different between the U.S. and Argentina, so we ﬁrst look at wage data for the two
countries (plus Great Britain and Italy) from 1870 to 1970 (data from Williamson
1995b) in Fig. 2a–c. (The wages are normalized so that the British wage in 1905
equals 100.) At the start of the time period, wages in the United States are more than
50% higher than wages either in Great Britain or Argentina. Wages in those places
are about the same and about double the wages in Italy.
Between 1870 and the early 1890s, Argentina experienced a remarkable 66%
increase in real wages. Argentina’s spectacular real wage increase was accompanied
by, and probably created by, the aforementioned improvements in shipping
technology that enabled Argentine mutton and beef to efﬁciently be shipped to

Evidence and Hypotheses’’

ship meat quickly and that seems to have greatly increased the marginal
productivity of labor.
Argentina was not alone in experiencing real wage increases during the late
nineteenth century. American wages increased by amount the same proportion, so
that in 1892 (a high water mark for Argentine wages), American wages remained
60% above those in Argentina. Wages in Argentina and Britain remained quite
similar and about double the wages in Italy, which sent many immigrants to the U.S.
and Argentina during this period. Spain, another exporter of people to Argentina,
also had wages that were about one-half of those in Argentina.
Of course, these aggregate wage series do not particularly tell us about similar
workers in the two cities. To make the scales somewhat more comparable, Fig. 3
shows monthly wages in Chicago from the U.S. Census in 1939 dollars. In Chicago,
these wages rose substantially over the 1880s and then remained remarkably static
in real terms from 1890 to 1920. Over this time period, of course, the size of
Chicago’s large force was increasing dramatically. The city expanded from 500,000
to 2.7 million. That vast inﬂux of labor surely played a major role in keeping wage
growth modest. The slower population growth over the 1920s, when America
substantially reduced the ﬂow of foreign immigrants, may explain rising real wages
during that decade.

use national industrial data. However, much of Argentina’s industry was in the
capital, so this should give us some sense about wage levels for manufacturing
workers in Buenos Aires. While there are many ups and downs, over the whole
period, Argentine industrial workers become steadily better paid, as shown in the
Williamson data. Throughout the entire period, however, the workers in Chicago
were earning more in real terms than the workers in Buenos Aires. During most of
the time, the wage gap was approximately 70%. At the start of the century, before
the great divergence, there was already a very substantial income gap between the
two cities.
Why were the workers in Chicago, many of whom were doing comparable
things, earning much more? Classical economics pushes us to consider wages as the
intersection of labor supply and labor demand. Labor demand, in turn, reﬂects the
marginal productivity of labor. The higher wages in Chicago, therefore, imply that
labor was more productive in that city. Why?
There are three primary hypotheses. First, the workers in Chicago had more skills
than the workers in Buenos Aires. We will treat this hypothesis in the next section,
where we document signiﬁcantly greater education levels in Chicago. This gap
surely explains some of the difference. However, evidence on wages and schooling
from within the U.S. makes it clear that education differences alone cannot explain
the gap.
A second hypothesis is that Buenos Aires and Chicago had different amounts of
capital, and greater capital levels in Chicago increased the productivity of workers
in that city. We will turn to that hypothesis later, when we address the industrial
mixes of the two cities. Chicago appears to have had about 2.44 times more capital
worker, which in a standard Cobb–Douglas production function might suggest that
wages would be 30% higher in Chicago. This can explain almost one-half of the
gap.
Finally, a third hypothesis is that Chicago ﬁrms were more productive, either
because of more advanced technologies or because of the greater distances between
Buenos Aires and European markets meant that Argentine products were worth less,
at their point of production. The American workers were often much closer to their
customers and this decreased one cost of reduction and thereby increased the
marginal productivity of labor.
The labor supply curve also gives us information about the reasons for and the
nature of wage disparity between Chicago and Buenos Aires. Both cities attracted
very signiﬁcant amounts of immigration between 1890 and 1910. The 1910 census
shows that 36% of Chicago’s white residents were foreign born, out of which 16%
were from Russia, 23% were from Germany, 17% were from Austria and 6% were
Italian. In Buenos Aires, the estimates from the Buenos Aires Statistical Annual
(Anuario Estadistico de la Ciudad de Buenos Aires 1925) indicate that the city’s
population increased by 140% over those two decades, and more than half of that
increase was due to immigration. As a result of this massive inﬂow, 50% of Buenos
Aires’ residents were foreign born in 1914. Buenos Aires’ immigrant population
was by then overwhelmingly Spanish and Italian, as can be gleaned from the
total foreign-born population of the country.
The fact that Italian immigrants were going in large numbers to both Buenos
Aires and Chicago is puzzling if the real wage differences are actually of the order
of 70%. Why would an Italian immigrant choose Buenos Aires over America
knowing that real wages are likely to be so much less? There are three possible
explanations for this phenomenon. First, it is possible that Buenos Aires offered
amenities, like a better climate and a different culture, that were missing in Chicago.
Second, the immigrants going to Chicago and Buenos Aires might have actually
been quite different. Third, the real wage differences might have been smaller than
they appear.
The ﬁrst hypothesis surely has some truth to it. The fact that Spaniards were
drawn to Buenos Aires, despite lower real wages, would not seem like that much of
a puzzle. After all, Argentina is a Spanish-speaking country with a Latin culture.
The attraction of Buenos Aires is understandable. Italians were also attracted to
Buenos Aires because of the similarity in languages (and culture) between Italy and
Spain.
There were also substantial differences in the populations going to the U.S. and
Argentina. For example, between 1884 and 1886, two-thirds of the Italian
immigrants coming to Argentina were from Northern Italy. During the same years,
85% of Italian immigrants coming to the U.S. were from the south. During later
periods, the differences narrowed: in the 1907–1909 period; the number of southern
Italian immigrants to Buenos Aires had soared, and 31% of the Italian immigrants
came from the north. Still, that number was much higher than in the U.S. where only
9% of Italian immigrants came from Northern Italy.
The somewhat different regional origins suggests that, at least during the earlier
periods, the U.S. had greater attraction for the southerners while Argentina had
greater attraction for the northerners. The Northerners were generally much more
skilled: only about 12% of the northerners were illiterate, while 54% of the
southerners were illiterate. One interpretation is that the Southerners went to
America, where industrial wages were higher. The northerners, however, saw
greater returns to going to Buenos Aires, which was notably lacking in more skilled
workers. (As we will see in the next section, Buenos Aires was, throughout most of
the period, a signiﬁcantly less well educated city than Chicago.) This suggests that
the overall pattern of higher wages in Chicago might mask heterogeneity in the
wage differentials for different skill proﬁles.
Finally, the pull that Buenos Aires had to many immigrants does suggest that real
wages might not have been quite as low as they seem relative to the U.S. The
economic question is how much of a real wage discount would immigrants have
been willing to accept to live in Buenos Aires rather than in the U.S. This remains
an open question.
In any event, the weight of evidence suggests that, one century ago, Chicago
already had higher income levels than Buenos Aires. The next two subsections will
While wages were certainly lower in Buenos Aires than in Chicago, wages—
correcting for education—differ less. The Argentines appear to have been
signiﬁcantly less educated for much of this time period. Unfortunately, literacy
remains the primary means of measuring education levels, and that, of course, is a
quite coarse measure. Nonetheless, Fig. 4 shows literacy rates for Buenos Aires and
Chicago during our period.
In Chicago, overall literacy rates for the population aged ten or older start above
95% in 1870 and stay at that level for the next 60 years. There is a gap between
native and foreign born, but even among foreign born Chicago residents’ literacy is
never less than 87%. Native literacy is always over 98%, suggesting that pretty
much everyone in the city knew how to both read and write.
By contrast, the Buenos Aires data suggest that less than one-half of the
population could both read and write in 1869. By 1895, the next available data
point, the literacy rate had shot up to 72%, which still meant that a substantial
portion of the population was unable to either read or write. It is not until 1939 that
more than 90% of the population in Buenos Aires is literate. The data are not
entirely comparable since they refer to different age groups; still the differences are
quite striking.
Why is there such a difference in literacy rates between the two cities? Table 1
shows school enrollment rates over time for Chicago and Buenos Aires. While
enrollment rates are somewhat higher in the U.S., the rates seem much closer than
the literacy rates would suggest. The political leaders who came to power after
Rosas, such as Mitre and especially Sarmiento in the 1860s and 1870s, were quite

committed to public schooling. In 1884, Argentine law made free, secular public
schools a right—the Ley 1420 enacted by President Roca, and pushed by Sarmiento
in his post-presidency role as head of the National Education Council. There are
good reasons to believe that these schooling efforts were particularly successful in
the capital, as is apparent from the enrollment data. As such, we can not explain the
literacy gap with different enrollment rates alone.
One explanation for the difference is that immigrants who came to Argentina
were signiﬁcantly less literate than their American counterparts. Just as in the U.S.,
there is a gap between native and foreign born Argentines. In 1904, for example,
89% of native Argentines were literate, but only 72% of the foreign born in the city
could read and write. In 1900 Chicago, by contrast, 93% of the foreign born were
literate. Chicago’s more Germanic population appears to have been much more
skilled than the southern Europeans who came to Argentina. Even though Argentina
received a higher share of northern Italians, this did not overcome the basic pattern
of attracting much less literate people.
The skill differences between Buenos Aires and Chicago do not just reﬂect
differences in foreign immigration. They also reﬂect the different levels of
schooling in the American hinterland. Chicago was a city of immigrants, but it was
also a city full of farm boys and girls who had come to town. Likewise, a large share
of Buenos Aires residents was born outside the city in Argentina. While school
enrollment rates look broadly similar between Buenos Aires and Chicago, outside of
the cities the differences in schooling look rather more substantial.
During the ﬁrst part of the nineteenth century, American rural areas had
embraced the common school movement. Farmers throughout the country had been
convinced that educating their children was a worthwhile endeavor that would make
them more productive. By contrast, the large ranches that predominated in the
in intensive agriculture. Land appears to have been much more widely owned in the
U.S., and skills were presumably higher for yeomen farmers than for gauchos.
As a result, the rural areas that fed people to Chicago were reasonably well
schooled. The hinterland of Argentina was not, at least prior to 1880. For example,
the 1869 census shows that, even after the public education initiatives of the Mitre
presidency (although still at the outset of the heavily education-minded Sarmiento
presidency), only one in ﬁve Argentinean school-age children were enrolled in
school. Since that includes data on Buenos Aires, we are led to conclude that the
situation in the hinterland was considerably worse than that.
How much of an earnings wedge can be explained by literacy alone? Using data
on wages by occupation in 1940 (the ﬁrst time such data are available), we can
estimate a 1940 wage for each occupation in the 1900 U.S. Census. We then
estimate the average 1940 wage earned by literate and illiterate Chicagoans.
We ﬁnd that the average wage earned by an illiterate was 56 log points lower
than the average wage earned by someone who could read and write. That premium
survives controlling for individual age, and controlling for country of origin reduces
the measured premium to 34 log points.
While that premium is extremely signiﬁcant, it is not enough to explain most, or
even much, of the wage gap between Chicago and Buenos Aires at the turn of the
last century. 16% more of Argentina’s population was illiterate than the Chicago’s
population. Multiplying 16% by even a 56% wage loss leads to an estimate that
Buenos Aires should have had 8% higher wages if illiteracy was the only thing
holding them back. This modest number is dwarfed by the actual 70% wage gap.
Of course, illiteracy is presumably just proxying for a large educational gap
between the two groups. Still the wage gap seems far too large to be explained by
education alone in a simple model where human capital produces productivity. If
the returns to schooling were about 7% per annum, then Chicagoans would need to
have the equivalent of 10 extra years of schooling to explain the observed wage
difference, which is wildly implausible.
It is, of course, possible that wages impact earnings directly and through human
capital externalities. An example of such externalities might be that more education
leads to more innovation and better technology for everyone. In that case, the
impact of greater skills in Chicago would be larger. Still, we suspect that this effect
would show up mainly in the occupational and industrial distribution of the two
countries, and we turn to that next.
3.3 Industrialization
Both Chicago and Buenos Aires owed their growth to their roles as centers for the
shipment of natural produce. Both cities also developed other industries which
produced goods for people living in the hinterland and the residents of the city itself.
Cyrus McCormick is the quintessential example of an industrialist who moved his
mechanical reaper operation to Chicago in order to be close to his customers, the
farmers of the Midwest. Buenos Aires also had its industrialists, like Ernesto
and was far more capital-intensive on the eve of World War I. By 1900, 15% of
Chicago’s population, 262,261 workers, labored in industrial pursuit. Four years
later, only 7% of Buenos Aires’ population, 68,512 people, were in manufacturing.
After that point, however, the share of Chicago’s workers in manufacturing
stagnated while the share of Buenos Aires workers in manufacturing continued to
rise. As a result, their employment in industry converged. By 1914, Chicago had
313,000 industrial workers, or 13% of the city’s population. Buenos Aires province
had 149,000 industrial workers, which was 9.4% of the city’s population.
These similar employment shares were not matched by similar levels of output.
In 1914, the U.S. Census writes that the value of Chicago’s industrial output is 1.48
billion dollars (or 30 billion in current dollars); the value added by manufacturing
was 581 billion dollars (or about 12 billion dollars today). Each Chicago worker was
associated with 4728 dollars of output (about 100,000 dollars today) or 1856 dollars
of value added (about 38,000 dollars today).
In Buenos Aires, total output was 280 million dollars and value added was 122
million dollars. On a per capita basis, each Buenos Aires worker was producing
1880 dollars worth of output (or 38,000 dollars today) and 819 dollars of value
added (about 17,000 dollars today). Per worker output was 2.5 times higher in
Chicago than in Buenos Aires. Per worker value added appears to have been 2.25
times higher in Chicago than it was in Buenos Aires. This difference in productivity
is much larger than the 70% difference in manufacturing incomes that we found
during this time period.
Why was manufacturing more productive in Chicago than in Buenos Aires? One
hypothesis is that the level of capital per worker was higher in Chicago. In 1914, the
total capital in the manufacturing sector was 1.19 billion dollars or 3800 dollars per
worker (78,000 today). In 1914, Buenos Aires had 231 million dollars worth of
capital or 1550 dollars per worker (32,000 today). The Chicago workers had 2.44
times more capital per worker which may help to explain the higher levels of
productivity.
Using a standard Cobb–Douglas production function, we can estimate whether
these capital differences can help explain the labor productivity differences across
space. This assumes that output equals AKaL1-a, where A reﬂects productivity,
K reﬂects capital, L reﬂects labor and a reﬂects capital’s share in output (typically
taken to be one-third). This equation then implies that per worker productivity
equals A(K/L)a, which would equal A times the capital to labor ratio to the power
1/3. If the capital/labor ratio was 2.44 times higher in Chicago than in Buenos Aires,
this would predict that productivity would be 34% higher in Chicago. Thus, higher
capital levels alone can only explain about 27% of the higher productivity levels in
Chicago. The remaining 73% of the gap in productivity must be associated with the
catchall variable ‘‘A’’, which describes total factor productivity. To explain a 125%
greater productivity per worker in Chicago, total factor productivity must be 67%
higher in that city.
The productivity gap can come from three sources: human capital, transportation
costs and technological development. We have already noted that human capital
number of workers times human capital per worker, implies that per capita
productivity will increase by human capital to the power 2/3. If Chicago’s workers
had 20% more human capital per worker (which seems high), then this would
predict a 13% increase in productivity in Chicago, which can explain another 10%
of the observed productivity difference.
This would leave about 60% of the productivity difference to be explained by
differences in ‘‘A’’, the productivity parameter, reﬂecting either more developed
technologies or easier access to consumer markets. It is difﬁcult to determine how
much of the difference in productivity can be explained by either force. Chicago’s
industrialists certainly found it easier to sell to a much richer and larger market in
the United States. The total GDP of the U.S. was about 18 times larger than the GDP
of Argentina in 1913. Argentina’s hinterland was ﬁlled with large numbers of
relatively poor people; the farmers of the Midwest were much wealthier.
In principle, Argentina could have exported manufactured goods to Europe, but
they do not appear to have done that. Almost all of Argentina’s exports in 1914 were
agricultural, which surely reﬂects the country’s comparative advantage and the large
shipping costs for manufactured goods. By contrast, America was an industrial
exporter in 1900, and goods from Chicago, like McCormick’s reapers, were
traveling the globe. Still, it seems likely that these sales tell us more about
technology than about transportation costs. In principle, reapers built in Buenos
Aires could have been shipped to Russia, just like those in Chicago. It is not obvious
that the costs would have been that much higher, if at all. The difference was that
Chicago was at the cutting edge of reaper technology, while Buenos Aires was not.
A quick look at Chicago’s industrial sectors gives us a sense of the city’s level of
technology. Table 2 lists the top ﬁve industries, by employment, for Chicago in
1910 and Buenos Aires in 1914. A few large industries dominated Chicago
manufacturing in the years before World War I. The largest sector was men’s
clothing production, which employed 38,000 people in 1909. Another 37,000 were
in foundry and machine shop products. 27,000 worked in meat-packing. There were
also 33,000 in printing and publishing. 12,000 people worked in lumber. 12,000
more workers made cars. 11,000 Chicagoans made furniture and refrigerator units.
The meat-packers were directly transforming the products of Chicago’s hinterland,
but the others were working in more advanced products.
Clothing was also Buenos Aires largest industrial sector in 1914, with 36,000
workers. Moreover, the capital/labor ratios were pretty similar in both cities: both
men’s clothing in Chicago and ‘‘dressing’’ (vestido y tocador) in Buenos Aires had
about 750 dollars per worker in capital, which suggests that both industries were
labor-intensive and using relatively similar technologies. In the clothing sector, the
level of horsepower per capita was actually higher in Buenos Aires than in Chicago.
The fact that the clothing manufacturers in Chicago were more productive
presumably reﬂects more about the available market, than anything about the state
of clothing production technology in the Windy City. Chicago’s clothing
manufacturers had particularly beneﬁted by the distribution networks in the

However, in other areas, there is much more evidence of Chicago’s technology
superiority. For example, Chicago had about 12 times more employment in car
production in 1910 than Buenos Aires did in 1914. Automobiles in that era were a
cutting-edge technology. Argentines would purchase plenty of cars in the teens and
20s, but the bulk of them were imported, often from the United States.
Chicago had 37,000 people in foundry and machine shop products relative to
16,000 people in Buenos Aires in metallurgy. However, in this case, the Americans
appear to have been far more industrially advanced using 55,000 units of
horsepower (or 1.1 per worker) as opposed to 8000 (or 0.5 per worker) in Buenos
Aires. The Chicago workers had 2400 dollars of capital per worker; the blacksmiths
in Buenos Aires had less than half that. These different levels of capital suggest that
the Argentines were following a much more primitive model of metal machine
production than their Chicago counterparts.
Chicago also appears to have been at the forefront of a number of technological
breakthroughs, beyond McCormick and his reaper. In the nineteenth and early
twentieth centuries, Chicago innovators created the skyscraper, the electric washing
machine, the zipper and a host of other signiﬁcant inventions. It is difﬁcult to ﬁnd
any comparable breakthroughs for Buenos Aires.
Evidence for signiﬁcant differences in the state of technology also appears in
many industrial histories. For example, Torcuato DiTella was a leading Argentina
industrialist over the ﬁrst half of the twentieth century. While DiTella’s ﬁrst success
came with a bread-kneading machine that he invented himself, many of his later
successes came from importing American technology. For example, in the 1920s, he
catered to Argentina’s growing population of drivers (many of whom were in
American cars), by providing a new gas pump through a licensing arrangement with
the American Wayne Gas Pump company. In the 1930s, he began making
refrigerators, ﬁrst licensing from Kelvinator and then Westinghouse.
Why was Chicago more technologically sophisticated than Buenos Aires a
century ago? There were surely many reasons, but human capital seems like a
particularly important explanatory variable. Education helped spread ideas in the
U.S. and gave engineers the background needed for more innovation. The
differences in schooling between the two countries help us to understand why
America had more developed industries a century ago.
3.4 Politics
The ﬁnal major difference between Buenos Aires and Chicago lies in the area of
politics. The Argentine Constitution of 1853 has a large number of similarities to the
U.S. Constitution, which is not entirely coincidental, as the Argentines looked, in
part, to the U.S. model. As in the U.S., there are three branches of government, and
a bi-cameral legislature. The legislature included both a directly elected house, the
Chamber of Deputies, and an indirectly elected legislature, the Senate. Moreover,
between 1862 and 1930, Argentina maintained a reasonable amount of political
Argentina and the United States differed for at least some of that post-Rosas time
period. First, until 1912, Argentinean suffrage was far more restricted than that of
the United States. For example, after 1850, no U.S. state had property rights
requirements for voting. By 1860, any of the old tax requirements had also
disappeared. Of course, some American states did impose ‘‘literacy’’ qualiﬁcations,
often in an attempt to exclude African-Americans from voting, but aside from
African-Americans in southern states, essentially all American men could vote by
the Civil War.
By contrast, universal male suffrage did not appear in Argentina until 1912. For
example, as late as 1896, Banerjee et al. (2006) estimate that only 1.6% of
Argentina’s population voted, in part because of literacy and wealth requirements.
Alonso (1993) documents that 1.8% of the city’s population, or less than 4% of the
male population, voted in the 1896 election. By contrast, more than 40% of Illinois’
male population voted in the 1896 U.S. Presidential election, which suggests a far
more open democracy in Chicago than Argentina.
In addition to the limits on suffrage, the Argentinean electoral system did not
have a secret ballot. Instead, the voto cantado (‘‘sung ballot’’)—in which each voter
would come to the electoral precinct and loudly declare his preferred candidate,
upon which the electoral authority would write it down—guaranteed that a local
caudillo could pressure voters into supporting the candidate of his choosing.
Ironically, the allegedly liberal arguments often advanced by urban interests against
the extension of the franchise—the idea that rural oligarchs would just manipulate
their workers’ votes—found their match in the allegedly enlightened arguments of
the landed oligarchy against the secret ballot, as they argued that it would deprive
ignorant workers from the ‘‘healthy inﬂuence’’ of their landlords (Sampay 1974).
Argentina’s voting rules evolved over the period 1890–1910 (Alonso, 1993), and
the country moved to universal manhood suffrage and the secret ballot in 1912, with
´
˜
the passage of the Saenz Pena law. Engerman et al. (2000) document that voter
participation increased to 9% (or 18% of the male population) in the 1916 election
and 12.8% (or 25% of the male population) in the 1928. By 1920, both Chicago and
Buenos Aires had mass democracy, but that democracy was much younger in
Argentina. As (at least some) political institutions take time to mature, the novelty
of that democracy in Argentina may have added to its weakness.
Not only were electoral rules different between the two cities until 1912,
electoral practices were as well. It is unclear if Buenos Aires or Chicago had more
electoral corruption, as allegations of voter abuse ﬂew in both places. Textbooks on
Argentinean history regularly describe the corruption of nineteenth century politics.
The voto cantado system, in particular, gave tremendous power to the electoral
judges who were in charge of writing down the vote announced by each voter and
invited widespread corruption on their part. For example, Rock (1987) writes that
‘‘only a small fraction of the nominally enfranchised population voted in elections,
which local bosses regulated by manipulating the electoral roles or by simple
bribery and intimidation.’’
However, American politics during the Gilded Age was hardly a model of
most famous of all Gilded Age political stories. As late as 1960, rumors alleged that
Mayor Daley had manufactured vast numbers of votes for John F. Kennedy in
Chicago. Since electoral fraud is hard to measure, and allegations of fraud abound in
both places, it would be hard to claim any clear ranking between the two cities in
that area.
In any event, it is certainly true that mass violence was far more regular in
Argentina than in the U.S., at least after the bloodbath of the Civil War. It is clear
that elections in Chicago were not leading to major armed outbreaks. America, of
course, did have one election which ended up in open warfare, but after 1865
disagreements over outcomes did not lead to large-scale battles. Not so in
Argentina.
Buenos Aires was no stranger to political conﬂict during the late nineteenth
century and early twentieth century. In 1880, 1890, 1893 and 1905, Argentina
experienced major uprisings; three of those started in Buenos Aires, and the fourth
also reached it. The 1880 uprising was associated with the election of Julio Roca as
President of Argentina. Roca was seen as favoring nationalization over decentralization and he defeated Carlos Tejedor, a favorite in Buenos Aires. After the
electoral defeat, 10,000 Buenos Aires residents rose up and a bloody battle ensued
with 3000 casualties. Roca secured the presidency, and the centralization of
Argentina, only by suppressing the revolt.
After that point, the Republica Conservadora (‘‘Conservative Republic’’) that
´
lasted between 1880 and 1916, under the oligarchic rule of the so-called Generacion
´
del’80 (‘‘Year’80 Generation’’), faced constant pressure from the ‘‘Radical’’
opposition. This often spilled into armed conﬂict, such as in 1890, 1893 and 1905.
The 1890 revolution was associated with the somewhat leftist Civic Union group,
which was actually led by Mitre himself, and it aimed to topple the President Miguel
Celman. In that, the uprising succeeded and led to the presidency of Carlos
Pellegrini, who was a general opposing the revolt. In 1893, an uprising led by the
Radical Civic Union, an offshoot of the Civic Union, started in the Santa Fe region
of Argentina, but also spilled over into the capital city. In 1905, the Radical Civic
Union led another revolt in Buenos Aires, which was unsuccessful. In addition, the
anarchist- and socialist-inﬂuenced labor movement brought about by European
immigrants contributed to the political turmoil with massive strikes such as the
‘‘tenants’ strike’’ of 1907 and the ‘‘Red Week’’ of 1909.
The coup of 1930, which would oust President Yrigoyen, is often seen as a
turning point in Argentine politics, where democracy was replaced with military
rule. However, we have seen that this coup was hardly without precedent. Four
times between 1880 and 1905, revolts started or reaching Buenos Aires shook the
country and often achieved a fair amount of success. This suggests a degree of
instability in Buenos Aires that was much more extreme than in Chicago.
Chicago did have uprisings, most notably the Haymarket Riot of 1886 and the
Chicago Race Riot of 1919. The labor union movement also made its presence felt,
of course, as illustrated by the Haymarket episode, the ‘‘Teamsters’ strike’’ of 1905
and the ‘‘Garment strike’’ of 1910, all of which ended with many killed and injured
Buenos Aires than in Chicago, by the 1920s, after Prohibition, the picture is
essentially reversed.
While both Chicago and Buenos Aires had uprisings, their consequences were
vastly disparate. If the immediate consequences of the Haymarket riot were the
controversial execution of seven anarchists and a boost to May Day commemorations around the world, the Buenos Aires events had far more direct consequences
for the Argentinean political system. The Revolution of the Park, in 1890, while
defeated by government forces, still led to the fall of President Celman. The 1893
Revolution also took over the Casa Rosada before being defeated. In fact, the
´
˜
consensus interpretation of the Saenz Pena law among historians describes it as
largely motivated by the rising tension and the pressure exerted by the Radical
opposition, galvanized by the battle cry of the secret ballot and universal suffrage,
and by the labor movement. As a result of the electoral reform, the Conservative
Republic also met its demise in 1916, when the Radical Yrigoyen won the
presidency in the ﬁrst election under the new rules.
What can explain these different consequences? The relative immaturity of the
Argentine democracy certainly played a part, but it is also the case that the location
of Buenos Aires at the very heart of the country’s politics, as the all-important
˜
capital city in which by 1914 more than one in six Argentineans lived, made Porteno
turmoil more consequential. In fact, Argentina still is one of the countries with the
highest concentration of population around the capital city in the whole world—it
has the highest concentration among countries with large territories—using the
measure developed in Campante and Do (2010).
The centrality of Buenos Aires, of course, is not simply related to its designation
as the capital city. From the very early years of the independent Republic, the city’s
enormous weight in terms of population and economic activity, which was
engendered by its position as the gateway to the hinterland and by the low labor
intensity of the dominant cattle-raising activity, posed a constant challenge to the
Argentinean federal system. This is illustrated by the perennial tension between the
Province of Buenos Aires—which was still ﬁghting the idea of joining the Union, in
the battleﬁeld, as late as 1862—and the other provinces, which culminated in the
federalization of the city of Buenos Aires in 1880. Chicago, in contrast, was a
relative latecomer to the Union, which the state of Illinois joined more than 40 years
after independence—and Chicago, of course, is not even the capital of that state.
In any event, the fact is that the 1890 Revolution, for instance, started in the
Artillery Park, located a half-mile from the Casa Rosada. The Haymarket riot, in
contrast, took place some 700 miles away from the White House. For this reason, it
is very likely that the political and social instability that brewed in the similar
environments of Chicago and Buenos Aires, both of which were undergoing rapid
transformation, had much more detrimental consequences for Argentina in terms of
the consolidation of its democracy.
There is a strong connection between urban concentration in and around a
primate capital and political instability (Ades and Glaeser 1995; Campante et al.
2016), which reﬂects causality running in both directions. For at least 2500 years,
was ended by another urban coup. The history of Europe’s great medieval cities,
like Bruges, is replete with organized opposition to aristocratic rules. France’s
political instability in the nineteenth century owes much to the power of Parisian
mobs to topple governments.
The fundamental ingredient in a successful revolt is scale: isolated activists can
do little to challenge a government. Urban density makes it easier to form
connections, which can create a sufﬁciently large uprising. Riots are, after all, a
primarily urban phenomenon (DiPasquale and Glaeser 1997). The political
importance, however, of urban riots depends on their proximity to power (Campante
et al. 2016). That explains why uprisings in Buenos Aires were so much more
important than those in Chicago.
The political power of urban mobs can lead to two political responses. The ﬁrst is
to placate the mob with public handouts and services (Campante et al. 2016).
Classical Rome’s vast bread doles, for example, can be understood as an attempt to
cool the mobs organized by the Gracchus and others. The general tendency of
developing countries to target public services to the capital is a more modern
example of this phenomenon. Of course, placating urban unrest has the effect of
then further expanding the size of the capital city. For this reason, the connection
between political instability and capital size is two-sided. A large capital appears to
create instability, and instability means that services ﬂow to the capital, which
attracts migrants and further increases its size.
In some cases, political leaders respond to the threat created by urban unrest by
moving their capital far away from the city (Campante et al. 2016). When Peter the
Great moved his capital to St. Petersburg he was protecting his regime from the
inﬂuence of Muscovites. Likewise, America’s founders chose to create a new
capital on the Potomac, in part to reduce the inﬂuence of people in New York and
Philadelphia (America’s ﬁrst capitals). America’s largest riot, the 1863 New York
City draft riot, could have had a much larger inﬂuence on history if New York,
rather than Washington, had been the capital of the U.S.
In light of these facts, we are led to conclude that the large, primate capital of
Argentina might have played a major role in the nation’s twentieth century political
problems.

4 Did those differences matter?
We have argued that, despite the enormous similarities between Chicago and
Buenos Aires, there were substantial differences in income, education, industrial
development and political institutions. The main question that remains is the extent
to which each one of those differences might be able to account for the different
paths of Buenos Aires and Chicago, and more broadly those of Argentina and the
U.S., in the twentieth century. In principle, any one of those differences could have
played a role. A ‘‘big push’’ theory of growth (e.g. Rosenstein-Rodan 1943; Murphy
et al. 1989) might suggest that higher levels of income could have put the U.S. on a
that Buenos Aires was far less industrial than Chicago, and far more dependent on
natural resources, set the stage for the declines of the 1930s, when the price of
natural resources plummeted. The political differences of Buenos Aires might have
played a role in explaining the political traumas that Argentina experienced over the
twentieth century.
A system with two countries and four potential explanatory variables is, of
course, overdetermined. The only way to evaluate the relative importance of these
four factors is to bring in other countries. We will do this directly, by running a set
of cross-national regressions, while drawing on the long literature on the
determinants of differences in country-level prosperity, such as Hall and Jones
(1999). Although the limitations of cross-country regressions are well known, they
can nevertheless provide us with a benchmark quantitative assessment of our
candidate explanations.
We start from the premise that there is a link between relevant outcomes such as
income today and variables in the early twentieth century, and that we can look at
100-year regressions at the cross-country level to estimate the impact that the latter
have on the former. We then multiply these estimated coefﬁcients by the differences
in initial conditions between the U.S. and Argentina, to get a sense of the amount of
today’s differences that can be explained by the different initial conditions in this
speciﬁc comparison. Essentially, we are assuming a model of the following form:
X
YToday;j ¼
bi Xi;1900;j þ ej ;
ð1Þ
i

where YToday;j is country j’s outcome today, bi is the coefﬁcient on explanatory
variable i, Xi;1900;j is the value of explanatory variable i in country j in 1900 and ej is
a country-speciﬁc error term. This estimating equation then suggests that the differences in outcomes between Argentina and the U.S. today can be understood as
follows:
X
YToday;US À YToday;Argentina ¼
bi ðXi;1900;US À Xi;1900;Argentina Þ þ eUS À eArgentina :
i

ð2Þ
The ratio

bi ðXi;1900;US ÀXi;1900;Argentina Þ
YToday;US ÀYToday;Argentina

is the share of the current differences between

Argentina and the U.S. that can be explained by variable i. The cross-country
regressions will furnish our estimates of the coefﬁcients bi .
Our primary outcome variable is the logarithm of per capita GDP in 2000,
calculated using purchasing power parity and taken from the Maddison (2008) data
set. Since GDP is typically measured at the country, not city level, we will be using
national GDP measures and national characteristics a century ago. Using this
variable, the difference in log of GDP per capita between the U.S. and Argentina is
1.2, which means that American incomes were 230% higher than those in Argentina
in 2000. This is, of course, much larger than the 48% difference shown in 1900 GDP
much of the work on Argentina has emphasized the interaction of political and
economic distress (e.g. della Paolera and Gallo 2003). We focus on the democracy
score of the country, as measured by the ‘‘Polity 2’’ variable from the Polity IV data
set, averaged between 1970 and 2000. This measure subtracts a 0-to-10 ‘‘Autocracy’’ score from a 0-to-10 ‘‘Democracy’’ score (both of which constitute indices of
institutional features), resulting in values ranging from - 10 to 10. We use a longrun political average, because democracy measures vary substantially from year to
year. Moreover, Argentina’s current political environment is far more stable than
even its recent past, and looking only at the most recent data would understate the
extent of the country’s political turbulence. (For the period average, Argentina
scores 2.06, while the U.S. scores 10.) We will look at GDP ﬁrst, then politics, and
then ask whether controlling for current politics helps us to understand the
differences in GDP.
Our key explanatory variables are per capita GDP in 1900 [from Maddison
(2008)], which is available for 37 countries, and measures of school enrollment for
the same year (from Banks). Our school variable adds together the enrollment rates
for primary, secondary and university education. (The most important variable is
primary education, and results are similar if we use that variable alone.) We have 36
countries with this variable. Our third variable is the share of manufacturing in total
output in the early twentieth century, which we obtain from multiple sources
(Milward and Saul 1977; Bulmer-Thomas 1994; Engerman and Sokoloff 2000;
Urquhart 1993). (The actual year varies by country, between 1899 and 1920; most
come from around 1913.) This variable captures the degree of industrialization a
century ago, but it is only available for 16 countries. Finally, we use the average of
the Polity 2 variable between 1870 and 1900 to measure institutional development.
As these variables are often quite collinear, and as they are available for different
subsamples of countries, we begin by examining the univariate relationship between
these explanatory variables and the logarithm of per capita GDP in 2000.
Regression (1) in Table 3 shows the relationship between GDP in 1900 and GDP
today. The lagged variable explains 65% of the variation in current GDP across the
37 countries. Essentially, the elasticity is one, meaning that if a country was 10%
richer than another in 1900, then it is 10% richer today.
Figure 5 shows the relationship between income in 1900 and income today. The
relationship certainly is tight, but Argentina is an outlier, falling substantially below
the regression line. If we were to accept the coefﬁcient of 1.01 on log GDP per
capita in 1900, then initial income levels would only predict a 0.4 log point
difference today. This translates into a difference of about 49%, which is just about
one-ﬁfth of the total difference in incomes between Argentina and the U.S.
In the second regression, we look at the connection between our schooling
variable and GDP today. The R-squared rises to 70%, and as the share of the
population attending school increases by 5%, then GDP today increases by 0.7 log
points. This is about doubling. This captures the enormously strong connection that
schooling in the past appears to have with current income levels (as in Glaeser et al.

somewhat beneath it.
Can the difference in schooling explain current income levels? We will return to
this question later, when we have controlled for other variables, but a simple thought
experiment using the univariate coefﬁcient suggests that power of education. The

Buenos Aires may have had comparable enrollment rates to Chicago, outside the
city education levels were far lower than in the U.S. Multiplying 0.12 by the
estimated coefﬁcient of 14.4 suggests a current income difference of 1.80 log points,
which is actually substantially larger than the realized income difference. While this
fact tells us nothing about whether schooling is actually determining the gap or
whether it is just proxying for something else, the raw coefﬁcient suggests that the
cross-country relationship in income suggested by 1900 schooling levels can
account for the current differences between Argentina and the U.S.
Our third regression looks at the share of manufacturing in output around 1913.
We only have 16 observations, but again, the relationship with current income is
positive and signiﬁcant. As in the case of income, however, even the univariate
regression does not suggest that this variable is powerful enough to explain more
than a quarter of the current difference between the U.S. and Argentina.
Finally, we look at the correlation between political instability in the late
nineteenth century and GDP today. The explanatory power of this variable is much
weaker than the other variables. As Fig. 7 shows, there are plenty of once
unstable countries that are now quite prosperous. Argentina may have been less
stable than the U.S., but it was more stable and democratic than many European
countries which are now far more prosperous. Still, the correlation between
nineteenth century instability and wealth today might explain something of the
current differences between Argentine and U.S. wealth. Using the univariate
coefﬁcient, we ﬁnd that the differences in the historical politics measures would
predict a 0.7 log point difference in incomes today, which is more than half of the
total income differences.

have a chance at explaining signiﬁcant amounts of the differences in income
between the U.S. and Argentina. The other variables appear less important. To sort
out the relative importance of these different variables, we now turn to multivariate
regressions. In regression (5), we include both GDP and schooling as control
variables. The coefﬁcient on GDP drops by almost 75% and becomes statistically
indistinguishable from zero; the coefﬁcient on schooling retains statistical
signiﬁcance but drops by one-half. The bulk of this drop does not come from
controlling for income, but rather from restricting the sample size. We do not have
GDP ﬁgures in 1900 for many poorer countries, especially in Latin America; as a
result, the sample becomes wealthier and the coefﬁcient (which is smaller across
richer countries) becomes smaller.
In regression (6), we control for manufacturing and schooling. When we control
for schooling, the coefﬁcient on manufacturing is very small, and just borderline
signiﬁcant at the 10% level. The coefﬁcient on the schooling variable is 7.4. When
we include GDP in the regression (not shown), controlling for manufacturing drives
the coefﬁcient on GDP in 1900 essentially to zero; the coefﬁcients on the other two
variables remain largely unaffected, but the signiﬁcance of manufacturing is
removed. In regression (7), we control for politics as well as the schooling variable.
In this case, politics becomes insigniﬁcant, and the coefﬁcient on schooling is
essentially the same as in the univariate case.
These results strengthen the case for the central role played by differences in
schooling, but we still need to investigate what happens when the full set of
variables is simultaneously included. This is what we do in regression (8) (with the
exception of manufacturing, which causes our sample to shrink too much). With all
three variables, schooling remains signiﬁcant with a coefﬁcient of 7.6. The other
two variables are not. We take away from these regressions the view that no
variable, other than schooling in 1900, has a reliable correlation with GDP in 2000.
The coefﬁcient on schooling ranges from 7.5 to 14.5.
We have already shown that if the schooling coefﬁcient is 14.5 it can more than
explain the current differences between Argentina and the U.S. How much of those
differences can schooling in 1900 predict if the coefﬁcient is smaller? For example,
if the coefﬁcient is 10, then the differences in schooling levels in 1900 would predict
a 1.2 log point difference in current incomes, which is exactly the difference in
2000. If the coefﬁcient is 7.5, then the schooling difference can explain 75% of the
current income differences. As such, human capital in 1900 seems to predict the
lion’s share of the difference in current incomes.
But why would historical human capital levels predict such large income
differences? One obvious explanation is that human capital in 1900 predicts human
capital today and that current human capital differences explain the gap between the
U.S. and Argentina. It is certainly true that schooling in 1900 is strongly correlated
with schooling today: the correlation coefﬁcient between our enrollment data and
total years of schooling in 2000 taken from Barro-Lee (2000) is 85%.
Moreover, years of schooling today certainly strongly predict income levels. A
univariate regression of log of GDP on total years of schooling in 2000 ﬁnds a
univariate coefﬁcient literally suggests that current schooling differences can
explain 98% of the current GDP gap between the U.S. and Argentina.
But what does this univariate coefﬁcient mean? Our cross-country coefﬁcient
certainly implies a much higher effect than estimates from individual-level studies,
where an extra year of schooling rarely increases wages by more than 10 or at most
15% (e.g. Ashenfelter and Krueger 1994; Card 1999). If that lower range of
coefﬁcients represented the link between education and productivity, then higher
education levels in the U.S. can explain less than one-third of the difference in
incomes between Argentina and the U.S.
How can we reconcile the gap between individual-level estimates of human
capital effects and country-level estimates of human capital effects? One view is
that the larger coefﬁcients at the national level represent human capital spillovers.
Living in a country with more skilled individuals may make everyone more
productive, perhaps because skilled workers are responsible for determining the
level of technology in a given country. However, cross-metropolitan area studies of
human capital spillovers generate an estimate that is positive, but far too small to
account for the size of the cross-country coefﬁcient (Rauch 1993; Acemoglu and
Angrist 2000).
One explanation for the difference between the cross-city estimates and the crosscountry estimates is that—as suggested by Glaeser et al. 2007), building on the
famous Lipset (1959) hypothesis—schooling is responsible for political outcomes.
In particular, stable democratic institutions tend to be predicated on the level of
schooling of the citizenry. According to this view, Argentina’s problematic political
history during the twentieth century has its roots in the relatively lower human
capital levels of the country in 1900.2 To test this hypothesis, in Table 4, we
reproduce the exercise from Table 3, but now with political stability between 1970
and 2000 as our dependent variable.
The ﬁrst four regressions repeat the univariate relationships shown in Table 3. As
before, all of these variables predict the outcome variable. Schooling has the
strongest correlation with democracy during the late twentieth century, but the other
variables also predict democratic stability. In the ﬁfth regression, we include all of
the variables—again with the exception of manufacturing, which depletes too much
of the sample. In this case, schooling continues to predict democracy, and the
coefﬁcient is essentially unchanged. None of the other variables remain statistically
signiﬁcant.
Can the schooling differences between Argentina and the U.S. explain the
instability of late twentieth century Argentina, in a quantitative sense? The
difference in the two outcome variables is 7.94. The estimated coefﬁcient on
schooling is approximately 52. Multiplying 52 by the schooling difference in 1900

The relatively low levels of human and physical capital might have inﬂuenced political instability in
Argentina through yet another channel. Campante and Chor (2012) show evidence that, in countries that
are relatively land-abundant, individual schooling tends to be more strongly associated with political
activity, particularly for ‘‘conﬂictual’’ modes of activity such as demonstrations. This suggests that, for
the case of Argentina, its dearth of physical and human capital relative to the U.S. meant that the

yields an estimate of 6.24, which is 79% of the observed instability difference.
While the schooling differences cannot explain all of the differences in democracy,
they can certainly go most of the way.
Our ﬁnal exercise is to see whether the connection between education and
democracy can explain why schooling in 1900 is so correlated with incomes today.
Going back to the speciﬁcation from Table 3, we now include the twentieth century
politics variable in a regression that also includes schooling in 1900. Including this
variable causes the coefﬁcient on schooling to decrease by more than a third,
relative to the univariate regression, but the coefﬁcient remains 8.87, which is still
quite high. If we include both democracy today and GDP in 1900 as controls, then
the coefﬁcient on schooling in 1900 falls to 2.7 and is no longer signiﬁcantly
different from zero, as shown in regression (9). We interpret these regressions as
suggesting that much of the impact of relatively low levels of schooling in
Argentina went through political channels.
Whatever remains of the schooling effect may work either through unmeasured
political channels, or direct human capital effects, or through better technology.
Hopefully, further work will better help us to understand the strong connection
between historical schooling and current GDP in a broader context. In our speciﬁc
case, however, it does seem to be true that Argentina’s collapse, relative to the U.S.,
had much to do with lower education levels.

5 Conclusion
There were many similarities between the historical trajectories of Chicago and
Buenos Aires. Both cities were conduits for natural wealth coming from the
American hinterland to the markets of the east. Both cities dealt in the same
products, ﬁrst animals and then grain. Both cities grew spectacularly and were
cities. Chicago was wealthier and better educated. Its industries were more
advanced and more capital intensive. Its political system was more stable, and its
instability was less consequential. All told, Buenos Aires looks more like a place
that became rich because of a boom in natural resources. Chicago used those natural
resources and then transitioned into becoming a more modern industrial place, with
substantially greater levels of physical and human capital.
The gap in industrial development and human capital then set the stage for the
twentieth century. Across countries, schooling in 1900 strongly predicts success
today, partially because less schooled places have had far worse political outcomes.
America’s greater level of human capital in 1900 surely deserves much credit for its
track record of twentieth century political stability. In this regard, the effects of the
lower levels of human capital in Buenos Aires were in turn magniﬁed by its
overwhelming political importance within Argentina. All in all, the divergence
between Chicago and Buenos Aires reﬂects the fact that Buenos Aires in 1900 had
wealth levels that were far higher than its actual level of human and physical capital
accumulation.
From a slightly broader perspective, particularly within the context of Latin
America, this conclusion sounds somewhat dispiriting. After all, by the standards of
the region, Argentina did invest early and heavily in human capital accumulation
and achieved a stage of near-universal literacy and enrollment way before most of
its neighbors—many of which are still considerably off that mark. Still, it seems that
the human capital lag it displayed in comparison with the US or Western Europe,
even in its heyday, ended up trapping the country with relatively immature political
institutions. This fragility was in turn made more acute by the geographical
concentration of population and economic activity around Buenos Aires and
eventually plunged the country into a cycle of instability from which its economic
performance could not escape unscathed. President Sarmiento seemed to have his
ﬁnger on the right issue when he stated that ‘‘all problems are problems of
education’’, but for Argentina we might add that this recognition was not enough.

Yet another tale of two cities: Buenos Aires
and Chicago

Abstract Buenos Aires and Chicago grew during the nineteenth century for
remarkably similar reasons. Both cities were conduits for moving meat and grain
from fertile hinterlands to eastern markets. However, despite their initial similarities, Chicago was vastly more prosperous for most of the twentieth century. Can the
differences between the cities after 1930 be explained by differences in the cities
before that date? We highlight four major differences between Buenos Aires and
Chicago in 1914. Chicago was slightly richer, and signiﬁcantly better educated.
Chicago was more industrially developed, with about 2.25 times more capital per
worker. Finally, Chicago’s political situation was far more stable and it was not a
political capital. Human capital seems to explain the lion’s share of the divergent
path of the two cities and their countries, both because of its direct effect and
because of the connection between education and political instability.

Both Buenos Aires and Chicago grew enormously over the late nineteenth century
as nodes of a transportation network that brought the produce of the New World’s
rich, but relatively unpopulated, hinterlands to the tables of the world. (Figure 1
shows the parallel population growth of both places.) In the early 1900s, the two
cities dominated meat-packing in the Americas and were great centers of grain
shipments. About one-half of the populations of both cities were immigrants, who
had come to take advantage of high wages in these urban areas. Both cities were
governed by functioning but imperfect democracies, and both were famous for their
corruption.
Over the course of the twentieth century, the paths of the two cities have, of
course, signiﬁcantly diverged, just as the paths of Argentina and the U.S. have
diverged. Buenos Aires has had faster population growth, but Chicago has become
much richer and has also been generally free of the regime-changing political
uprisings that have challenged the Argentine capital.1 In this paper, we ask whether
differences between the cities at the start of the twentieth century can help us to
make sense of their divergent paths since then.
On a functional level, the cities in 1900s appear quite similar. In both cases, rail
lines brought wheat and beef into the port. From there, the beef was processed and
the produce shipped east. The stockyards that carve up cattle and pigs are big
employers in both places. Refrigeration signiﬁcantly aids the exports of both cities.
By 1910, the income gap between the two cities had closed to the point where real
wages were about 70% higher in Chicago, which is substantially less than the gap
was in 1890 or today.
Yet there were signiﬁcant differences in Chicago and Buenos Aires even in 1910,
beyond that income gap. First, the education levels of Chicago residents seem to
have been much higher. This difference does not reﬂect educational enrollments,
which seem broadly similar after 1884 Argentine education reform. Instead, the
adults coming into Buenos Aires seem to have been much less educated than those
coming into Chicago. The main reason for this difference is that rural–urban
migrants in the U.S. were much better educated, reﬂecting the strength of the
American common school movement in the early nineteenth century. Chicago also
had more German immigrants, who were relatively well educated, while Buenos
Aires disproportionately attracted immigrants from the less well-educated countries
of Spain and Italy.
Second, Chicago moved much more quickly towards being an industrial producer
as well as a transformer of raw commodities. Capital per worker appears to have
been about 2.44 times higher in Chicago than in Buenos Aires in 1914. Value added
per worker appears to have been 2.25 times higher in Chicago, which can readily
explain the 70% wage gap. Chicago’s production of goods was, to a large extent,
oriented towards providing goods for the prosperous Midwestern hinterland. The

The events at the 1968 Democratic Convention were as close as Chicago ever came to toppling a
government. While many observers link the Chicago riots with Richard Nixon’s success in the election, it
remains true that Nixon came to power through an electoral process that is quite different from the paths

market for Buenos Aires-made manufactured goods was much smaller, because the
Argentine farmers were much poorer. Moreover, Chicago had a long track record of
innovation, and in many areas, such as mechanical reapers, it was on the forefront of
new technologies. By contrast, Argentina was an importer of technological ideas
through much of the twentieth century. Chicago’s higher human capital levels may
help explain why Chicago was more technologically developed, but in any event, by
1930, Chicago is essentially an industrial town, while Buenos Aires is still focused
on raw food production and commerce.
Last but not least, political forces in Buenos Aires and Chicago were different.
While Chicago had universal manhood suffrage since the Civil War, Buenos Aires
had a much more limited electoral base until 1914. More importantly, Buenos Aires
is Argentina’s capital while Chicago is not the capital of the U.S. The combination
of commerce and politics in Buenos Aires means that uprisings in the city have the
ability to topple national governments. Comparable uprisings in Chicago, such as
the Haymarket riot, were only of local concern. The concentration of population in
Buenos Aires seems to have made the country less politically stable.
In the fourth section of this paper, we attempt to assess the relative importance of
these difference factors by using cross-national evidence. Inevitably; this pulls us
away from a city-level focus to a more national perspective. We examine the ability
of pre-World War I variables, including income, industrialization, education,
urbanization and political instability to explain cross-section income variation
today. All of these variables are strongly correlated with current per capita GDP
levels, but measures of schooling in 1900 have the strongest connection to modern
mechanical decomposition, explain almost all of the differences in current income
levels.
But why is the connection between historical education levels and current income
so tight? The direct effect of education on earnings can explain only a small portion
of the link. Education, however, is also correlated with political outcomes.
Stable democracies are much rarer in less well-educated countries (Glaeser et al.
2007). Lower levels of education in Argentina can help us to understand that
nation’s twentieth century political problems. However, education also seems to
have a strong direct impact on national income levels, which can, perhaps be
understood as stemming from the connection between area-level human capital and
the state of technological development.

2 Chicago del Plata; Buenos Aires on Lake Michigan
We begin by stressing the profound similarities between the economic models of
Chicago and Buenos Aires in the nineteenth century. As late as 1880, 72% of the
U.S. population was rural. The great wealth of the country came from its vast
expanses of fertile land. No area was more fertile than the hinterland of Chicago:
Illinois and Iowa. The rich black soil of America’s Corn Belt yielded an average of
39 bushels per acre in 1880, about 50% more than the older corn producing areas of
Kentucky. That higher productivity explains why Chicago passed Cincinnati as
America’s pig-producing polis.
America’s vast hinterland was enormously rich, but at the start of the nineteenth
century that land was virtually inaccessible. It cost as much to ship goods 32 miles
over land as it did to ship them across the ocean. Over the course of the nineteenth
century, Americans built a transportation network that managed to move
agricultural produce far more cheaply over space. Cities, like Chicago and
Cincinnati, were nodes on that transportation network. Typically, large cities
formed in places where goods needed to move from one form of transport to
another.
The growth of Chicago depended on two canals. The ﬁrst canal, the Erie,
connected the great lakes to the Hudson River, and through it the city of Chicago
was able to ship by water all the way to New York and the outside world. The
second canal was the Illinois and Michigan canal, which connected the Chicago
River to the Mississippi River system. Chicago’s ﬁrst boom decades, the 1830s,
coincided with speculation related to the completion of the canal. Those two canals
situated Chicago as the lynchpin of a watery arc that ran from New Orleans to New
York.
As it turned out, railroads became even more important in connecting Chicago to
the west. Starting in 1848, the Chicago and Galena railroad connected the city
westward. While initially intended to move lead, the rail connected to Iowa and
became a conduit for agricultural produce, particularly pigs. Corn is an enormously
calorie-intensive crop, but it is relatively expensive to ship. Hence corn was
Typically, mankind has tended to be more interested in salted pig products
(bacon, sausage, ham) than in salted beef products. For that reason, in the middle
nineteenth century, pigs were slaughtered in Chicago before their movement east,
while cows were shipped live. One great transport innovation in nineteenth century
Chicago was the four-season refrigerated rail car, used by Gustavus Swift. (His
engineer’s brilliant insight was to put the ice on top of the meat so it dripped down.)
After Swift began using refrigerated cars, Chicago increasingly shipped prepared
beef, instead of cattle on the hoof, as well as prepared pigs.
The ﬁnal element in Chicago’s agricultural shipping empire was its increasing
role as a center for grain shipments. Wheat has less value per ton than pork or beef,
and as a result high shipping costs in the middle nineteenthth century meant that
wheat typically traveled short distances. Rochester, New York, for example was
America’s ﬂour city in its early years, specializing in milling grain on its way to
New York City. As transportation costs fell, and as hard spring wheat made the cold
areas north of Chicago more productive, wheat increasingly came east from the old
northwest. Chicago, as the Midwest’s premier transport center, became a conduit for
shipping grain as well as shipping beef and pork.
Buenos Aires’ evolution in the nineteenthth century is broadly similar to that of
Chicago. The similarities start with the fact that what turned Buenos Aires into a
major commercial hub was its exceptionally fertile hinterland, rather than an
exceptionally located port (at least when compared to possible competitors such as
Montevideo). The developments in terms of the accessibility of this hinterland to the
main networks of international trade were once again the key in determining the
patterns followed by the city’s evolution. In 1850, transportation across the Atlantic
was slow and expensive, dependent on sailing ships. Argentina, therefore,
specialized in exporting products that were extremely durable, such as hides and
tallow. In the 1840s, Buenos Aires was exporting more than 2 million hides per year
and 10,000 tons of tallow (Brown 1976). Wool was also a major export. Notably,
these were the same products being produced in the region around Los Angeles
around the same time and for the same reason. Distant places with abundant land
were best used to produce goods that could last for months during a long sea
voyage.
Over the course of the nineteenthth century, Argentina moved to higher value
agricultural products, ﬁrst meat and then grain. In the middle years of the
nineteenthth century, Argentina was further away from European markets and had a
much higher ratio of land to population than the U.S. For example, in 1880,
Argentina was composed of 2.7 million square kilometers and had around 2.5
million people. The U.S. had 8 million square kilometers of land and 50 million
people. The vast amounts of space in Argentina made herding relatively more
attractive than intensive agriculture. While Argentina actually imported breadstuffs
from Chile, in the mid-1870s, it had more than 45 million sheep and more than 5
million cattle. Since cattle and sheep complement open ranges more than pigs, beef
became the primary export item for Argentina. They were, of course, and still are
thousand tons per year during the 1850s). The market for salted beef, such as beef
jerky, was never particularly robust and this limited the growth of Argentine export
trade. Two big transport innovations, however, enabled Argentina to grow
dramatically as a meat exporter. First, starting in the 1840s, steam replaced sail
on the cross-Atlantic journeys, reducing travel times by as much as two-thirds (from
over 70 days to less than 25). Second, in 1875, refrigerated ships, or frigorıﬁcos,
´
made it possible to ship chilled beef and mutton. The impact of refrigeration was
even greater on Buenos Aires than it was in Chicago, because the distances between
Buenos Aires and London precluded the shipment of live cattle in large numbers
before the 1880s.
With the coming of the frigorıﬁcos, Buenos Aires became a large exporter of
´
frozen and chilled beef and mutton. During the early years of chilled transport,
mutton was actually a more important export than beef, because ‘‘mutton, unlike
beef, is not injured materially in quality, ﬂavor and appearance by the freezing and
thawing process,’’ (Hanson 1938, p. 84). By 1892, Argentina was exporting more
than a million sheep carcasses annually. Faster transportation was also making it
easier to export vast amounts of live cattle and sheep to the United Kingdom and
other European markets, and by the turn of the century, 500,000 live sheep and
100,000 live cattle were being exported annually from Argentina to the England.
The vast increase in the amount of chilled beef exported from Argentina, much of
it through Buenos Aires, actually occurred during the early years of the twentieth
century. Between 1900 and 1916, Argentina’s exports of frozen beef increased from
26,000 tons to 411,000 tons. About a third of those frozen carcasses were coming
through the port of Buenos Aires, which was growing as a center for slaughtering
and refrigeration, as well as shipping.
The ﬁnal step in the agricultural development of Argentina also mirrors the
changes in Chicago. Just as the decline in shipping costs made it more attractive to
ship wheat from the west to New York via Chicago, easier shipping costs made
wheat a more attractive export for Argentina. As late as the 1870s, Argentina was
exporting essentially no wheat. By 1904, the Argentines were exporting more than
two million tons of it per year.
The growth of the wheat trade was accompanied by a vast transformation on the
Pampas. Land that had been used as open range became used for intensive wheat
cultivation. By 1910, 10 million acres in the province of Buenos Aires were being
used to grow wheat. The population of Buenos Aires’ hinterland rose dramatically
as immigrants came to farm. In 30 years, Argentina moved from having essentially
no cereal production to becoming one of the world’s three largest grain exporters.
The roots of this transformation also lay in better transportation technologies.
Across the Atlantic, faster and faster steam ships made it cheaper to ship grain.
Starting in the 1850s, a rail network was created within Argentina, generally
supported by the government and mostly connecting Buenos Aires to places in the
hinterland. (In yet another interesting parallel, just as a New England-born shipping
magnate, John Murray Forbes, built some of the ﬁrst rails that connected Chicago, a
New England-born shipping magnate, William Wheelwright, built some of the ﬁrst
crucially, it made it less expensive to ship grain to the capital. While cattle and
sheep could walk on their own to the port, grain always needed to be shipped. As a
result, grain particularly beneﬁted from the improvements in rail.
In sum, like Chicago, Buenos Aires initial attraction was its harbor and
waterways—the River Plata was an avenue into the interior—located next to an
exceptionally fertile hinterland. The rail network, which centered at the capital, only
increased Buenos Aires’ place at the hub of Argentina’s internal transport network,
just as rail only increased Chicago’s importance in the Midwest. The comparison
did not escape contemporary observers, such as U.S. Trade Commissioner Herman
G. Brock, who noted that ‘‘like Chicago, [Buenos Aires] has all the resources of the
broad pampas at its doors and is the terminus of a dozen railways whose network of
transportation covers the Republic from north to south and east to west, all feeding
directly or indirectly into the capital’’ (Brock 1919, p. 13).
By 1910 both Chicago and Buenos Aires were ‘‘nature’s metropolises.’’ Both
cities had grown great as conduits that moved the wealth of American hinterlands to
more densely populated markets. In both cases, beef and wheat played a
disproportionate role in the commerce of the cities. In both cases, improved
shipping technologies, especially refrigeration, enabled the cities to grow.
Yet the twentieth century time paths of these places were quite different. By
population, Buenos Aires grew faster, but by most other measures of progress
Chicago dramatically passed its southern rival, just as the income gap between the
U.S. and Argentina widened. Is it possible to see, in the differences between the two
cities a century ago, the roots of their twentieth century divergence?

3 Four differences between Buenos Aires and Chicago in 1910
In this section, we discuss four major areas in which Buenos Aires and Chicago
differed a century ago. In the next section, we connect these differences to the
history of the cities and their countries since then.
3.1 Incomes
Income levels are the natural starting point for understanding what was similar and
different between the U.S. and Argentina, so we ﬁrst look at wage data for the two
countries (plus Great Britain and Italy) from 1870 to 1970 (data from Williamson
1995b) in Fig. 2a–c. (The wages are normalized so that the British wage in 1905
equals 100.) At the start of the time period, wages in the United States are more than
50% higher than wages either in Great Britain or Argentina. Wages in those places
are about the same and about double the wages in Italy.
Between 1870 and the early 1890s, Argentina experienced a remarkable 66%
increase in real wages. Argentina’s spectacular real wage increase was accompanied
by, and probably created by, the aforementioned improvements in shipping
technology that enabled Argentine mutton and beef to efﬁciently be shipped to

Evidence and Hypotheses’’

ship meat quickly and that seems to have greatly increased the marginal
productivity of labor.
Argentina was not alone in experiencing real wage increases during the late
nineteenth century. American wages increased by amount the same proportion, so
that in 1892 (a high water mark for Argentine wages), American wages remained
60% above those in Argentina. Wages in Argentina and Britain remained quite
similar and about double the wages in Italy, which sent many immigrants to the U.S.
and Argentina during this period. Spain, another exporter of people to Argentina,
also had wages that were about one-half of those in Argentina.
Of course, these aggregate wage series do not particularly tell us about similar
workers in the two cities. To make the scales somewhat more comparable, Fig. 3
shows monthly wages in Chicago from the U.S. Census in 1939 dollars. In Chicago,
these wages rose substantially over the 1880s and then remained remarkably static
in real terms from 1890 to 1920. Over this time period, of course, the size of
Chicago’s large force was increasing dramatically. The city expanded from 500,000
to 2.7 million. That vast inﬂux of labor surely played a major role in keeping wage
growth modest. The slower population growth over the 1920s, when America
substantially reduced the ﬂow of foreign immigrants, may explain rising real wages
during that decade.

use national industrial data. However, much of Argentina’s industry was in the
capital, so this should give us some sense about wage levels for manufacturing
workers in Buenos Aires. While there are many ups and downs, over the whole
period, Argentine industrial workers become steadily better paid, as shown in the
Williamson data. Throughout the entire period, however, the workers in Chicago
were earning more in real terms than the workers in Buenos Aires. During most of
the time, the wage gap was approximately 70%. At the start of the century, before
the great divergence, there was already a very substantial income gap between the
two cities.
Why were the workers in Chicago, many of whom were doing comparable
things, earning much more? Classical economics pushes us to consider wages as the
intersection of labor supply and labor demand. Labor demand, in turn, reﬂects the
marginal productivity of labor. The higher wages in Chicago, therefore, imply that
labor was more productive in that city. Why?
There are three primary hypotheses. First, the workers in Chicago had more skills
than the workers in Buenos Aires. We will treat this hypothesis in the next section,
where we document signiﬁcantly greater education levels in Chicago. This gap
surely explains some of the difference. However, evidence on wages and schooling
from within the U.S. makes it clear that education differences alone cannot explain
the gap.
A second hypothesis is that Buenos Aires and Chicago had different amounts of
capital, and greater capital levels in Chicago increased the productivity of workers
in that city. We will turn to that hypothesis later, when we address the industrial
mixes of the two cities. Chicago appears to have had about 2.44 times more capital
worker, which in a standard Cobb–Douglas production function might suggest that
wages would be 30% higher in Chicago. This can explain almost one-half of the
gap.
Finally, a third hypothesis is that Chicago ﬁrms were more productive, either
because of more advanced technologies or because of the greater distances between
Buenos Aires and European markets meant that Argentine products were worth less,
at their point of production. The American workers were often much closer to their
customers and this decreased one cost of reduction and thereby increased the
marginal productivity of labor.
The labor supply curve also gives us information about the reasons for and the
nature of wage disparity between Chicago and Buenos Aires. Both cities attracted
very signiﬁcant amounts of immigration between 1890 and 1910. The 1910 census
shows that 36% of Chicago’s white residents were foreign born, out of which 16%
were from Russia, 23% were from Germany, 17% were from Austria and 6% were
Italian. In Buenos Aires, the estimates from the Buenos Aires Statistical Annual
(Anuario Estadistico de la Ciudad de Buenos Aires 1925) indicate that the city’s
population increased by 140% over those two decades, and more than half of that
increase was due to immigration. As a result of this massive inﬂow, 50% of Buenos
Aires’ residents were foreign born in 1914. Buenos Aires’ immigrant population
was by then overwhelmingly Spanish and Italian, as can be gleaned from the
total foreign-born population of the country.
The fact that Italian immigrants were going in large numbers to both Buenos
Aires and Chicago is puzzling if the real wage differences are actually of the order
of 70%. Why would an Italian immigrant choose Buenos Aires over America
knowing that real wages are likely to be so much less? There are three possible
explanations for this phenomenon. First, it is possible that Buenos Aires offered
amenities, like a better climate and a different culture, that were missing in Chicago.
Second, the immigrants going to Chicago and Buenos Aires might have actually
been quite different. Third, the real wage differences might have been smaller than
they appear.
The ﬁrst hypothesis surely has some truth to it. The fact that Spaniards were
drawn to Buenos Aires, despite lower real wages, would not seem like that much of
a puzzle. After all, Argentina is a Spanish-speaking country with a Latin culture.
The attraction of Buenos Aires is understandable. Italians were also attracted to
Buenos Aires because of the similarity in languages (and culture) between Italy and
Spain.
There were also substantial differences in the populations going to the U.S. and
Argentina. For example, between 1884 and 1886, two-thirds of the Italian
immigrants coming to Argentina were from Northern Italy. During the same years,
85% of Italian immigrants coming to the U.S. were from the south. During later
periods, the differences narrowed: in the 1907–1909 period; the number of southern
Italian immigrants to Buenos Aires had soared, and 31% of the Italian immigrants
came from the north. Still, that number was much higher than in the U.S. where only
9% of Italian immigrants came from Northern Italy.
The somewhat different regional origins suggests that, at least during the earlier
periods, the U.S. had greater attraction for the southerners while Argentina had
greater attraction for the northerners. The Northerners were generally much more
skilled: only about 12% of the northerners were illiterate, while 54% of the
southerners were illiterate. One interpretation is that the Southerners went to
America, where industrial wages were higher. The northerners, however, saw
greater returns to going to Buenos Aires, which was notably lacking in more skilled
workers. (As we will see in the next section, Buenos Aires was, throughout most of
the period, a signiﬁcantly less well educated city than Chicago.) This suggests that
the overall pattern of higher wages in Chicago might mask heterogeneity in the
wage differentials for different skill proﬁles.
Finally, the pull that Buenos Aires had to many immigrants does suggest that real
wages might not have been quite as low as they seem relative to the U.S. The
economic question is how much of a real wage discount would immigrants have
been willing to accept to live in Buenos Aires rather than in the U.S. This remains
an open question.
In any event, the weight of evidence suggests that, one century ago, Chicago
already had higher income levels than Buenos Aires. The next two subsections will
While wages were certainly lower in Buenos Aires than in Chicago, wages—
correcting for education—differ less. The Argentines appear to have been
signiﬁcantly less educated for much of this time period. Unfortunately, literacy
remains the primary means of measuring education levels, and that, of course, is a
quite coarse measure. Nonetheless, Fig. 4 shows literacy rates for Buenos Aires and
Chicago during our period.
In Chicago, overall literacy rates for the population aged ten or older start above
95% in 1870 and stay at that level for the next 60 years. There is a gap between
native and foreign born, but even among foreign born Chicago residents’ literacy is
never less than 87%. Native literacy is always over 98%, suggesting that pretty
much everyone in the city knew how to both read and write.
By contrast, the Buenos Aires data suggest that less than one-half of the
population could both read and write in 1869. By 1895, the next available data
point, the literacy rate had shot up to 72%, which still meant that a substantial
portion of the population was unable to either read or write. It is not until 1939 that
more than 90% of the population in Buenos Aires is literate. The data are not
entirely comparable since they refer to different age groups; still the differences are
quite striking.
Why is there such a difference in literacy rates between the two cities? Table 1
shows school enrollment rates over time for Chicago and Buenos Aires. While
enrollment rates are somewhat higher in the U.S., the rates seem much closer than
the literacy rates would suggest. The political leaders who came to power after
Rosas, such as Mitre and especially Sarmiento in the 1860s and 1870s, were quite

committed to public schooling. In 1884, Argentine law made free, secular public
schools a right—the Ley 1420 enacted by President Roca, and pushed by Sarmiento
in his post-presidency role as head of the National Education Council. There are
good reasons to believe that these schooling efforts were particularly successful in
the capital, as is apparent from the enrollment data. As such, we can not explain the
literacy gap with different enrollment rates alone.
One explanation for the difference is that immigrants who came to Argentina
were signiﬁcantly less literate than their American counterparts. Just as in the U.S.,
there is a gap between native and foreign born Argentines. In 1904, for example,
89% of native Argentines were literate, but only 72% of the foreign born in the city
could read and write. In 1900 Chicago, by contrast, 93% of the foreign born were
literate. Chicago’s more Germanic population appears to have been much more
skilled than the southern Europeans who came to Argentina. Even though Argentina
received a higher share of northern Italians, this did not overcome the basic pattern
of attracting much less literate people.
The skill differences between Buenos Aires and Chicago do not just reﬂect
differences in foreign immigration. They also reﬂect the different levels of
schooling in the American hinterland. Chicago was a city of immigrants, but it was
also a city full of farm boys and girls who had come to town. Likewise, a large share
of Buenos Aires residents was born outside the city in Argentina. While school
enrollment rates look broadly similar between Buenos Aires and Chicago, outside of
the cities the differences in schooling look rather more substantial.
During the ﬁrst part of the nineteenth century, American rural areas had
embraced the common school movement. Farmers throughout the country had been
convinced that educating their children was a worthwhile endeavor that would make
them more productive. By contrast, the large ranches that predominated in the
in intensive agriculture. Land appears to have been much more widely owned in the
U.S., and skills were presumably higher for yeomen farmers than for gauchos.
As a result, the rural areas that fed people to Chicago were reasonably well
schooled. The hinterland of Argentina was not, at least prior to 1880. For example,
the 1869 census shows that, even after the public education initiatives of the Mitre
presidency (although still at the outset of the heavily education-minded Sarmiento
presidency), only one in ﬁve Argentinean school-age children were enrolled in
school. Since that includes data on Buenos Aires, we are led to conclude that the
situation in the hinterland was considerably worse than that.
How much of an earnings wedge can be explained by literacy alone? Using data
on wages by occupation in 1940 (the ﬁrst time such data are available), we can
estimate a 1940 wage for each occupation in the 1900 U.S. Census. We then
estimate the average 1940 wage earned by literate and illiterate Chicagoans.
We ﬁnd that the average wage earned by an illiterate was 56 log points lower
than the average wage earned by someone who could read and write. That premium
survives controlling for individual age, and controlling for country of origin reduces
the measured premium to 34 log points.
While that premium is extremely signiﬁcant, it is not enough to explain most, or
even much, of the wage gap between Chicago and Buenos Aires at the turn of the
last century. 16% more of Argentina’s population was illiterate than the Chicago’s
population. Multiplying 16% by even a 56% wage loss leads to an estimate that
Buenos Aires should have had 8% higher wages if illiteracy was the only thing
holding them back. This modest number is dwarfed by the actual 70% wage gap.
Of course, illiteracy is presumably just proxying for a large educational gap
between the two groups. Still the wage gap seems far too large to be explained by
education alone in a simple model where human capital produces productivity. If
the returns to schooling were about 7% per annum, then Chicagoans would need to
have the equivalent of 10 extra years of schooling to explain the observed wage
difference, which is wildly implausible.
It is, of course, possible that wages impact earnings directly and through human
capital externalities. An example of such externalities might be that more education
leads to more innovation and better technology for everyone. In that case, the
impact of greater skills in Chicago would be larger. Still, we suspect that this effect
would show up mainly in the occupational and industrial distribution of the two
countries, and we turn to that next.
3.3 Industrialization
Both Chicago and Buenos Aires owed their growth to their roles as centers for the
shipment of natural produce. Both cities also developed other industries which
produced goods for people living in the hinterland and the residents of the city itself.
Cyrus McCormick is the quintessential example of an industrialist who moved his
mechanical reaper operation to Chicago in order to be close to his customers, the
farmers of the Midwest. Buenos Aires also had its industrialists, like Ernesto
and was far more capital-intensive on the eve of World War I. By 1900, 15% of
Chicago’s population, 262,261 workers, labored in industrial pursuit. Four years
later, only 7% of Buenos Aires’ population, 68,512 people, were in manufacturing.
After that point, however, the share of Chicago’s workers in manufacturing
stagnated while the share of Buenos Aires workers in manufacturing continued to
rise. As a result, their employment in industry converged. By 1914, Chicago had
313,000 industrial workers, or 13% of the city’s population. Buenos Aires province
had 149,000 industrial workers, which was 9.4% of the city’s population.
These similar employment shares were not matched by similar levels of output.
In 1914, the U.S. Census writes that the value of Chicago’s industrial output is 1.48
billion dollars (or 30 billion in current dollars); the value added by manufacturing
was 581 billion dollars (or about 12 billion dollars today). Each Chicago worker was
associated with 4728 dollars of output (about 100,000 dollars today) or 1856 dollars
of value added (about 38,000 dollars today).
In Buenos Aires, total output was 280 million dollars and value added was 122
million dollars. On a per capita basis, each Buenos Aires worker was producing
1880 dollars worth of output (or 38,000 dollars today) and 819 dollars of value
added (about 17,000 dollars today). Per worker output was 2.5 times higher in
Chicago than in Buenos Aires. Per worker value added appears to have been 2.25
times higher in Chicago than it was in Buenos Aires. This difference in productivity
is much larger than the 70% difference in manufacturing incomes that we found
during this time period.
Why was manufacturing more productive in Chicago than in Buenos Aires? One
hypothesis is that the level of capital per worker was higher in Chicago. In 1914, the
total capital in the manufacturing sector was 1.19 billion dollars or 3800 dollars per
worker (78,000 today). In 1914, Buenos Aires had 231 million dollars worth of
capital or 1550 dollars per worker (32,000 today). The Chicago workers had 2.44
times more capital per worker which may help to explain the higher levels of
productivity.
Using a standard Cobb–Douglas production function, we can estimate whether
these capital differences can help explain the labor productivity differences across
space. This assumes that output equals AKaL1-a, where A reﬂects productivity,
K reﬂects capital, L reﬂects labor and a reﬂects capital’s share in output (typically
taken to be one-third). This equation then implies that per worker productivity
equals A(K/L)a, which would equal A times the capital to labor ratio to the power
1/3. If the capital/labor ratio was 2.44 times higher in Chicago than in Buenos Aires,
this would predict that productivity would be 34% higher in Chicago. Thus, higher
capital levels alone can only explain about 27% of the higher productivity levels in
Chicago. The remaining 73% of the gap in productivity must be associated with the
catchall variable ‘‘A’’, which describes total factor productivity. To explain a 125%
greater productivity per worker in Chicago, total factor productivity must be 67%
higher in that city.
The productivity gap can come from three sources: human capital, transportation
costs and technological development. We have already noted that human capital
number of workers times human capital per worker, implies that per capita
productivity will increase by human capital to the power 2/3. If Chicago’s workers
had 20% more human capital per worker (which seems high), then this would
predict a 13% increase in productivity in Chicago, which can explain another 10%
of the observed productivity difference.
This would leave about 60% of the productivity difference to be explained by
differences in ‘‘A’’, the productivity parameter, reﬂecting either more developed
technologies or easier access to consumer markets. It is difﬁcult to determine how
much of the difference in productivity can be explained by either force. Chicago’s
industrialists certainly found it easier to sell to a much richer and larger market in
the United States. The total GDP of the U.S. was about 18 times larger than the GDP
of Argentina in 1913. Argentina’s hinterland was ﬁlled with large numbers of
relatively poor people; the farmers of the Midwest were much wealthier.
In principle, Argentina could have exported manufactured goods to Europe, but
they do not appear to have done that. Almost all of Argentina’s exports in 1914 were
agricultural, which surely reﬂects the country’s comparative advantage and the large
shipping costs for manufactured goods. By contrast, America was an industrial
exporter in 1900, and goods from Chicago, like McCormick’s reapers, were
traveling the globe. Still, it seems likely that these sales tell us more about
technology than about transportation costs. In principle, reapers built in Buenos
Aires could have been shipped to Russia, just like those in Chicago. It is not obvious
that the costs would have been that much higher, if at all. The difference was that
Chicago was at the cutting edge of reaper technology, while Buenos Aires was not.
A quick look at Chicago’s industrial sectors gives us a sense of the city’s level of
technology. Table 2 lists the top ﬁve industries, by employment, for Chicago in
1910 and Buenos Aires in 1914. A few large industries dominated Chicago
manufacturing in the years before World War I. The largest sector was men’s
clothing production, which employed 38,000 people in 1909. Another 37,000 were
in foundry and machine shop products. 27,000 worked in meat-packing. There were
also 33,000 in printing and publishing. 12,000 people worked in lumber. 12,000
more workers made cars. 11,000 Chicagoans made furniture and refrigerator units.
The meat-packers were directly transforming the products of Chicago’s hinterland,
but the others were working in more advanced products.
Clothing was also Buenos Aires largest industrial sector in 1914, with 36,000
workers. Moreover, the capital/labor ratios were pretty similar in both cities: both
men’s clothing in Chicago and ‘‘dressing’’ (vestido y tocador) in Buenos Aires had
about 750 dollars per worker in capital, which suggests that both industries were
labor-intensive and using relatively similar technologies. In the clothing sector, the
level of horsepower per capita was actually higher in Buenos Aires than in Chicago.
The fact that the clothing manufacturers in Chicago were more productive
presumably reﬂects more about the available market, than anything about the state
of clothing production technology in the Windy City. Chicago’s clothing
manufacturers had particularly beneﬁted by the distribution networks in the

Rosenwald (who led Sears, Roebuck after Sears).
However, in other areas, there is much more evidence of Chicago’s technology
superiority. For example, Chicago had about 12 times more employment in car
production in 1910 than Buenos Aires did in 1914. Automobiles in that era were a
cutting-edge technology. Argentines would purchase plenty of cars in the teens and
20s, but the bulk of them were imported, often from the United States.
Chicago had 37,000 people in foundry and machine shop products relative to
16,000 people in Buenos Aires in metallurgy. However, in this case, the Americans
appear to have been far more industrially advanced using 55,000 units of
horsepower (or 1.1 per worker) as opposed to 8000 (or 0.5 per worker) in Buenos
Aires. The Chicago workers had 2400 dollars of capital per worker; the blacksmiths
in Buenos Aires had less than half that. These different levels of capital suggest that
the Argentines were following a much more primitive model of metal machine
production than their Chicago counterparts.
Chicago also appears to have been at the forefront of a number of technological
breakthroughs, beyond McCormick and his reaper. In the nineteenth and early
twentieth centuries, Chicago innovators created the skyscraper, the electric washing
machine, the zipper and a host of other signiﬁcant inventions. It is difﬁcult to ﬁnd
any comparable breakthroughs for Buenos Aires.
Evidence for signiﬁcant differences in the state of technology also appears in
many industrial histories. For example, Torcuato DiTella was a leading Argentina
industrialist over the ﬁrst half of the twentieth century. While DiTella’s ﬁrst success
came with a bread-kneading machine that he invented himself, many of his later
successes came from importing American technology. For example, in the 1920s, he
catered to Argentina’s growing population of drivers (many of whom were in
American cars), by providing a new gas pump through a licensing arrangement with
the American Wayne Gas Pump company. In the 1930s, he began making
refrigerators, ﬁrst licensing from Kelvinator and then Westinghouse.
Why was Chicago more technologically sophisticated than Buenos Aires a
century ago? There were surely many reasons, but human capital seems like a
particularly important explanatory variable. Education helped spread ideas in the
U.S. and gave engineers the background needed for more innovation. The
differences in schooling between the two countries help us to understand why
America had more developed industries a century ago.
3.4 Politics
The ﬁnal major difference between Buenos Aires and Chicago lies in the area of
politics. The Argentine Constitution of 1853 has a large number of similarities to the
U.S. Constitution, which is not entirely coincidental, as the Argentines looked, in
part, to the U.S. model. As in the U.S., there are three branches of government, and
a bi-cameral legislature. The legislature included both a directly elected house, the
Chamber of Deputies, and an indirectly elected legislature, the Senate. Moreover,
between 1862 and 1930, Argentina maintained a reasonable amount of political
Argentina and the United States differed for at least some of that post-Rosas time
period. First, until 1912, Argentinean suffrage was far more restricted than that of
the United States. For example, after 1850, no U.S. state had property rights
requirements for voting. By 1860, any of the old tax requirements had also
disappeared. Of course, some American states did impose ‘‘literacy’’ qualiﬁcations,
often in an attempt to exclude African-Americans from voting, but aside from
African-Americans in southern states, essentially all American men could vote by
the Civil War.
By contrast, universal male suffrage did not appear in Argentina until 1912. For
example, as late as 1896, Banerjee et al. (2006) estimate that only 1.6% of
Argentina’s population voted, in part because of literacy and wealth requirements.
Alonso (1993) documents that 1.8% of the city’s population, or less than 4% of the
male population, voted in the 1896 election. By contrast, more than 40% of Illinois’
male population voted in the 1896 U.S. Presidential election, which suggests a far
more open democracy in Chicago than Argentina.
In addition to the limits on suffrage, the Argentinean electoral system did not
have a secret ballot. Instead, the voto cantado (‘‘sung ballot’’)—in which each voter
would come to the electoral precinct and loudly declare his preferred candidate,
upon which the electoral authority would write it down—guaranteed that a local
caudillo could pressure voters into supporting the candidate of his choosing.
Ironically, the allegedly liberal arguments often advanced by urban interests against
the extension of the franchise—the idea that rural oligarchs would just manipulate
their workers’ votes—found their match in the allegedly enlightened arguments of
the landed oligarchy against the secret ballot, as they argued that it would deprive
ignorant workers from the ‘‘healthy inﬂuence’’ of their landlords (Sampay 1974).
Argentina’s voting rules evolved over the period 1890–1910 (Alonso, 1993), and
the country moved to universal manhood suffrage and the secret ballot in 1912, with
´
˜
the passage of the Saenz Pena law. Engerman et al. (2000) document that voter
participation increased to 9% (or 18% of the male population) in the 1916 election
and 12.8% (or 25% of the male population) in the 1928. By 1920, both Chicago and
Buenos Aires had mass democracy, but that democracy was much younger in
Argentina. As (at least some) political institutions take time to mature, the novelty
of that democracy in Argentina may have added to its weakness.
Not only were electoral rules different between the two cities until 1912,
electoral practices were as well. It is unclear if Buenos Aires or Chicago had more
electoral corruption, as allegations of voter abuse ﬂew in both places. Textbooks on
Argentinean history regularly describe the corruption of nineteenth century politics.
The voto cantado system, in particular, gave tremendous power to the electoral
judges who were in charge of writing down the vote announced by each voter and
invited widespread corruption on their part. For example, Rock (1987) writes that
‘‘only a small fraction of the nominally enfranchised population voted in elections,
which local bosses regulated by manipulating the electoral roles or by simple
bribery and intimidation.’’
However, American politics during the Gilded Age was hardly a model of
most famous of all Gilded Age political stories. As late as 1960, rumors alleged that
Mayor Daley had manufactured vast numbers of votes for John F. Kennedy in
Chicago. Since electoral fraud is hard to measure, and allegations of fraud abound in
both places, it would be hard to claim any clear ranking between the two cities in
that area.
In any event, it is certainly true that mass violence was far more regular in
Argentina than in the U.S., at least after the bloodbath of the Civil War. It is clear
that elections in Chicago were not leading to major armed outbreaks. America, of
course, did have one election which ended up in open warfare, but after 1865
disagreements over outcomes did not lead to large-scale battles. Not so in
Argentina.
Buenos Aires was no stranger to political conﬂict during the late nineteenth
century and early twentieth century. In 1880, 1890, 1893 and 1905, Argentina
experienced major uprisings; three of those started in Buenos Aires, and the fourth
also reached it. The 1880 uprising was associated with the election of Julio Roca as
President of Argentina. Roca was seen as favoring nationalization over decentralization and he defeated Carlos Tejedor, a favorite in Buenos Aires. After the
electoral defeat, 10,000 Buenos Aires residents rose up and a bloody battle ensued
with 3000 casualties. Roca secured the presidency, and the centralization of
Argentina, only by suppressing the revolt.
After that point, the Republica Conservadora (‘‘Conservative Republic’’) that
´
lasted between 1880 and 1916, under the oligarchic rule of the so-called Generacion
´
del’80 (‘‘Year’80 Generation’’), faced constant pressure from the ‘‘Radical’’
opposition. This often spilled into armed conﬂict, such as in 1890, 1893 and 1905.
The 1890 revolution was associated with the somewhat leftist Civic Union group,
which was actually led by Mitre himself, and it aimed to topple the President Miguel
Celman. In that, the uprising succeeded and led to the presidency of Carlos
Pellegrini, who was a general opposing the revolt. In 1893, an uprising led by the
Radical Civic Union, an offshoot of the Civic Union, started in the Santa Fe region
of Argentina, but also spilled over into the capital city. In 1905, the Radical Civic
Union led another revolt in Buenos Aires, which was unsuccessful. In addition, the
anarchist- and socialist-inﬂuenced labor movement brought about by European
immigrants contributed to the political turmoil with massive strikes such as the
‘‘tenants’ strike’’ of 1907 and the ‘‘Red Week’’ of 1909.
The coup of 1930, which would oust President Yrigoyen, is often seen as a
turning point in Argentine politics, where democracy was replaced with military
rule. However, we have seen that this coup was hardly without precedent. Four
times between 1880 and 1905, revolts started or reaching Buenos Aires shook the
country and often achieved a fair amount of success. This suggests a degree of
instability in Buenos Aires that was much more extreme than in Chicago.
Chicago did have uprisings, most notably the Haymarket Riot of 1886 and the
Chicago Race Riot of 1919. The labor union movement also made its presence felt,
of course, as illustrated by the Haymarket episode, the ‘‘Teamsters’ strike’’ of 1905
and the ‘‘Garment strike’’ of 1910, all of which ended with many killed and injured
Buenos Aires than in Chicago, by the 1920s, after Prohibition, the picture is
essentially reversed.
While both Chicago and Buenos Aires had uprisings, their consequences were
vastly disparate. If the immediate consequences of the Haymarket riot were the
controversial execution of seven anarchists and a boost to May Day commemorations around the world, the Buenos Aires events had far more direct consequences
for the Argentinean political system. The Revolution of the Park, in 1890, while
defeated by government forces, still led to the fall of President Celman. The 1893
Revolution also took over the Casa Rosada before being defeated. In fact, the
´
˜
consensus interpretation of the Saenz Pena law among historians describes it as
largely motivated by the rising tension and the pressure exerted by the Radical
opposition, galvanized by the battle cry of the secret ballot and universal suffrage,
and by the labor movement. As a result of the electoral reform, the Conservative
Republic also met its demise in 1916, when the Radical Yrigoyen won the
presidency in the ﬁrst election under the new rules.
What can explain these different consequences? The relative immaturity of the
Argentine democracy certainly played a part, but it is also the case that the location
of Buenos Aires at the very heart of the country’s politics, as the all-important
˜
capital city in which by 1914 more than one in six Argentineans lived, made Porteno
turmoil more consequential. In fact, Argentina still is one of the countries with the
highest concentration of population around the capital city in the whole world—it
has the highest concentration among countries with large territories—using the
measure developed in Campante and Do (2010).
The centrality of Buenos Aires, of course, is not simply related to its designation
as the capital city. From the very early years of the independent Republic, the city’s
enormous weight in terms of population and economic activity, which was
engendered by its position as the gateway to the hinterland and by the low labor
intensity of the dominant cattle-raising activity, posed a constant challenge to the
Argentinean federal system. This is illustrated by the perennial tension between the
Province of Buenos Aires—which was still ﬁghting the idea of joining the Union, in
the battleﬁeld, as late as 1862—and the other provinces, which culminated in the
federalization of the city of Buenos Aires in 1880. Chicago, in contrast, was a
relative latecomer to the Union, which the state of Illinois joined more than 40 years
after independence—and Chicago, of course, is not even the capital of that state.
In any event, the fact is that the 1890 Revolution, for instance, started in the
Artillery Park, located a half-mile from the Casa Rosada. The Haymarket riot, in
contrast, took place some 700 miles away from the White House. For this reason, it
is very likely that the political and social instability that brewed in the similar
environments of Chicago and Buenos Aires, both of which were undergoing rapid
transformation, had much more detrimental consequences for Argentina in terms of
the consolidation of its democracy.
There is a strong connection between urban concentration in and around a
primate capital and political instability (Ades and Glaeser 1995; Campante et al.
2016), which reﬂects causality running in both directions. For at least 2500 years,
was ended by another urban coup. The history of Europe’s great medieval cities,
like Bruges, is replete with organized opposition to aristocratic rules. France’s
political instability in the nineteenth century owes much to the power of Parisian
mobs to topple governments.
The fundamental ingredient in a successful revolt is scale: isolated activists can
do little to challenge a government. Urban density makes it easier to form
connections, which can create a sufﬁciently large uprising. Riots are, after all, a
primarily urban phenomenon (DiPasquale and Glaeser 1997). The political
importance, however, of urban riots depends on their proximity to power (Campante
et al. 2016). That explains why uprisings in Buenos Aires were so much more
important than those in Chicago.
The political power of urban mobs can lead to two political responses. The ﬁrst is
to placate the mob with public handouts and services (Campante et al. 2016).
Classical Rome’s vast bread doles, for example, can be understood as an attempt to
cool the mobs organized by the Gracchus and others. The general tendency of
developing countries to target public services to the capital is a more modern
example of this phenomenon. Of course, placating urban unrest has the effect of
then further expanding the size of the capital city. For this reason, the connection
between political instability and capital size is two-sided. A large capital appears to
create instability, and instability means that services ﬂow to the capital, which
attracts migrants and further increases its size.
In some cases, political leaders respond to the threat created by urban unrest by
moving their capital far away from the city (Campante et al. 2016). When Peter the
Great moved his capital to St. Petersburg he was protecting his regime from the
inﬂuence of Muscovites. Likewise, America’s founders chose to create a new
capital on the Potomac, in part to reduce the inﬂuence of people in New York and
Philadelphia (America’s ﬁrst capitals). America’s largest riot, the 1863 New York
City draft riot, could have had a much larger inﬂuence on history if New York,
rather than Washington, had been the capital of the U.S.
In light of these facts, we are led to conclude that the large, primate capital of
Argentina might have played a major role in the nation’s twentieth century political
problems.

4 Did those differences matter?
We have argued that, despite the enormous similarities between Chicago and
Buenos Aires, there were substantial differences in income, education, industrial
development and political institutions. The main question that remains is the extent
to which each one of those differences might be able to account for the different
paths of Buenos Aires and Chicago, and more broadly those of Argentina and the
U.S., in the twentieth century. In principle, any one of those differences could have
played a role. A ‘‘big push’’ theory of growth (e.g. Rosenstein-Rodan 1943; Murphy
et al. 1989) might suggest that higher levels of income could have put the U.S. on a
that Buenos Aires was far less industrial than Chicago, and far more dependent on
natural resources, set the stage for the declines of the 1930s, when the price of
natural resources plummeted. The political differences of Buenos Aires might have
played a role in explaining the political traumas that Argentina experienced over the
twentieth century.
A system with two countries and four potential explanatory variables is, of
course, overdetermined. The only way to evaluate the relative importance of these
four factors is to bring in other countries. We will do this directly, by running a set
of cross-national regressions, while drawing on the long literature on the
determinants of differences in country-level prosperity, such as Hall and Jones
(1999). Although the limitations of cross-country regressions are well known, they
can nevertheless provide us with a benchmark quantitative assessment of our
candidate explanations.
We start from the premise that there is a link between relevant outcomes such as
income today and variables in the early twentieth century, and that we can look at
100-year regressions at the cross-country level to estimate the impact that the latter
have on the former. We then multiply these estimated coefﬁcients by the differences
in initial conditions between the U.S. and Argentina, to get a sense of the amount of
today’s differences that can be explained by the different initial conditions in this
speciﬁc comparison. Essentially, we are assuming a model of the following form:
X
YToday;j ¼
bi Xi;1900;j þ ej ;
ð1Þ
i

where YToday;j is country j’s outcome today, bi is the coefﬁcient on explanatory
variable i, Xi;1900;j is the value of explanatory variable i in country j in 1900 and ej is
a country-speciﬁc error term. This estimating equation then suggests that the differences in outcomes between Argentina and the U.S. today can be understood as
follows:
X
YToday;US À YToday;Argentina ¼
bi ðXi;1900;US À Xi;1900;Argentina Þ þ eUS À eArgentina :
i

ð2Þ
The ratio

bi ðXi;1900;US ÀXi;1900;Argentina Þ
YToday;US ÀYToday;Argentina

is the share of the current differences between

Argentina and the U.S. that can be explained by variable i. The cross-country
regressions will furnish our estimates of the coefﬁcients bi .
Our primary outcome variable is the logarithm of per capita GDP in 2000,
calculated using purchasing power parity and taken from the Maddison (2008) data
set. Since GDP is typically measured at the country, not city level, we will be using
national GDP measures and national characteristics a century ago. Using this
variable, the difference in log of GDP per capita between the U.S. and Argentina is
1.2, which means that American incomes were 230% higher than those in Argentina
in 2000. This is, of course, much larger than the 48% difference shown in 1900 GDP
much of the work on Argentina has emphasized the interaction of political and
economic distress (e.g. della Paolera and Gallo 2003). We focus on the democracy
score of the country, as measured by the ‘‘Polity 2’’ variable from the Polity IV data
set, averaged between 1970 and 2000. This measure subtracts a 0-to-10 ‘‘Autocracy’’ score from a 0-to-10 ‘‘Democracy’’ score (both of which constitute indices of
institutional features), resulting in values ranging from - 10 to 10. We use a longrun political average, because democracy measures vary substantially from year to
year. Moreover, Argentina’s current political environment is far more stable than
even its recent past, and looking only at the most recent data would understate the
extent of the country’s political turbulence. (For the period average, Argentina
scores 2.06, while the U.S. scores 10.) We will look at GDP ﬁrst, then politics, and
then ask whether controlling for current politics helps us to understand the
differences in GDP.
Our key explanatory variables are per capita GDP in 1900 [from Maddison
(2008)], which is available for 37 countries, and measures of school enrollment for
the same year (from Banks). Our school variable adds together the enrollment rates
for primary, secondary and university education. (The most important variable is
primary education, and results are similar if we use that variable alone.) We have 36
countries with this variable. Our third variable is the share of manufacturing in total
output in the early twentieth century, which we obtain from multiple sources
(Milward and Saul 1977; Bulmer-Thomas 1994; Engerman and Sokoloff 2000;
Urquhart 1993). (The actual year varies by country, between 1899 and 1920; most
come from around 1913.) This variable captures the degree of industrialization a
century ago, but it is only available for 16 countries. Finally, we use the average of
the Polity 2 variable between 1870 and 1900 to measure institutional development.
As these variables are often quite collinear, and as they are available for different
subsamples of countries, we begin by examining the univariate relationship between
these explanatory variables and the logarithm of per capita GDP in 2000.
Regression (1) in Table 3 shows the relationship between GDP in 1900 and GDP
today. The lagged variable explains 65% of the variation in current GDP across the
37 countries. Essentially, the elasticity is one, meaning that if a country was 10%
richer than another in 1900, then it is 10% richer today.
Figure 5 shows the relationship between income in 1900 and income today. The
relationship certainly is tight, but Argentina is an outlier, falling substantially below
the regression line. If we were to accept the coefﬁcient of 1.01 on log GDP per
capita in 1900, then initial income levels would only predict a 0.4 log point
difference today. This translates into a difference of about 49%, which is just about
one-ﬁfth of the total difference in incomes between Argentina and the U.S.
In the second regression, we look at the connection between our schooling
variable and GDP today. The R-squared rises to 70%, and as the share of the
population attending school increases by 5%, then GDP today increases by 0.7 log
points. This is about doubling. This captures the enormously strong connection that
schooling in the past appears to have with current income levels (as in Glaeser et al.

income today. In this case, Argentina lies on the regression line and the U.S. is
somewhat beneath it.
Can the difference in schooling explain current income levels? We will return to
this question later, when we have controlled for other variables, but a simple thought
experiment using the univariate coefﬁcient suggests that power of education. The

Buenos Aires may have had comparable enrollment rates to Chicago, outside the
city education levels were far lower than in the U.S. Multiplying 0.12 by the
estimated coefﬁcient of 14.4 suggests a current income difference of 1.80 log points,
which is actually substantially larger than the realized income difference. While this
fact tells us nothing about whether schooling is actually determining the gap or
whether it is just proxying for something else, the raw coefﬁcient suggests that the
cross-country relationship in income suggested by 1900 schooling levels can
account for the current differences between Argentina and the U.S.
Our third regression looks at the share of manufacturing in output around 1913.
We only have 16 observations, but again, the relationship with current income is
positive and signiﬁcant. As in the case of income, however, even the univariate
regression does not suggest that this variable is powerful enough to explain more
than a quarter of the current difference between the U.S. and Argentina.
Finally, we look at the correlation between political instability in the late
nineteenth century and GDP today. The explanatory power of this variable is much
weaker than the other variables. As Fig. 7 shows, there are plenty of once
unstable countries that are now quite prosperous. Argentina may have been less
stable than the U.S., but it was more stable and democratic than many European
countries which are now far more prosperous. Still, the correlation between
nineteenth century instability and wealth today might explain something of the
current differences between Argentine and U.S. wealth. Using the univariate
coefﬁcient, we ﬁnd that the differences in the historical politics measures would
predict a 0.7 log point difference in incomes today, which is more than half of the
total income differences.

have a chance at explaining signiﬁcant amounts of the differences in income
between the U.S. and Argentina. The other variables appear less important. To sort
out the relative importance of these different variables, we now turn to multivariate
regressions. In regression (5), we include both GDP and schooling as control
variables. The coefﬁcient on GDP drops by almost 75% and becomes statistically
indistinguishable from zero; the coefﬁcient on schooling retains statistical
signiﬁcance but drops by one-half. The bulk of this drop does not come from
controlling for income, but rather from restricting the sample size. We do not have
GDP ﬁgures in 1900 for many poorer countries, especially in Latin America; as a
result, the sample becomes wealthier and the coefﬁcient (which is smaller across
richer countries) becomes smaller.
In regression (6), we control for manufacturing and schooling. When we control
for schooling, the coefﬁcient on manufacturing is very small, and just borderline
signiﬁcant at the 10% level. The coefﬁcient on the schooling variable is 7.4. When
we include GDP in the regression (not shown), controlling for manufacturing drives
the coefﬁcient on GDP in 1900 essentially to zero; the coefﬁcients on the other two
variables remain largely unaffected, but the signiﬁcance of manufacturing is
removed. In regression (7), we control for politics as well as the schooling variable.
In this case, politics becomes insigniﬁcant, and the coefﬁcient on schooling is
essentially the same as in the univariate case.
These results strengthen the case for the central role played by differences in
schooling, but we still need to investigate what happens when the full set of
variables is simultaneously included. This is what we do in regression (8) (with the
exception of manufacturing, which causes our sample to shrink too much). With all
three variables, schooling remains signiﬁcant with a coefﬁcient of 7.6. The other
two variables are not. We take away from these regressions the view that no
variable, other than schooling in 1900, has a reliable correlation with GDP in 2000.
The coefﬁcient on schooling ranges from 7.5 to 14.5.
We have already shown that if the schooling coefﬁcient is 14.5 it can more than
explain the current differences between Argentina and the U.S. How much of those
differences can schooling in 1900 predict if the coefﬁcient is smaller? For example,
if the coefﬁcient is 10, then the differences in schooling levels in 1900 would predict
a 1.2 log point difference in current incomes, which is exactly the difference in
2000. If the coefﬁcient is 7.5, then the schooling difference can explain 75% of the
current income differences. As such, human capital in 1900 seems to predict the
lion’s share of the difference in current incomes.
But why would historical human capital levels predict such large income
differences? One obvious explanation is that human capital in 1900 predicts human
capital today and that current human capital differences explain the gap between the
U.S. and Argentina. It is certainly true that schooling in 1900 is strongly correlated
with schooling today: the correlation coefﬁcient between our enrollment data and
total years of schooling in 2000 taken from Barro-Lee (2000) is 85%.
Moreover, years of schooling today certainly strongly predict income levels. A
univariate regression of log of GDP on total years of schooling in 2000 ﬁnds a
univariate coefﬁcient literally suggests that current schooling differences can
explain 98% of the current GDP gap between the U.S. and Argentina.
But what does this univariate coefﬁcient mean? Our cross-country coefﬁcient
certainly implies a much higher effect than estimates from individual-level studies,
where an extra year of schooling rarely increases wages by more than 10 or at most
15% (e.g. Ashenfelter and Krueger 1994; Card 1999). If that lower range of
coefﬁcients represented the link between education and productivity, then higher
education levels in the U.S. can explain less than one-third of the difference in
incomes between Argentina and the U.S.
How can we reconcile the gap between individual-level estimates of human
capital effects and country-level estimates of human capital effects? One view is
that the larger coefﬁcients at the national level represent human capital spillovers.
Living in a country with more skilled individuals may make everyone more
productive, perhaps because skilled workers are responsible for determining the
level of technology in a given country. However, cross-metropolitan area studies of
human capital spillovers generate an estimate that is positive, but far too small to
account for the size of the cross-country coefﬁcient (Rauch 1993; Acemoglu and
Angrist 2000).
One explanation for the difference between the cross-city estimates and the crosscountry estimates is that—as suggested by Glaeser et al. 2007), building on the
famous Lipset (1959) hypothesis—schooling is responsible for political outcomes.
In particular, stable democratic institutions tend to be predicated on the level of
schooling of the citizenry. According to this view, Argentina’s problematic political
history during the twentieth century has its roots in the relatively lower human
capital levels of the country in 1900.2 To test this hypothesis, in Table 4, we
reproduce the exercise from Table 3, but now with political stability between 1970
and 2000 as our dependent variable.
The ﬁrst four regressions repeat the univariate relationships shown in Table 3. As
before, all of these variables predict the outcome variable. Schooling has the
strongest correlation with democracy during the late twentieth century, but the other
variables also predict democratic stability. In the ﬁfth regression, we include all of
the variables—again with the exception of manufacturing, which depletes too much
of the sample. In this case, schooling continues to predict democracy, and the
coefﬁcient is essentially unchanged. None of the other variables remain statistically
signiﬁcant.
Can the schooling differences between Argentina and the U.S. explain the
instability of late twentieth century Argentina, in a quantitative sense? The
difference in the two outcome variables is 7.94. The estimated coefﬁcient on
schooling is approximately 52. Multiplying 52 by the schooling difference in 1900

The relatively low levels of human and physical capital might have inﬂuenced political instability in
Argentina through yet another channel. Campante and Chor (2012) show evidence that, in countries that
are relatively land-abundant, individual schooling tends to be more strongly associated with political
activity, particularly for ‘‘conﬂictual’’ modes of activity such as demonstrations. This suggests that, for
the case of Argentina, its dearth of physical and human capital relative to the U.S. meant that the

yields an estimate of 6.24, which is 79% of the observed instability difference.
While the schooling differences cannot explain all of the differences in democracy,
they can certainly go most of the way.
Our ﬁnal exercise is to see whether the connection between education and
democracy can explain why schooling in 1900 is so correlated with incomes today.
Going back to the speciﬁcation from Table 3, we now include the twentieth century
politics variable in a regression that also includes schooling in 1900. Including this
variable causes the coefﬁcient on schooling to decrease by more than a third,
relative to the univariate regression, but the coefﬁcient remains 8.87, which is still
quite high. If we include both democracy today and GDP in 1900 as controls, then
the coefﬁcient on schooling in 1900 falls to 2.7 and is no longer signiﬁcantly
different from zero, as shown in regression (9). We interpret these regressions as
suggesting that much of the impact of relatively low levels of schooling in
Argentina went through political channels.
Whatever remains of the schooling effect may work either through unmeasured
political channels, or direct human capital effects, or through better technology.
Hopefully, further work will better help us to understand the strong connection
between historical schooling and current GDP in a broader context. In our speciﬁc
case, however, it does seem to be true that Argentina’s collapse, relative to the U.S.,
had much to do with lower education levels.

5 Conclusion
There were many similarities between the historical trajectories of Chicago and
Buenos Aires. Both cities were conduits for natural wealth coming from the
American hinterland to the markets of the east. Both cities dealt in the same
products, ﬁrst animals and then grain. Both cities grew spectacularly and were
cities. Chicago was wealthier and better educated. Its industries were more
advanced and more capital intensive. Its political system was more stable, and its
instability was less consequential. All told, Buenos Aires looks more like a place
that became rich because of a boom in natural resources. Chicago used those natural
resources and then transitioned into becoming a more modern industrial place, with
substantially greater levels of physical and human capital.
The gap in industrial development and human capital then set the stage for the
twentieth century. Across countries, schooling in 1900 strongly predicts success
today, partially because less schooled places have had far worse political outcomes.
America’s greater level of human capital in 1900 surely deserves much credit for its
track record of twentieth century political stability. In this regard, the effects of the
lower levels of human capital in Buenos Aires were in turn magniﬁed by its
overwhelming political importance within Argentina. All in all, the divergence
between Chicago and Buenos Aires reﬂects the fact that Buenos Aires in 1900 had
wealth levels that were far higher than its actual level of human and physical capital
accumulation.
From a slightly broader perspective, particularly within the context of Latin
America, this conclusion sounds somewhat dispiriting. After all, by the standards of
the region, Argentina did invest early and heavily in human capital accumulation
and achieved a stage of near-universal literacy and enrollment way before most of
its neighbors—many of which are still considerably off that mark. Still, it seems that
the human capital lag it displayed in comparison with the US or Western Europe,
even in its heyday, ended up trapping the country with relatively immature political
institutions. This fragility was in turn made more acute by the geographical
concentration of population and economic activity around Buenos Aires and
eventually plunged the country into a cycle of instability from which its economic
performance could not escape unscathed. President Sarmiento seemed to have his
ﬁnger on the right issue when he stated that ‘‘all problems are problems of
education’’, but for Argentina we might add that this recognition was not enough.
