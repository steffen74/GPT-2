Recently it has become feasible to estimate afﬁne models of the term structure in a
routine manner. Such models produce term premia estimates and, therefore, allow
us to back out expectations of the future path of short-term interest rates. As such
they are extremely useful for the evaluation of the efﬁcacy of monetary policy and
the anchoring of interest rate expectations. Several newly available technologies
have been proposed to estimate these models, but a particularly attractive one is that
of Adrian et al. (2013) (henceforth ACM). Their approach uses OLS to estimate
models that previously required maximum likelihood. The ‘cost’ associated with
this is ﬁrst the necessary use of observable dynamic factors to drive the term
structure, and second the use of synthetic bond-price contracts derived from
parameterized yield curves. ACM claim extremely good performance compared to
more traditional alternatives. It is also computationally very inexpensive. Indeed,
the New York Federal Reserve Bank has recently begun publishing daily term
premia estimates using this method (see Adrian et al. 2014), complementing the
¨
daily publication of the yield curve estimates documented in Gurkaynak et al.
(2007).
There is considerable interest in ﬁtting such models. The afﬁne model enables us
to calculate implied term premia along the curve and even interest rate expectations,
although this requires us to assume that the term premia is the only source of risk
compensation. In the last ten years, we have seen considerable turbulence in
ﬁnancial markets and commensurate actions by the US Federal Reserve have
necessarily impacted upon Latin America. At the same time the Latin American
countries we investigate have been pursuing monetary policy based on inﬂation
targeting, with apparent success. We compare the results across countries where we
have used no common information in the estimation. Interestingly, we ﬁnd that
long-run interest rate expectations remain stable in each country while movements
in the term premia account for most of the observed variation in yields. The
variation in term premia is remarkably similar across countries, indicating that a
common factor seems to be at work. In several cases term premia correlates with the
US, with comovement at particular events. Regional correlations are strong, and
although the US affects Latin American countries in predicable ways the dominant
effect seems to be from domestic monetary policy.
Our analysis cannot prove by itself that inﬂation targeting has been the main
driver of improved economic conditions. There have been a number of complementary recent studies analyzing Latin American term structures such as De Pooter
et al. (2014), Ceballos et al. (2014), and Guarn et al. (2014) which are consistent
with our ﬁndings and the hypothesis that improved monetary policy has at least
partly been the cause. De Pooter et al. (2014) in particular show that Latin
¨
American inﬂation expectations are strongly anchored. As Ellingsen and Soder¨
strom (2001) discuss, long-run nominal rates reﬂect expected policy rates, term
premia and inﬂation expectations. Decomposing the yield curve into policy rate
expectations and term premia allows us to further investigate the evolution of policy
¨
is another piece of evidence that inﬂation targeting has been a signiﬁcant driver.1
In what follows, we apply the ACM method to four inﬂation targeting Latin
American economies, using monthly zero-coupon yield data from Chile, Colombia,
Mexico and Peru from 2005 to 2014, encompassing the global ﬁnancial crisis and
aftermath. We also report selected results for the US and Brazil. We obtain
observable factors as the principal components of the term structure itself, and
estimate Nelson–Siegel yield curves for each to provide the necessary synthetic
contracts. The resulting curves allow us to ﬁt afﬁne models in a few seconds and the
complete procedure is extremely easy to automate. To further anticipate our results
we ﬁnd that long-term policy rate expectations are solidly anchored for each of the
four selected countries. This accords with a story of credible monetary policies
linked to well-understood inﬂation targets. Almost all variations in yields are
attributed to variation in term premia.
The present paper is organized as follows. The next section outlines the
collection of methods used, both for yield curve estimation and for the ACM
estimates. Sections 3 and 4 contain our empirical analysis, using Colombian data as
an illustration for the methods before discussing the term premia estimates and their
behavior. A ﬁnal Sect. 5 concludes.

2 Econometric approach
The interesting results here are the estimated term premia, but these are obtained
using a multi-step process. We ﬁrst outline the general approach we use, brieﬂy
describing the Nelson and Siegel (1987) method and then the less familiar afﬁne
model and ACM estimation approach in more detail. Although we need to use a
multi-step approach to generate the required data, each step is conceptually simple
and provides information that is interesting in its own right.
2.1 Nelson–Siegel method
It is often useful to have parsimonious models of yield curves, and there have been a
number of suggested methods. In particular, Nelson and Siegel (1987) proposed an
extremely simple cross-sectional approach to the estimation of yields curves. They
simply ﬁt

across the available maturity dimension s, and the three terms have become associated with the level, slope and curvature of the yield curve. The four parameters of

In an ideal world (and as suggested by a referee) we would have used selected non-inﬂation targeting
countries as a control group, but data available to us on Bloomberg were of insufﬁciently good quality to
build satisfactory models. Even then, the spillovers from neighbors with ‘good’ monetary policy could
weighted by (inverse) duration. A second curvature term was proposed by Svensson
(1995) and is often used. Diebold and Rudebusch (2013) give an excellent description of this and related methods.
Although we experimented with the Svensson extension the simplest speciﬁcation was easily adequate, so we use Nelson–Siegel curves throughout. This is
¨
similar to Gurkaynak et al. (2007) who use Nelson–Siegel curves for US Treasuries
until the end of 1979 and Svensson curves thereafter. We provide evidence of the ﬁt
below. Once constructed we can then generate yields in any period for any value of
s. Thus for any month-end data, say September 2010, we can calculate implied
contracts for any s and then use the data from end-October for the relevant monthsto-go. Essentially we are able to calculate relative ﬁxed event yields without the
actual data. This is a key input into the ACM estimation procedure that enables us to
price using linear regressions.
2.2 Afﬁne models of yields
Afﬁne models, for example Ang and Piazzesi (2003), make the following
assumptions about what drives the term structure. Each yield curve depends on a
set of factors, Zt , which can be either macro-factors or some implied state variables.
We will assume that these factors can be adequately modeled using a simple ﬁrstorder VAR such as
Ztþ1 ¼ l þ UZt þ vtþ1 ; vtþ1 $ Nð0; RÞ:

ð1Þ

In what follows, the factors are obtained as the principal components of the implied
term structure.
Now we make the important modeling assumptions about how the prices of
bonds are determined. The pricing equations are constructed using the recursive
structure implied by the yield curve itself under the assumption of no-arbitrage, and
are given by
Â
Ã
ð2Þ
Pn ¼ Et Mtþ1 PnÀ1
t
tþ1
where Pn is the price of a discount bond in period t with n periods to go and Mt is a
t
suitable stochastic discount factor. The values of n in effect discretize the durations
above with a unit being the sampling period. In logs, and making the assumption of
log-normal shocks, we can write (2) as
Â
Ã 1
Â
Ã
nÀ1
pn ¼ Et mtþ1 þ pnÀ1 þ vart mtþ1 þ ptþ1
t
tþ1
2

ð3Þ

where lower case denotes the log of the upper case equivalent and we use the fact
that if k ¼ ln K, then ln Et ½K ¼ Et ½k þ 1 rk;t .
2
In turn, the stochastic discount factor is deﬁned in logs as
1
1
mtþ1 ¼ Àrt À k0t kt À k0t RÀ2 vtþ1
2

1

kt ¼ RÀ2 ðk0 þ k1 Zt Þ:
As Ang and Piazzesi (2003) and many others discuss, this gives a tractable formulation of the discount factor that has predictable effects, although it is not necessarily consistent with the assumptions we make elsewhere in the model about the
implied form of the discount factor. Log prices themselves are assumed afﬁne in the
state variables
pn ¼ ÀAn À B0n Zt
t

ð5Þ

and equivalently pnÀ1 ¼ ÀAnÀ1 À B0nÀ1 Ztþ1 . This powerful setup allows for time

varying price of risk terms through the state dependency of kt .
We need relatively little more to derive a recursive structure for the parameters of
the yield curve. Equating (3) and (5) given (4) yields

Taking expectations appropriately and dropping the conditionality of the variance
operator yields the last line straightforwardly.
Finally, the short rate is assumed to be
r t ¼ p1
t
and modeled as
rt ¼ d0 þ d01 Zt :
This is again an afﬁne function of the factors. Collecting terms we obtain

ð7Þ

B0n ¼ d01 þ B0nÀ1 ðU À Rk01 Þ:

[(see for example Wickens (2008), Chapter 11]. Prices can be converted easily into
yields, consistent with the Nelson–Siegel curves.
We can also derive the implied risk neutral curves by setting the price of risk
terms k0 and k1 to zero. Thus an equivalent recursion consisting of
1
An ¼ d0 þ AnÀ1 À B0nÀ1 RBnÀ1

ð9Þ

B0n ¼ d01 þ B0nÀ1 U:

ð10Þ

generates the implied expected prices. Again these can be converted into expected
yields and a similar formula gives expected interest rates. These are discussed in
detail in, for example, Joyce et al. (2010). Essentially we need to program up
additional recursions in the same form as (7) and (8) or (9) and (10). As noted in the
introduction the term premium is assumed to be the only source of risk compensation and it is this which allows us to easily back out interest rate expectations.
2.3 The ACM approach
The model above has a number of parameters to estimate, and is often ﬁtted using
maximum likelihood methods under suitable identifying restrictions. As we noted
above, ACM ﬁrst assume that the factors can be observed and estimate the factor
model independently of the other parameters. This will be done by taking principal
components of the term structure itself. Second, they deﬁne the ex-post holdingperiod excess return as
xnÀ1 ¼ pnÀ1 À pn À rt :

If we can condition on known Z and x then only k and b in (18) need estimating.
ACM suggest taking n principal components of the term structure data and using
these as the Z variables. Additionally we can calculate x from some appropriately
parameterized pricing curves, and, of course, Nelson–Siegel curves are suitable.
ACM suggest a three-step estimation procedure:

This approach is incredibly simple, and can be coded in comparatively few lines.2
More than this, it is many orders of magnitude less expensive to calculate relative to
the maximum likelihood approach, and makes cross-country analysis very
straightforward. In the next section, as way of illustration we apply the methods
step-by-step to Colombian data before comparing the results across countries.

3 Data and yield curve estimation
We use a single country, Colombia, just to illustrate the methods. The results for
each country were very similar. Daily zero coupon benchmark yields were obtained
from Bloomberg for the four countries. We converted these to end-month values
and ﬁtted separate Nelson–Siegel curves to each time period and country. For
example, the data for Colombia for the 3-, 6-, 12-, 24-, 36-, 48-, 60-, 96- and
120-month yields from May 2006 through May 2014 are shown in Fig. 1.
We ﬁt3 Nelson–Siegel curves to the cross sections, and the resulting implied
yields are as shown in Figure 2. These are a remarkably close ﬁt, which justiﬁes the
choice of the simplest Nelson–Siegel speciﬁcation. This gives us all of the implied
contracts for the intermediate periods which can be obtained by appropriate choice
of s. Similar ﬁts are obtained for all four countries.

4 ACM results
We follow the exact three-step procedure adopted by ACM. This requires us to
obtain the principal components, determine an appropriate number to use, calculate
the holding-period excess returns and then ﬁt the k values. From these we can
calculate the implied afﬁne yield curves, term premia, the implied risk neutral
curves and hence interest rate expectations.
4.1 Principal components
For each country we ﬁrst calculate the implied yield curve from three months to ten
years at three-month intervals. We then take the principal components of these to
use as the factors. In general we ﬁnd that we need four factors to ﬁt a near-perfect
afﬁne model in each case. For Colombia these are shown in Fig. 3 and labeled
Component 1–4 for the ﬁrst to fourth component. The components themselves have
2

We coded the procedure in EViews 7.2. This has the advantage of handling the data very well, so that
we can, for example, vary the periodicity of the estimates easily.

no direct interpretation, but the ﬁrst factor clearly contains information for the
implied levels. It is not generally possible to associate the factors with the Nelson–
Siegel factors for example. Using the fourth factor typically allows us to improve
the ﬁt of the short end of the yield curve.4

4.2 Afﬁne yield curves
Four principal components were used as observed factors for each country, and the
ACM three-step procedure followed.5 The resulting afﬁne models ﬁt the yields quite
satisfactorily. Here we plot three representative cross sections in Fig. 4 for the
Colombian data above in March 2008, December 2010 and December 2012. These
correspond to periods before, during and since the ﬁnancial crisis. The lowest line in
each graph is the implied risk neutral curve where the values of k have been set to
zero and agents are, therefore, not seeking compensation for risk. This can be seen
to deviate in all cases quite sharply from the empirical curves. As should be evident
from these examples this is a very satisfactory ﬁt for an afﬁne model, with the
Colombian model often the worst in terms of pricing errors, and we can replicate a
sequence of individually estimated Nelson–Siegel curves with relatively few
parameters and the principal components.
4.3 Term premia and expected interest rates
It is central to our analysis that the four countries that we study are all inﬂation
targeters, see Hammond (2012). Currently Chile, Colombia and Mexico all have
inﬂation targets of 3 % (within a target band) and Peru has a central target of 2 %.
This generates steady-state predictions for policy rates, as credible inﬂation targets
should be associated with an appropriate long-run nominal interest rate. In particular
we expect longer dated expected nominal interest rate in Peru to be lower than the
5
As suggested by ACM we set the constant (l) in the VAR to zero, which is appropriate for stationary
data. This has a small effect on, for example, the estimated long-run interest rate, but has no effect on the

in the mid-2000 s Mexican and Colombian policy rates were markedly higher than
the other two.
Our sample periods are slightly different for each country which reﬂects data
availability, all ending in May 2014. Chile runs from October 2006, Colombia (as
noted above) from May 2006, Mexico from January 2006 and Peru from May 2006.
This gives around 95 observations per country.6 We now discuss the country results
in turn, where we plot the yield, the term premium and the expected interest rate at
2-, 5- and 10-year horizons for each.
Chile (Fig. 5) has perhaps the least interesting graphs but the most interesting
results; the expected rate asymptotes very quickly to approximately 5 % on an
annual basis. Term premia have markedly declined over the last decade, with some
variation around the ﬁnancial crisis and some evidence that they went negative at
the shortest horizon. The dynamics of the term structure seem to imply unusually
rapid convergence to the long run. However, they are extremely good news for
Chilean monetary policy makers, where long-run interest rate expectations are
strongly anchored in the very near future. Notice that estimated term premia have
recently remained low.
The story is similar in Colombia (Fig. 6), and here it is perhaps more surprising
as interest rates started higher. However, long-term expectations of the policy rate
are solidly anchored, perhaps slightly higher than for Chile, but nonetheless with
little sign of any change throughout the estimation period as can be seen in the
10-year (green) line. The higher yields in the long run for the early years of the
sample are attributed by the model entirely to term premia. We return to the
dynamics of this when we consider correlations with US premia below.
Mexico (Fig. 7) mirrors Colombia; term premia are slightly higher, expected
interest rates slightly lower. There is some evidence of a more elevated term
premium in the recent past, but otherwise the graphs are remarkably similar. Peru
(Fig. 8), with a lower inﬂation target delivers the lowest anticipated future interest
rate as expected, around 4 % rather than the 5 % or more in the other three
countries. Term premia are more volatile, but as with Chile, all movements in the
yields further out are attributable to term premia effects and not interest rate
expectations.
As an additional exercise we controlled for the effects of turbulence in ﬁnancial
markets over the crisis period by shortening the sample period by three years, so that
the samples all begin in 2009. At our monthly frequency this gives around 60
observations on stationary data, enough for reasonable inference. To illustrate the
results, we give the average of the ten-year expected rates in Table 1. Not only are
these the averages, they are also the expected values in every period as ten-year
expectations are extremely ﬂat across the estimation sample. For the three inﬂation
targeters that target inﬂation at 3 % the long-run expected interest rate is
6

In the majority of cases the yield data used in the estimation is from the last working day of the month.
The exception is a small number of cases for Chile; here the month-end data was either unavailable or
appeared to be entered into Bloomberg incorrectly (i.e., there were random spikes in the three- and sixmonth data which were not present in longer maturity yields). In these cases a day earlier in the month has

approximately 4:4 %. For Peru, targeting inﬂation a percentage point lower, the
expected interest rate is 3:3 % 10 years out. These numbers are lower than for the
full sample by around a percentage point, but are extraordinarily consistent with
each other, suggesting long-run real rates of about 1:5 % in every case. This seems a
little low, and we prefer the full sample estimates, but the message is the same.
Policy rate expectations are extremely well anchored in each case. To sum up;
inﬂation targeting appears to be working very well in these countries.
4.4 Correlations
If interest rate expectations are so well anchored by four entirely independent
monetary policies, it is interesting to ask how the term premia are correlated, both
between themselves and with the US on the assumption that the US is the dominant
ﬁnancial center. Note that the US Federal Reserve reacted strongly to a domestic
and then global ﬁnancial crisis with a variety of conventional and unconventional
means. For convenience we plot all four of our estimated ten-year term premia
together with the equivalent US term premia obtained from Adrian et al. (2014) in
Fig. 9.
Inspecting the levels of the term premia gives us an interesting insight into recent
developments. Note that all term premia fell in early 2012, with Chile and the US

sharp rise in term premia is detectable everywhere except for Chile. It seems likely
that the fall is associated with turbulence in the Euro area, with considerable worries
about the possibility of sovereign debt default there and the search for alternatives.
The rise in 2013 coincides with the announcement of possible tapering by the US
Federal Reserve.
In Table 2 we show the correlation of the two-year term premia estimates between
our selected countries as well as with the US and Brazil over the maximum available
sample periods. We include Brazil, a further Latin American inﬂation targeter.
However, Brazil has a much higher inﬂation target (4.5 %) with wider tolerance bands
and is perceived to have been less successful in achieving the target than the four main
cases we consider (see De Pooter et al. 2014).7 At this horizon Mexican and
particularly Colombian term premia are signiﬁcantly positively correlated with US
term premia. Brazilian term premia also turn out to be strongly positively correlated
with the US. This complements the narrative in Guarn et al. (2014), who point to a
negative correlation between Colombian and US yields; our numbers suggest the term
premia remained positively correlated. The observed negative correlation in yields
seems to be driven entirely by interest rate expectations.
This pattern is also evident at the 10-year horizon (Table 3). However, it is also
apparent that both Chilean and Peruvian term premia are largely uncorrelated with
the US at the ten-year horizon and even perhaps negatively correlated at the 2-year
one. Unsurprisingly, a case can be made that neighboring countries seem more
correlated at all horizons and there is a clear ranking in correlation with the US.8

Chile in particular seems different; term premia there have not recovered since 2011
which explains the decreasing correlation with the US.
It is also the case that over particular periods of stress there turns out to be
stronger correlation with the US. This is evident from Fig. 10 where we plot 2-year
rolling correlations of the 10-year term premia with the US. From 2010 onward
Colombia was temporarily much more correlated with the US but has recently
returned to previous values. Chile has been much less correlated with the US as term
premia have not responded to US monetary conditions.
Taken together the results seem to indicate that there was relatively little impact
on longer term expectations from the ﬁnancial crisis for the Latin American
economies that we study. There was considerable variation in the term premia over
this period, but except for Mexico, term premia seem a great deal lower post-crisis.

ACM model attributes them entirely to reduced term premia. Increased term premia
in the US since the onset of anticipated tapering seem to have raised term premia
everywhere except Chile. But in none of the countries we study have there been
apparent ﬂuctuations in long-term inﬂation expectations and hence equilibrium
nominal interest rates. Why have Chilean term premia failed to respond to the recent
upturn? Ceballos et al. (2014) estimate term premia using the method suggested by
Joslin et al. (2014) which are very similar to ours. They present some VAR
evidence that Chilean premia are sensitive to US ones. However, they too document
the lack of recent correlation. The apparent success of Chile in decoupling from US
term premia suggest an avenue for future study.

5 Conclusions
We use the empirical approach due to ACM to estimate dynamic term structure
models for four Latin American countries (Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru). To
our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst time this methodology has been applied to a cross
section of Latin American countries. Using estimated coefﬁcients from the widely
used Nelson–Siegel term structure model, we generate synthetic bond-price
contracts and use them to calculate a set of principal components. From these,
we can calculate the implied afﬁne yield curves and decompose them into implied
term premia and interest rate expectations. Our results point towards stable long-run
interest rate expectations, with movements in term premia accounting for most of
the observed variation in yields. Term premia in all four countries have declined
since 2006, despite the onset of the global ﬁnancial crisis in 2008. We ﬁnd evidence
of a comovement of term premia across the four countries for the longer dated
securities. While there is some comovement of term premia with the US, the
dominant effect seems to be domestic monetary policy, which may well be due to
the inﬂation targeting framework employed by the central banks in all four
countries.

Abstract Inﬂation targeting has been widely adopted in Latin America. In this
paper, we show evidence consistent with major beneﬁcial effects from so doing,
with falling term premia and anchored policy rate expectations. To do this we
construct term premia estimates using the method suggested by Adrian et al. (2013)
for selected inﬂation targeting Latin American economies. They use synthetic prices
constructed from estimated yield curves to derive holding-period excess returns and
condition on the principal components of the yields. This approach is extremely
easy to implement and fast to calculate. We detect a small drop in interest rate
expectations since the global ﬁnancial crisis but longer term rates seem remarkably
well anchored. There is also relatively low correlation between our estimated Latin
American and US term premia.

Recently it has become feasible to estimate afﬁne models of the term structure in a
routine manner. Such models produce term premia estimates and, therefore, allow
us to back out expectations of the future path of short-term interest rates. As such
they are extremely useful for the evaluation of the efﬁcacy of monetary policy and
the anchoring of interest rate expectations. Several newly available technologies
have been proposed to estimate these models, but a particularly attractive one is that
of Adrian et al. (2013) (henceforth ACM). Their approach uses OLS to estimate
models that previously required maximum likelihood. The ‘cost’ associated with
this is ﬁrst the necessary use of observable dynamic factors to drive the term
structure, and second the use of synthetic bond-price contracts derived from
parameterized yield curves. ACM claim extremely good performance compared to
more traditional alternatives. It is also computationally very inexpensive. Indeed,
the New York Federal Reserve Bank has recently begun publishing daily term
premia estimates using this method (see Adrian et al. 2014), complementing the
¨
daily publication of the yield curve estimates documented in Gurkaynak et al.
(2007).
There is considerable interest in ﬁtting such models. The afﬁne model enables us
to calculate implied term premia along the curve and even interest rate expectations,
although this requires us to assume that the term premia is the only source of risk
compensation. In the last ten years, we have seen considerable turbulence in
ﬁnancial markets and commensurate actions by the US Federal Reserve have
necessarily impacted upon Latin America. At the same time the Latin American
countries we investigate have been pursuing monetary policy based on inﬂation
targeting, with apparent success. We compare the results across countries where we
have used no common information in the estimation. Interestingly, we ﬁnd that
long-run interest rate expectations remain stable in each country while movements
in the term premia account for most of the observed variation in yields. The
variation in term premia is remarkably similar across countries, indicating that a
common factor seems to be at work. In several cases term premia correlates with the
US, with comovement at particular events. Regional correlations are strong, and
although the US affects Latin American countries in predicable ways the dominant
effect seems to be from domestic monetary policy.
Our analysis cannot prove by itself that inﬂation targeting has been the main
driver of improved economic conditions. There have been a number of complementary recent studies analyzing Latin American term structures such as De Pooter
et al. (2014), Ceballos et al. (2014), and Guarn et al. (2014) which are consistent
with our ﬁndings and the hypothesis that improved monetary policy has at least
partly been the cause. De Pooter et al. (2014) in particular show that Latin
¨
American inﬂation expectations are strongly anchored. As Ellingsen and Soder¨
strom (2001) discuss, long-run nominal rates reﬂect expected policy rates, term
premia and inﬂation expectations. Decomposing the yield curve into policy rate
expectations and term premia allows us to further investigate the evolution of policy
¨
is another piece of evidence that inﬂation targeting has been a signiﬁcant driver.1
In what follows, we apply the ACM method to four inﬂation targeting Latin
American economies, using monthly zero-coupon yield data from Chile, Colombia,
Mexico and Peru from 2005 to 2014, encompassing the global ﬁnancial crisis and
aftermath. We also report selected results for the US and Brazil. We obtain
observable factors as the principal components of the term structure itself, and
estimate Nelson–Siegel yield curves for each to provide the necessary synthetic
contracts. The resulting curves allow us to ﬁt afﬁne models in a few seconds and the
complete procedure is extremely easy to automate. To further anticipate our results
we ﬁnd that long-term policy rate expectations are solidly anchored for each of the
four selected countries. This accords with a story of credible monetary policies
linked to well-understood inﬂation targets. Almost all variations in yields are
attributed to variation in term premia.
The present paper is organized as follows. The next section outlines the
collection of methods used, both for yield curve estimation and for the ACM
estimates. Sections 3 and 4 contain our empirical analysis, using Colombian data as
an illustration for the methods before discussing the term premia estimates and their
behavior. A ﬁnal Sect. 5 concludes.

2 Econometric approach
The interesting results here are the estimated term premia, but these are obtained
using a multi-step process. We ﬁrst outline the general approach we use, brieﬂy
describing the Nelson and Siegel (1987) method and then the less familiar afﬁne
model and ACM estimation approach in more detail. Although we need to use a
multi-step approach to generate the required data, each step is conceptually simple
and provides information that is interesting in its own right.
2.1 Nelson–Siegel method
It is often useful to have parsimonious models of yield curves, and there have been a
number of suggested methods. In particular, Nelson and Siegel (1987) proposed an
extremely simple cross-sectional approach to the estimation of yields curves. They

across the available maturity dimension s, and the three terms have become associated with the level, slope and curvature of the yield curve. The four parameters of

In an ideal world (and as suggested by a referee) we would have used selected non-inﬂation targeting
countries as a control group, but data available to us on Bloomberg were of insufﬁciently good quality to
build satisfactory models. Even then, the spillovers from neighbors with ‘good’ monetary policy could
weighted by (inverse) duration. A second curvature term was proposed by Svensson
(1995) and is often used. Diebold and Rudebusch (2013) give an excellent description of this and related methods.
Although we experimented with the Svensson extension the simplest speciﬁcation was easily adequate, so we use Nelson–Siegel curves throughout. This is
¨
similar to Gurkaynak et al. (2007) who use Nelson–Siegel curves for US Treasuries
until the end of 1979 and Svensson curves thereafter. We provide evidence of the ﬁt
below. Once constructed we can then generate yields in any period for any value of
s. Thus for any month-end data, say September 2010, we can calculate implied
contracts for any s and then use the data from end-October for the relevant monthsto-go. Essentially we are able to calculate relative ﬁxed event yields without the
actual data. This is a key input into the ACM estimation procedure that enables us to
price using linear regressions.
2.2 Afﬁne models of yields
Afﬁne models, for example Ang and Piazzesi (2003), make the following
assumptions about what drives the term structure. Each yield curve depends on a
set of factors, Zt , which can be either macro-factors or some implied state variables.
We will assume that these factors can be adequately modeled using a simple ﬁrstorder VAR such as
Ztþ1 ¼ l þ UZt þ vtþ1 ; vtþ1 $ Nð0; RÞ:

ð1Þ

In what follows, the factors are obtained as the principal components of the implied
term structure.
Now we make the important modeling assumptions about how the prices of
bonds are determined. The pricing equations are constructed using the recursive
structure implied by the yield curve itself under the assumption of no-arbitrage, and
are given by
Â
Ã
ð2Þ
Pn ¼ Et Mtþ1 PnÀ1
t
tþ1
where Pn is the price of a discount bond in period t with n periods to go and Mt is a
t
suitable stochastic discount factor. The values of n in effect discretize the durations
above with a unit being the sampling period. In logs, and making the assumption of
log-normal shocks, we can write (2) as
Â

pn ¼ Et mtþ1 þ pnÀ1 þ vart mtþ1 þ ptþ1

ð3Þ

where lower case denotes the log of the upper case equivalent and we use the fact
that if k ¼ ln K, then ln Et ½K ¼ Et ½k þ 1 rk;t .
2
In turn, the stochastic discount factor is deﬁned in logs as
1
1
mtþ1 ¼ Àrt À k0t kt À k0t RÀ2 vtþ1
2

1

kt ¼ RÀ2 ðk0 þ k1 Zt Þ:
As Ang and Piazzesi (2003) and many others discuss, this gives a tractable formulation of the discount factor that has predictable effects, although it is not necessarily consistent with the assumptions we make elsewhere in the model about the
implied form of the discount factor. Log prices themselves are assumed afﬁne in the
state variables
pn ¼ ÀAn À B0n Zt

and equivalently pnÀ1 ¼ ÀAnÀ1 À B0nÀ1 Ztþ1 . This powerful setup allows for time

the yield curve. Equating (3) and (5) given (4) yields

Taking expectations appropriately and dropping the conditionality of the variance

Finally, the short rate is assumed to be

and modeled as

B0n ¼ d01 þ B0nÀ1 ðU À Rk01 Þ:

[(see for example Wickens (2008), Chapter 11]. Prices can be converted easily into
yields, consistent with the Nelson–Siegel curves.
We can also derive the implied risk neutral curves by setting the price of risk
terms k0 and k1 to zero. Thus an equivalent recursion consisting of
1
An ¼ d0 þ AnÀ1 À B0nÀ1 RBnÀ1

ð9Þ

B0n ¼ d01 þ B0nÀ1 U:

ð10Þ

generates the implied expected prices. Again these can be converted into expected
yields and a similar formula gives expected interest rates. These are discussed in
detail in, for example, Joyce et al. (2010). Essentially we need to program up
additional recursions in the same form as (7) and (8) or (9) and (10). As noted in the
introduction the term premium is assumed to be the only source of risk compensation and it is this which allows us to easily back out interest rate expectations.
2.3 The ACM approach
The model above has a number of parameters to estimate, and is often ﬁtted using
maximum likelihood methods under suitable identifying restrictions. As we noted
above, ACM ﬁrst assume that the factors can be observed and estimate the factor
model independently of the other parameters. This will be done by taking principal
components of the term structure itself. Second, they deﬁne the ex-post holdingperiod excess return as

If we can condition on known Z and x then only k and b in (18) need estimating.
ACM suggest taking n principal components of the term structure data and using
these as the Z variables. Additionally we can calculate x from some appropriately
parameterized pricing curves, and, of course, Nelson–Siegel curves are suitable.
ACM suggest a three-step estimation procedure:

This approach is incredibly simple, and can be coded in comparatively few lines.2
More than this, it is many orders of magnitude less expensive to calculate relative to
the maximum likelihood approach, and makes cross-country analysis very
straightforward. In the next section, as way of illustration we apply the methods
step-by-step to Colombian data before comparing the results across countries.

3 Data and yield curve estimation
We use a single country, Colombia, just to illustrate the methods. The results for
each country were very similar. Daily zero coupon benchmark yields were obtained
from Bloomberg for the four countries. We converted these to end-month values
and ﬁtted separate Nelson–Siegel curves to each time period and country. For
example, the data for Colombia for the 3-, 6-, 12-, 24-, 36-, 48-, 60-, 96- and
120-month yields from May 2006 through May 2014 are shown in Fig. 1.
We ﬁt3 Nelson–Siegel curves to the cross sections, and the resulting implied
yields are as shown in Figure 2. These are a remarkably close ﬁt, which justiﬁes the
choice of the simplest Nelson–Siegel speciﬁcation. This gives us all of the implied
contracts for the intermediate periods which can be obtained by appropriate choice
of s. Similar ﬁts are obtained for all four countries.

4 ACM results
We follow the exact three-step procedure adopted by ACM. This requires us to
obtain the principal components, determine an appropriate number to use, calculate
the holding-period excess returns and then ﬁt the k values. From these we can
calculate the implied afﬁne yield curves, term premia, the implied risk neutral
curves and hence interest rate expectations.
4.1 Principal components
For each country we ﬁrst calculate the implied yield curve from three months to ten
years at three-month intervals. We then take the principal components of these to
use as the factors. In general we ﬁnd that we need four factors to ﬁt a near-perfect
afﬁne model in each case. For Colombia these are shown in Fig. 3 and labeled
Component 1–4 for the ﬁrst to fourth component. The components themselves have
2

We coded the procedure in EViews 7.2. This has the advantage of handling the data very well, so that
we can, for example, vary the periodicity of the estimates easily.

4.2 Afﬁne yield curves
Four principal components were used as observed factors for each country, and the
ACM three-step procedure followed.5 The resulting afﬁne models ﬁt the yields quite
satisfactorily. Here we plot three representative cross sections in Fig. 4 for the
Colombian data above in March 2008, December 2010 and December 2012. These
correspond to periods before, during and since the ﬁnancial crisis. The lowest line in
each graph is the implied risk neutral curve where the values of k have been set to
zero and agents are, therefore, not seeking compensation for risk. This can be seen
to deviate in all cases quite sharply from the empirical curves. As should be evident
from these examples this is a very satisfactory ﬁt for an afﬁne model, with the
Colombian model often the worst in terms of pricing errors, and we can replicate a
sequence of individually estimated Nelson–Siegel curves with relatively few
parameters and the principal components.
4.3 Term premia and expected interest rates
It is central to our analysis that the four countries that we study are all inﬂation
targeters, see Hammond (2012). Currently Chile, Colombia and Mexico all have
inﬂation targets of 3 % (within a target band) and Peru has a central target of 2 %.
This generates steady-state predictions for policy rates, as credible inﬂation targets
should be associated with an appropriate long-run nominal interest rate. In particular
we expect longer dated expected nominal interest rate in Peru to be lower than the
5
As suggested by ACM we set the constant (l) in the VAR to zero, which is appropriate for stationary
data. This has a small effect on, for example, the estimated long-run interest rate, but has no effect on the

in the mid-2000 s Mexican and Colombian policy rates were markedly higher than
the other two.
Our sample periods are slightly different for each country which reﬂects data
availability, all ending in May 2014. Chile runs from October 2006, Colombia (as
noted above) from May 2006, Mexico from January 2006 and Peru from May 2006.
This gives around 95 observations per country.6 We now discuss the country results
in turn, where we plot the yield, the term premium and the expected interest rate at
2-, 5- and 10-year horizons for each.
Chile (Fig. 5) has perhaps the least interesting graphs but the most interesting
results; the expected rate asymptotes very quickly to approximately 5 % on an
annual basis. Term premia have markedly declined over the last decade, with some
variation around the ﬁnancial crisis and some evidence that they went negative at
the shortest horizon. The dynamics of the term structure seem to imply unusually
rapid convergence to the long run. However, they are extremely good news for
Chilean monetary policy makers, where long-run interest rate expectations are
strongly anchored in the very near future. Notice that estimated term premia have
recently remained low.
The story is similar in Colombia (Fig. 6), and here it is perhaps more surprising
as interest rates started higher. However, long-term expectations of the policy rate
are solidly anchored, perhaps slightly higher than for Chile, but nonetheless with
little sign of any change throughout the estimation period as can be seen in the
10-year (green) line. The higher yields in the long run for the early years of the
sample are attributed by the model entirely to term premia. We return to the
dynamics of this when we consider correlations with US premia below.
Mexico (Fig. 7) mirrors Colombia; term premia are slightly higher, expected
interest rates slightly lower. There is some evidence of a more elevated term
premium in the recent past, but otherwise the graphs are remarkably similar. Peru
(Fig. 8), with a lower inﬂation target delivers the lowest anticipated future interest
rate as expected, around 4 % rather than the 5 % or more in the other three
countries. Term premia are more volatile, but as with Chile, all movements in the
yields further out are attributable to term premia effects and not interest rate
expectations.
As an additional exercise we controlled for the effects of turbulence in ﬁnancial
markets over the crisis period by shortening the sample period by three years, so that
the samples all begin in 2009. At our monthly frequency this gives around 60
observations on stationary data, enough for reasonable inference. To illustrate the
results, we give the average of the ten-year expected rates in Table 1. Not only are
these the averages, they are also the expected values in every period as ten-year
expectations are extremely ﬂat across the estimation sample. For the three inﬂation
targeters that target inﬂation at 3 % the long-run expected interest rate is

In the majority of cases the yield data used in the estimation is from the last working day of the month.
The exception is a small number of cases for Chile; here the month-end data was either unavailable or
appeared to be entered into Bloomberg incorrectly (i.e., there were random spikes in the three- and sixmonth data which were not present in longer maturity yields). In these cases a day earlier in the month has

approximately 4:4 %. For Peru, targeting inﬂation a percentage point lower, the
expected interest rate is 3:3 % 10 years out. These numbers are lower than for the
full sample by around a percentage point, but are extraordinarily consistent with
each other, suggesting long-run real rates of about 1:5 % in every case. This seems a
little low, and we prefer the full sample estimates, but the message is the same.
Policy rate expectations are extremely well anchored in each case. To sum up;
inﬂation targeting appears to be working very well in these countries.
4.4 Correlations
If interest rate expectations are so well anchored by four entirely independent
monetary policies, it is interesting to ask how the term premia are correlated, both
between themselves and with the US on the assumption that the US is the dominant
ﬁnancial center. Note that the US Federal Reserve reacted strongly to a domestic
and then global ﬁnancial crisis with a variety of conventional and unconventional
means. For convenience we plot all four of our estimated ten-year term premia
together with the equivalent US term premia obtained from Adrian et al. (2014) in
Fig. 9.
Inspecting the levels of the term premia gives us an interesting insight into recent
developments. Note that all term premia fell in early 2012, with Chile and the US

sharp rise in term premia is detectable everywhere except for Chile. It seems likely
that the fall is associated with turbulence in the Euro area, with considerable worries
about the possibility of sovereign debt default there and the search for alternatives.
The rise in 2013 coincides with the announcement of possible tapering by the US
Federal Reserve.
In Table 2 we show the correlation of the two-year term premia estimates between
our selected countries as well as with the US and Brazil over the maximum available
sample periods. We include Brazil, a further Latin American inﬂation targeter.
However, Brazil has a much higher inﬂation target (4.5 %) with wider tolerance bands
and is perceived to have been less successful in achieving the target than the four main
cases we consider (see De Pooter et al. 2014).7 At this horizon Mexican and
particularly Colombian term premia are signiﬁcantly positively correlated with US
term premia. Brazilian term premia also turn out to be strongly positively correlated
with the US. This complements the narrative in Guarn et al. (2014), who point to a
negative correlation between Colombian and US yields; our numbers suggest the term
premia remained positively correlated. The observed negative correlation in yields
seems to be driven entirely by interest rate expectations.
This pattern is also evident at the 10-year horizon (Table 3). However, it is also
apparent that both Chilean and Peruvian term premia are largely uncorrelated with
the US at the ten-year horizon and even perhaps negatively correlated at the 2-year
one. Unsurprisingly, a case can be made that neighboring countries seem more
correlated at all horizons and there is a clear ranking in correlation with the US.8

Chile in particular seems different; term premia there have not recovered since 2011
which explains the decreasing correlation with the US.
It is also the case that over particular periods of stress there turns out to be
stronger correlation with the US. This is evident from Fig. 10 where we plot 2-year
rolling correlations of the 10-year term premia with the US. From 2010 onward
Colombia was temporarily much more correlated with the US but has recently
returned to previous values. Chile has been much less correlated with the US as term
premia have not responded to US monetary conditions.
Taken together the results seem to indicate that there was relatively little impact
on longer term expectations from the ﬁnancial crisis for the Latin American
economies that we study. There was considerable variation in the term premia over
this period, but except for Mexico, term premia seem a great deal lower post-crisis.

ACM model attributes them entirely to reduced term premia. Increased term premia
in the US since the onset of anticipated tapering seem to have raised term premia
everywhere except Chile. But in none of the countries we study have there been
apparent ﬂuctuations in long-term inﬂation expectations and hence equilibrium
nominal interest rates. Why have Chilean term premia failed to respond to the recent
upturn? Ceballos et al. (2014) estimate term premia using the method suggested by
Joslin et al. (2014) which are very similar to ours. They present some VAR
evidence that Chilean premia are sensitive to US ones. However, they too document
the lack of recent correlation. The apparent success of Chile in decoupling from US
term premia suggest an avenue for future study.

5 Conclusions
We use the empirical approach due to ACM to estimate dynamic term structure
models for four Latin American countries (Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru). To
our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst time this methodology has been applied to a cross
section of Latin American countries. Using estimated coefﬁcients from the widely
used Nelson–Siegel term structure model, we generate synthetic bond-price
contracts and use them to calculate a set of principal components. From these,
we can calculate the implied afﬁne yield curves and decompose them into implied
term premia and interest rate expectations. Our results point towards stable long-run
interest rate expectations, with movements in term premia accounting for most of
the observed variation in yields. Term premia in all four countries have declined
since 2006, despite the onset of the global ﬁnancial crisis in 2008. We ﬁnd evidence
of a comovement of term premia across the four countries for the longer dated
securities. While there is some comovement of term premia with the US, the
dominant effect seems to be domestic monetary policy, which may well be due to
the inﬂation targeting framework employed by the central banks in all four
countries.
