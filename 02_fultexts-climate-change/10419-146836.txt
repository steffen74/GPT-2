ample and growing evidence that intangible resources such as knowledge, know-how
and social capital will prove to be the coal, oil, and diamonds of the twenty-first century
for developed, developing, and emerging economies alike.1 Moreover, there are strong
indications and emerging trends that there are qualitative and quantitative differences
between the twentieth and the twenty-first century drivers of economic growth.2
Specifically, technology and knowledge have become the key factors of production;
knowledge is now the basic form of capital. Economic growth is driven by the accumulation of knowledge, and new technological developments create technical platforms
for further innovations. These technical platforms are, in turn, drivers of economic
growth. Technology raises the return on investment. Information and Communications
Technologies (ICTs) facilitate human exchange, particularly commercial and political
transactions, which in turn, develop the base of knowledge capital and raise the stakes
for attaining and sustaining competitiveness in global markets.
Our working definition for the knowledge economy (KE) is as follows:
 ‚ÄúThe Knowledge Economy is a state of economic being and a process of economic

becoming that leverages intensively and extensively knowledge assets and
competences as well as economic learning to catalyze and accelerate sustainable
and robust economic growth‚Äù.3
Our working definition of Cyber-Development (an alternate, earlier term being
e-Development) is as follows:
 Cyber-Development is a set of tools, methodologies, and practices that leverage

ICT to catalyze and accelerate social, political, and economic development or in
other words, Cyber-Development is information-and-communication technology(ICT)-enabled and knowledge-economy-(KE)-inspired development that may enable
the economies of developing and especially transitioning countries to become
knowledge economies. This also applies to the advanced economies (Carayannis
et al. 2014). Here, Cyber-Development also cross-refers to Cyber-Democracy
(Campbell and Carayannis 2014).
Advanced democracies or democracies of a high quality are also a ‚Äúknowledge
democracy‚Äù. This draws a connection in co-evolution between knowledge democracy
and knowledge economy. One underlying understanding here is that knowledge, knowledge creation, knowledge production, and knowledge application (innovation) behave
as crucial drivers for enhancing democracy, society, and the economy (Carayannis and
Campbell 2014). Knowledge democracy fosters and excels innovation, and the interplay
of knowledge and innovation enables, supports, and carries sustainable development.
Between political pluralism in democracy and the diversity and heterogeneity of knowledge in a knowledge society and knowledge economy, there operates a congruence in
structures and processes. Knowledge democracy does not only apply to industrialized
countries, but offers, in principle, also important references for developing democracies, the newly industrialized countries and emerging markets. The implication of
‚ÄúCyber-Democracy‚Äù is to look at knowledge democracy from the perspective of a
globally evolving knowledge society in configurations of a multi-level architecture


(global, trans-national, supra-national, national, sub-national, and local). Ramifications
of Cyber-Democracy are as follows: (1) the networking opportunities and capabilities
of interaction and communication increase; (2) the volume of codified knowledge
cumulates, and the possibilities to access (publicly access) this knowledge also
improve; (3) digitalized (electronic) information and knowledge, and the world-wide
web, created a network-style fundament and infrastructure of knowledge, allowing a
knowledge conversion of the local into the global (gloCal) and vice versa, resulting
in a gloCal platform for communication and knowledge interaction and knowledge
enhancement. How does Cyber-Democracy relate to Cyber-Development and CyberDefense? Cyber-Democracy raises challenges for governance and of governance and
the next steps of further development of society and democracy (see furthermore:
Campbell and Carayannis 2013 and Campbell and Carayannis 2014; Carayannis and
Campbell 2009, 2010, 2012; Carayannis et al. 2014; Umpleby 1990; Wiener 1948).

Introduction: the point of departure of the analysis
Developed and developing economies alike face increased resource scarcity and
competitive rivalry. Science and technology increasingly appear as a main source of
competitive and sustainable advantage for nations and regions alike (Carayannis and
Papadopoulos 2011). However, the key determinant of their efficacy is the quality and
quantity of entrepreneurship-enabled innovation that unlocks and captures the pecuniary benefits of the science enterprise in the form of private, public, or hybrid goods (for
instance, bio-entrepreneur-millionaires, knowledge for the public good, i.e. public health
awareness, and new public‚Äìprivate research centers funded partly by bio-entrepreneurmillionaires and monies levied as taxes on bio-ventures).
Entrepreneurship and Innovation are human endeavors and socioeconomic phenomena that are intrinsic to human nature as well as constitute both social and political
engines of positive change and growth provided they are balanced and guided by effective and transparent regulatory and incentive systems in place.
Current local, regional, and global economic and financial conditions and trends
make the need to trigger, catalyze, and accelerate high quantity and quality entrepreneurial initiatives that are based on high quality and quantity innovations (low-tech,
medium-tech, and high-tech) even more clear and present as this is one of the major
ways and means to target and achieve real, sustainable, and eventually accelerating
GNP growth. Such growth is much more likely to come from new and qualitative different and superior initiatives (from ‚Äúsunrise‚Äù industries) rather than re-structuring existing (and perhaps ‚Äúsunset‚Äù) industries. It may be strategically more prudent to invest
scarce and precious resources in carefully calculated strategic ‚Äúbets‚Äù rather than keep
throwing them after waning industrial sectors and declining firms and in that sense, it
may be best to provide aggressive socioeconomic re-training, re-insertion, and/or early
retirement programs to allow for real growth strategies to be implemented.
Moreover, we believe that the concepts of robust competitiveness and sustainable
entrepreneurship (Carayannis 2008) are pillars of a regime called ‚Äúdemocratic capitalism‚Äù (Carayannis and Kaloudis 2010) (as opposed to ‚Äúpopular or casino capitalism‚Äù),
where real opportunities for education and economic prosperity are available to all and
especially the younger people (but not only).



This would be the direct derivative of a collection of top-down policies as well as
bottom-up initiatives (including strong R&D policies and funding but going beyond
that to the development of innovation networks and knowledge clusters across regions
and sectors; see Carayannis and Campbell 2006a):
We define sustainable entrepreneurship (Carayannis 2008) as the creation of viable,
profitable, and scalable firms. Such firms engender the formation of self-replicating
and mutually enhancing innovation networks and knowledge clusters (innovation
ecosystems) leading towards robust competitiveness.
We understand robust competitiveness (Carayannis 2008) as a state of economic
being and becoming that avails but also questions systematic and defensible ‚Äúunfair
advantages‚Äù to the entities that are part of the economy. Such competitiveness is built
on mutually complementary and reinforcing low, medium, and high technology, public
and private sector entities (government agencies, private firms, universities, and nongovernmental organizations).4
Existing and new small and medium enterprises (SMEs) that can provide better
solutions for less will always be winners (even and perhaps especially in down markets
and recessionary economic cycle stages), and this is the area where fiscal, monetary,
institutional, intellectual property rights (IPR)-related, and other public‚Äìprivate sectors
programs and initiatives are needed to help unlock, capture, and leverage fully the
value-adding potential of the knowledge creation infrastructure (i.e., universities,
research institutions, and private sector research and development R&D facilities) by
providing incentives and establishing a large number, scale, and scope of pilots
connecting organically and effectively all stages of the value-adding knowledge chain
(from the lab to the market via world-class SMEs that will be both locally as well as
globally oriented by design and the new ones from their inception).

Innovation as development
‚ÄúDiscovery consists of looking at the same thing as everyone else and thinking
something different‚Äù.
Albert Szent-Gyorgyi‚ÄîNobel Prize Winner
Innovation is a word derived from the Latin, meaning to introduce something new to
the existing realm and order of things or to change the yield of resources as stated by
J.B. Say quoted in Drucker (Drucker 1985).
In addition, innovation is often linked with creating a sustainable market around the
introduction of new and superior product or process. Specifically, in the literature on
the management of technology, technological innovation is characterized as the introduction of a new technology-based product into the market:
‚ÄúTechnological innovation is defined here as a situationally new development through
which people extend their control over the environment. Essentially, technology is a
tool of some kind that allows an individual to do something new. A technological
innovation is basically information organized in a new way. So technology transfer
amounts to the communication of information, usually from one organization to
another.‚Äù (Tornazky and Fleischer 1990).



The broader interpretation of the term ‚Äúinnovation‚Äù refers to an innovation as an
‚Äúidea, practice, or material artifact‚Äù (Rogers and Shoemaker 1971, p. 19) adopted by a
person or organization, where that artifact is ‚Äúperceived to be new by the relevant unit
of adoption‚Äù (Zaltman et al. 1973). Therefore, innovation tends to change perceptions
and relationships at the organizational level, but its impact is not limited there.
Innovation in its broader socio-technical, economic, and political context can also
substantially impact, shape, and evolve ways and means people live their lives, businesses form, compete, succeed, and fail, and nations prosper or decline. What results is
an ‚Äúinnovation ecosystem‚Äù (Carayannis and Campbell 2009), which may also be
portrayed in terms of an ‚Äúinnovation landscape‚Äù (see Fig. 1).
Specifically, Fig. 2 attempts to illustrate the nature and dynamics of an emerging
globalization framework in which creativity and innovation (as enabler of technological
effort in manufacturing and as an engine of industrial development) can lead to
improved competitiveness and sustained development. On the other hand, lack of
creativity and innovation constitutes a factor for failure in manufacturing performance
and, as a result, is a factor for failure in economic performance, too. For those
countries in which creativity and innovation is applied effectively, globalization can be
an engine of beneficial and sustainable economic integration. However, globalization
can be a powerful force for deprivation, inequality, marginalization, and economical
disruption in those non-competitive countries.
Government or market success or failure is determined by how they take advantage
of the four major elements that shape the setting for creativity, innovation, and
competitiveness in the globalized world: (1) The coordination and synergy in the
relationship between governments, enterprises, research laboratories and other specialized bodies, universities, and support agencies for small and medium enterprises
(SMEs); (2) the power of information and communication technology; (3) the efficiency
that managerial and organizational systems can bring to production and commerce;

Fig. 2 Twenty-first century innovation ecosystem (Carayannis and Kaloudis, Diversity in the Knowledge
Economy and Society, Edward Elgar, May 2008)

and (4) the international agreements, rules and regulations. All the four elements of
this framework will impact on creativity and innovation at the micro level (firm level)
as well as on innovation and competitiveness at the macro level (industry, national,
global).
From a business perspective, an innovation is perceived as the happy ending of the
commercialization journey of an invention, when that journey is indeed successful and
leads to the creation of a sustainable and flourishing market niche or new market (see
Carayannis et al. 2003). Therefore, a technical discovery or invention (the creation of
something new) is not significant to a company unless that new technology can be
utilized to add value to the company, through increased revenues, reduced cost, and
similar improvements in financial results. This has two important consequences for the
analysis of any innovation in the context of a business organization.
First, an innovation must be integrated into the operations and strategy of the
organization, so that it has a distinct impact on how the organization creates value or
on the type of value the organization provides in the market.
Second, an innovation is a social process, since it is only through the intervention
and management of people that an organization can realize the benefits of an
innovation.
In much of the foregoing discussion, a recurring theme about innovation is that of
uncertainty, leading to the conclusion that an effective model of innovation must
include a multidimensional approach (uncertainty is defined as unknown unknowns
whereas risk is defined as known knowns) (Carayannis et al. 2003). One model posited
as an aide to understanding is the Multidimensional Model of Innovation (MMI)
(Cooper 1998). This model attempts to define the understanding of innovation by



establishing three-dimensional boundaries. The planes are defined as product-process,
incremental-radical, and administrative-technical. The product-process boundary concerns itself with the end product and its relationship to the methods employed by firms to
produce and distribute the product. Incremental-radical defines the degree of relative
strategic change that accompanies the diffusion of an innovation. This is a measure of the
disturbance or disequilibrium in the market. Technological-administrative boundaries
refer to the relationship of innovation change to the firm‚Äôs operational core. The use of
technological refers to the influences on basic firm output while the administrative
boundary would include innovations affecting associated factors of policy, resources, and
social aspects of the firm.

Innovation posture, propensity, and performance

We develop our conceptual model of organizational innovation from a resource-based
perspective of the firm (Penrose 1959; Barney 1991). In particular, we draw upon the
concept of knowledge as an intangible resource that flows throughout organizations to
render new routines, technologies, or structures that affect future performance (Nelson
and Winter 1982). In order to capture the multi-layered influence of organizational
innovation, we conceive our framework for innovation routines as a procedural model.
We focus on intangible resources that contribute inputs to the innovation process. We
examine the firm‚Äôs capabilities for engaging in innovating activities and finally consider
the range of organizational outputs from innovation that spans short-horizon outcomes
to long-horizon lasting impacts.
This composite of measures is housed within a ‚Äú3P‚Äù framework for organizational
innovation. Innovation emerges from three critical firm-level factors: posture, propensity, and performance (Carayannis and Provance 2007).5
‚ÄúPosture‚Äù refers to an organization‚Äôs position within the greater innovation system of
its environment (i.e., region, industry, technological domain). Specifically, posture
comprises a firm‚Äôs state along three dimensions: the organizational, technological and
market lifecycles, reflecting its readiness to both engage in and benefit from innovation
(Damanpour 1991). It thus identifies the conditions influencing a specific firm within a
specific technology regime serving a specific market.
Each firm‚Äôs ability to engage in innovative activities will be constrained by its posture,
which is exogenous to the innovation process being measured. That is, regardless of
whether and what type of innovation process is employed, a firm exists at a point in its
lifecycle from formation to failure (organizational lifecycle). The firm also selects technologies to employ in the implementation of its strategies and thus is subject to the state of the
technology regime lifecycle within which these technologies exist (technological lifecycle).
For example, a handful of stagecoach companies continued operation for a period of
time after the introduction of the automobile and thus their place in the stagecoach
technology regime could be measured. Finally, the firm exists on a competitive landscape within significant strategic activities in one or more markets. These markets exist
at various points in their own lifecycle; therefore they also constrain the innovative
actions available to the firm.
‚ÄúPropensity‚Äù is a firm‚Äôs ability to capitalize on its posture based on cultural acceptance
of innovation. In this way, propensity is an intangible reflection of processes, routines,



and capabilities established within a firm. A firm may possess adequate resources and
consequently higher externalized innovation stature, yet have an underdeveloped
capacity for innovation due to cultural or other constraints.
‚ÄúPerformance‚Äù is the lasting result of innovation. This part of the framework
comprises three levels: output, outcome, and impact. Outputs occur as the immediate,
internalized results of innovation. New product introductions, patents, and technology
transfer licenses are among the outputs that emerge. Outcomes include mid-range
results such as revenues contributed by new products. Finally, impacts represent more
lasting, long-range benefits that accrue to the firm from its innovative competence and
are transformed into results for the firm‚Äôs environment too. Examples of impact
performance include status as a top innovator in the industry.
All three factors (posture, propensity, and performance) are captured empirically in
the form of a combinatorial we define as the Composite Innovation Index (CII). This
comprehensive measure demonstrates the superior evaluative results of measuring
innovation across all facets of its process in concert (Damanpour 1991).

Development as democracy
Technology changes the way society functions. The dramatic advances in technology
over recent decades have collaterally precipitated wide sweeping and profound change
to the functioning of almost every form of human exchange, the world over (Carayannis
et al. 2006; Carayannis et al. 2014). What emerged in developed economies during the
latter years of the twentieth century is knowledge-based economics‚Äîan evolutionary
framework of social transaction that now dominates the behavior of mankind in the
twenty-first century.

The conceptual framework of knowledge economy

‚ÄúFor countries in the vanguard of the world economy, the balance between knowledge
and resources has shifted so far towards the former that knowledge has become
perhaps the most important factor determining the standard of living‚Äîmore than land,
than tools, than labour. Today‚Äôs most technologically advanced economies are truly
knowledge-based.‚Äù‚ÄîWorld Development Report, 1999.
In classical economics, land, labor, and capital are the only factors of production:
‚ÄúKnowledge, productivity, education, and intellectual capital are all regarded as exogenous factors, falling outside the system‚Äù (Singh 2010, p. 2).6 The New Growth Theory
recognizes two additional factors: technology and the knowledge on which it is based.
In today‚Äôs environment, technology and knowledge are not merely additional factors of
production; they have become the key factors of production. Knowledge is the basic
form of capital. Economic growth is driven by the accumulation of knowledge and new
technological developments create technical platforms for further innovations. These
technical platforms, in turn, are drivers of economic growth. Technology raises the
return on investment, which is why developed countries can sustain growth and why
developing economies cannot attain growth without it. Even with unlimited labor,
natural resources, and ample capital, traditional economics predicts that there are
diminishing returns on investment. New Growth theorists argue that the non-rivalry
and technical platform effects of new technology can lead to increasing rather than



diminishing returns on technological investment.7 Investment can make technology
more valuable and vice versa. The cycle that results can raise a country‚Äôs growth rate
permanently‚Äîwhich contradicts traditional economics.
Earning monopoly rents on discoveries is important to provide incentive to invest in
R&D for technological innovation. This is why protection of Intellectual Property
Rights (IPR) is fundamental to growth and traditional economics sees ‚Äúperfect competition‚Äù as the ideal (Ramasami 2011, p. 25).8 Enhancing human capital is critical for GDP
growth, as well.9 To make investments in technology, a country must have sufficient
human capital. Human capital is defined as the formal education, training, and on-thejob learning embodied in the workforce.
‚ÄúA knowledge-driven economy is one in which the generation and exploitation of
knowledge play the predominant part in the creation of wealth‚Äù (UK Department of
Trade and Industry 1998). In contrast, during the industrial era, machines replacing
human labor created wealth. Nowadays, many people associate the knowledge economy
with high-technology industries such as telecommunications and financial services.
Actually, knowledge workers are workers who manipulate symbols rather than machines.
Architects, bank workers, fashion designers, pharmaceutical researchers, teachers, and
policy analysts are all examples of knowledge workers. For knowledge workers, knowwhy and know-who matters more than know-what. Knowledge gained by experience is as
important as formal education and training‚Äïlifelong learning is vital for organizations
and individuals and its intellectual capital is a firm‚Äôs source of competitive advantage.
The knowledge-based economy can be characterized as fractal. It is non-linear,
unstable, and stochastic (Carayannis 2007, p. 32; Routti 2003).10 Like chaos theory,
simple algorithms iterated successively yield very complex patterns and interrelationships, as epitomized by the butterfly flapping its wings in the Amazon to trigger a
hurricane over the Atlantic months later. The knowledge-based economy creates profit
avalanches. Entrance is easy for small, intelligent companies, but there is no space for
organic growth; the market is instantly global and a newcomer can attain dominance in
10 years. It also differentiates itself by the convergence of technologies, which removes
market sector boundaries: wireless, satellite, cable, and telecom no longer belong to
discrete sectors. In a mobile information society, services as well are different, impacted
by the presence of Internet, virtual organization, or network transactions. Information
and communication technologies (ICTs) are enablers of change; they release creative
potential and knowledge and open up global markets and foster competition. Network
transaction economies resemble the most complex network: the human brain (Routti
2003). The digital revolution can be a great equalizer, but national policies must be
right to enable it. Proper training and education can make a network transaction
economy, or knowledge economy, more effective and efficient: smarter. This elevation
requires methodical enhancement of the business development environment, e.g., via
business incubators. Advancement also requires enhancement of the network technology infrastructure, i.e., ICT. The state of the art is the virtual incubator, in which ICT
extends and multiplies the effectiveness of business incubation at lower cost.
Regardless of externalities, each organization seeks to sustain itself in competition
and cooperation with other entities that depend on the same finite pool of resources
(Carayannis et al. 2006). The fundamental challenge is the very heart of economic
discipline: The management and allocation of scarce resources.



The advantage of the knowledge economy is that knowledge grows by sharing‚Äî
donors do not forfeit what they know when passing knowledge to recipients, who in
turn can share with others. The greatest phenomenon of knowledge-based economics is this multiplier effect: Sharing knowledge capital actually creates more of it.
Public policy

Governments have not surrendered their power to capitalism, even if the world‚Äôs
biggest companies are more powerful than many of the world‚Äôs governments. Democracy is not a sham. People rule, not profits. Admittedly though, companies would run
the world for profit if they could. What stops them is not governments, but markets.
Economic parity arrives when technology allows people to pursue their own goals and
they are given the liberty to do so (Carayannis et al. 2006). If technology can support
trade across borders, and people choose to trade across borders, integration occurs.
Because people have freely chosen it, the outcome is accepted, and because a free market is self-equilibrating, the trade precipitates economic benefits as well. Government
must have a long-term commitment to building a market economy and defending the
mechanisms and protections in which a free market thrives (see once more Routti
2003).
Public practice

Technology-enabled free trade is an economic equalizer. Governments have power, but
they do not always exercise it wisely (Carayannis et al. 2006). They are unreliable
servants of the public interest. But limited government is not worth buying. Markets
keep the spoils of corruption small. Government that intervenes vigorously is worth a
great deal. Especially in developing countries with weak legal systems, taming capitalism by regulation or trade protection often proves such a hazardous endeavor.
Central strategic planning works best from a demand-side intervention, enacting and
enforcing regulations that enable people to get what they want, while protecting society
from harmful, wasteful, or unfair practices.
Historically, what fails is central planning of supply-side regulations that specify what
people may have, through prohibitions and licensing, by creating surpluses and shortages, or by setting quotas and prices to influence commerce and trade.
Distributed tactical planning works best under the control of the entrepreneurs,
organizations (also of civil society), and actors operating in a free-market system.
Government and NGOs function best when serving as facilitators and resources, not as
managers and operators. If national governments or NGOs disable markets, the
economic consequences can be dire, with direct spillover into political and social
consequences. Governments must build trans-national bridges of collaboration and
cooperation, with immediate and long-term long commitment to building a marketoriented economy unimpeded by traditional boundaries.
Private policy

Research and innovation must be managed today to secure sustainability for tomorrow
(Carayannis et al. 2006). Companies must manage intellectual property to manage
research: they need to access external IP; they need to profit from internal IP.



Researchers must be knowledge brokers as well as knowledge generators. Companies can
profit from one another‚Äôs IP. No one company has claim to all the smart people in a field.
Competition and collaboration can and must co-exist. Open innovation is knowledge
diffusion and recombination, producing the ‚Äúseed corn‚Äù of tomorrow‚Äôs breakthroughs.
Researchers must recognize their own potential and be able to articulate possibilities to a
receptive management for further development (see Chesbrough 2001).
Science-driven academic research is vital to returns. Scientists decide the basic
research; industrialists decide the applied R&D. Management culture must encourage
risk-taking. Fear of failure suppresses creativity and innovation, which undermines
competitiveness. Failure is a great educator. Institutionally, a deviation from plan is an
irregularity, but competitively it is creative, innovative, exploratory work. Creativity is
essential (see again Routti 2003).
There is tremendous ‚Äúwhite space‚Äù in market opportunities: new products, new processes, new markets, and new unknowns. Strategic community creation is a calculated
alliance of many stakeholders to manage the white-space risk and facilitate adoption.

Private practice

The priorities of new venture formation in the knowledge economy are the following:
ICT and Internet access; linkages to investors and lenders; formation of lean management and advisory boards comprised of experienced individuals, competent in their
fields of discipline and having as few members as needed to get the job done; and
planning and securing facilities.
The priorities of e-Development and sustained growth are the following: the ability to
evaluate and react to risk well; protection of product; stimulation of existing market;
the available population of skilled knowledge workers‚Äîwhether centralized in a
physical facility or linked via virtual organization.
All knowledge workers must have access to the Internet and competency in its use,
ample training in computer literacy in addition to their specific technical expertise, and
basic computer, math, and language skills. Firms must practice ongoing training to keep
skills current; competitive advantage is volatile and requires constant reinforcement.

Income inequality
Income inequality in the US has being growing since the late 1970s, but easy credit and
rising asset prices had allowed American households to increase financial leverage to
finance consumption. ‚ÄúLet them eat credit‚Äù is how Raghuram Rajan summarizes how
the political establishment dealt with the growing income inequality in America as he
explains how income inequality is a fundamental cause of the current crisis in his book
Fault Lines. With the mortgage crisis and the end of easy credit, the fractures in the
economy were exposed. Just as Prof. Rajan, now an increasing number of academics
and intellectuals recognize that the growing income inequality is one of the key aspects
behind the financial crash.
Along those lines, this article also argues that reducing income inequality is a key
part of the long-term resolution of this type of crisis. It explores the effects of income
re-distribution on businesses‚Äô innovative behavior, which is essential to helping spark
and sustain economic growth.



Income distribution, the markets, and firm‚Äôs innovation

The first step in understanding how the income re-distribution can lead to innovation
and help an economy move from a stagnant state into a new sustainable economic
growth path is to understand how long-term trends in rising and falling income
inequality affect the market environment that firms must survive in.
In that regard, observe that multinational enterprises (MNEs) are generally good at
adapting to different market conditions around the globe to explore their knowledgebased assets and to create new knowledge-based assets through innovation. Campino
(2010) demonstrates that country income-level variations do impact foreign direct
investments of MNEs, and that in particular MNEs‚Äô foreign direct investments behave
in a manner that is consistent with that expected of high income elasticity of demand
producers (i.e., luxury goods producers).

Preliminary empirical validation

At the macro level, innovation can translate into both top-down policies for a more
efficient allocation of discretionary resources and a bottom-up increasing level of entrepreneurship. In addition, the type of regime under which a country operates can act as
a catalyst or inhibitor of this process (see Fig. 3).
At the firm level, innovation can be expressed in different ways depending on the
time horizon. In the short term, firm exhibit innovativeness; in the medium term, they
exhibit different levels of innovative performance and in the long-term, different levels
of innovative competence (Carayannis and Provance 2007). Both development and
innovation are multidimensional concepts that cannot be easily captured in a single
measure.

Conclusions
Adam Smith defined land, labor, and capital as the key input factors of the economy in
the eighteenth century. Joseph Schumpeter added technology and entrepreneurship as
two more key input factors in the early twentieth century (Carayannis 2007). He thus
recognized the role and dynamic nature of technological change and innovation as well

Fig. 3 Democracy, Innovation Development (DID) Linkages


as path dependencies in shaping the health and future of the economy and moving
away from the static approach of neoclassical economics.
In the late twentieth and the beginning of the twenty-first century, numerous scholars
and practitioners such as Peter Drucker have identified knowledge as perhaps the sixth
and most important key input and output factor of economic activity (Carayannis 2007;
Carayannis and Sipp 2006). We would like to also emphasize the role and significance
of technological and economic learning as a driver of productivity gains and an accelerator of economic growth and prosperity (Carayannis 1993; 1994; 1997; 1998; 1999;
2000; 2001; Drejir 2002).
The e-Development towards the knowledge economy, attempts to address the following
issues:
(1) How could one develop more effective and efficient mechanisms to identify,
capture, and disseminate critical success and failure factors and findings from ongoing
e-Development interventions to enable policymaker and practitioners to shape, evolve,
and implement ‚Äúsmarter‚Äù e-Development strategies in real time?
(2) Namely, how could the most timely, appropriate, and critical e-Development
priorities, objectives, and goals be integrated in a strategic context of e-Development
sequence, selection, and timing choices?
In this sense, our analysis should be of interest and use to both public sector policymakers, private sector practitioners and policymakers, non-governmental organizations,
and academics and students of development, and the role that technology can play
towards catalyzing and accelerating more sustainable, equitable, and effective development interventions.
Comparing and contrasting our analysis of the development cases across developed,
transitioning, and developing economies, we note a number of points partly corroborated by earlier conceptual and empirical research. The study and analysis of these, and
similar cases, of e-Development towards the knowledge economy may provide a
conceptual framework that could serve as an integrative bridge between macro-, meso-,
and micro-economic development ideas and themes.
The overarching goal would be to attain the right socio-technical congruence between
e-Development intervention and the type and stage of development the targeted economy is in bearing in mind the dynamic nature of both e-Development interventions
and the economies they aim to advance. In other words, one could identify optimal
practices and pathways in economic development in terms of selection, sequencing, and
timing decisions undergirding e-Development interventions in order to attain a more
functional alignment between the social, economic, and technological dimensions of
the e-Development intervention and the readiness for e-Development (e-Readiness) of
the targeted economy or sectors thereof.
Functional alignment implies that an e-Development intervention is designed in such
a manner, targeted at such an entry point(s) in the economy and society, and at such a
time, that the optimal configuration of critical success factors (buy-in from key stakeholders, awareness, availability, affordability and accessibility of technology, educational/health/social status of targeted social groups, and support from public and
private partners in the form of public-private partnerships (PPP) among several others)
will augur strongly in favor of the success of the e-Development intervention in terms
of both outcomes and impacts (Carayannis 2014).



Does innovation represent a ‚Äúhappy accident‚Äù which allows for new opportunities
and perspectives of development of knowledge economy in democracy?

Methods
The article follows the attempt and logic of reconstructing (by this designing) key
elements of the current discourses on innovation, but also to provide assessment for
