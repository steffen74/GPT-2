There is an old saying among economists, possibly apocryphal, and of unclear
attribution: ‘‘throughout history there have been only four kinds of economies in the
world: advanced, developing, Japan, and Argentina’’.
This idea can be more concretely grasped by looking at evidence on the long run
levels of income per capita in a broad range of countries over the last two centuries
in Fig. 1. Material living standards have advanced across the entire world, but the

well-known Great Divergence is quite apparent. A few rich countries have become
much richer; a larger group of poorer countries have grown more slowly average.
Within each group are notable exceptions, with some very poor countries making
little progress at all. However, most striking is those countries witnessing a reversal
of fortune, moving from one group to the other.
The set of once-poor countries that are now rich include Japan, where the
transition began more than 100 years ago, and some other East Asian countries such
as Korea and Taiwan, whose transition started only 50 years ago and is now almost
complete. But going the other way there is only one notable case of a country that
started life relatively rich and ended up comparatively poor: this is the great puzzle
or paradox of Argentina. In the late nineteenth century, it was among the top ﬁve
countries in income per capita, richer than all European countries except Britain and
on a par with other rich settler societies such as the United States, Canada, and
Australia. Its status among the richest economies reached a peak around 1913 when
income convergence stopped. But even until 1929 it still clung on in this club, only
to face a slow and widening relative decline thereafter. It is now close to the average
country in the world given its level of income per capita, and its citizens enjoy only
40% of the average income per capita of the 12 core countries of Western Europe.
1.1 ‘‘MicroExplanations’’: trade and investment
In a complementary chapter by Lucas Llach in this volume, written with a different
focus, some important background is developed for the topics explored here. Llach
discusses how the prosperity of Argentina in the circa 1913–1929 period was
potentially fragile and thus vulnerable to reversal: the pre-1914 boom had been
narrowly built on the physical capital of railways and the cereal lands of the pampas
they made viable, but the potential for broader growth via industrial and human
capital was constrained. On wider human development measures, including
schooling and health, Argentina lagged its rich country rivals, and on a regional

surrounding province. Such were the peculiar initial economic conditions in
Argentina circa 1929.
To complement those ﬁndings, this chapter looks elsewhere, and in two different
directions: it looks back to some of the theories of historical ‘‘deep determinants’’
and how they might relate to Argentina’s malaise; and it steps forward to look at the
evolving story after the Great Depression with these initial conditions kept in mind.
I explore some of the main contours of the Argentina ‘‘macropuzzle’’ as the great
divergence in per capita incomes emerged and then widened after 1929, and look at
some of the quantitative explanations that have been advanced for it, in particular,
the central roles played by barriers to trade and investment.
There are many of these (and other) distortions in Argentina—perhaps too many
for the tastes of economists easily seduced by monocausal explanations tied to a toy
model with a minimum of parameters. But we are in a country with an untidy
economic history: in economic policy terms, it is a place where almost anything that
could go wrong has, at some time, actually gone wrong. In this weirdest of historical
laboratories, dozens of strange economic policy experiments have been run in the
last 200 years, often for long periods, and not infrequently with lasting
consequences. Still, in sum, a focus on some key ‘‘microexplanations’’ can help
us to understand a lot of what went wrong at the nexus of public policy and
economic performance.
1.2 ‘‘Macropuzzles’’: elusive deep determinants?
Yet beyond the search for immediate causes, of equal or greater concern to some
economists has been the search for so-called ‘‘deep determinants’’ of economic
outcomes, consisting of causally—and often temporally—distant factors that might
be placed as primal or exogenous factors which ‘‘explain’’ the proximate cause and,
hence, the ultimate outcome of economic underperformance. Among the most
widely cited explanations are a country’s geography (including land/resource
endowments as well as climate/disease environment), its colonial experience, and
the origins of its legal system.
We shall review each of these explanations as applied to the Argentine case, and
ﬁnd that, in contrast to many other countries, most of these explanations do not ﬁt
all that well. For example, Argentina is a predominantly temperate country, it has
been dominated by European settlement, it has maintained high literacy despite the
inequality, and its legal origins are a peculiar hybrid of common and civil law ideas.
Thus, in the debate over the causes of economic success and failure, Argentina
stands as an exception to many of the rules which seem to apply elsewhere,
deepening the mystery.
This contrast leaves us with the ‘‘macropuzzles’’: we have much work left to do
to piece together a plausible story not only of what went wrong, but why it went
wrong. What were the political economy mechanisms that derailed Argentina in the
twentieth century? A century ago, despite some bumps in the road, the country was
prosperous and literate, in a temperate zone, economically open, had reasonably

liberal constitutional democracy. It was not so unlike the other settler countries.
Today, a century later, it looks very different.
1.3 The explicandum
In the two main sections of the paper that follow we look at some commonly
discussed proximate factors behind Argentina’s relative economic decline. We
attempt to put these factors in some kind of empirical perspective and evaluate how
much they might have contributed to Argentina’s economic slow down.
To do so we will be primarily concerned with the steady-state impact of such
effects on output. In all cases, the exact levels of these distortions have varied
substantially over time, but given the slow convergence to steady state in any
benchmark neoclassical model (empirically or theoretically), these factors will have
a high degree of historical persistence across years and decades in any calibrated
dynamic model.
With the strong forces of inertia noted, it is worth keeping in mind the kind of
income gaps we have to explain. The income per person level in Argentina today
(about $8000) is about two-ﬁfths of that in the rich world Western Europe (about
$20,000). Thus, we are looking for a factor, or set of factors, that when imposed on a
rich country can cause income to fall by a factor of 2/5 (or drop 60%); or
equivalently, factors which when removed from a poor economy could cause
incomes to rise by a factor of 5/2 (or increase by 150%). Or, perhaps more cleanly,
in log terms we seek to explain a change in relative income of just under 1.000 log
points.

2 Argentine trade in the twentieth century
For most of the twentieth century, Argentina’s trade volumes (as a fraction of GDP)
have been very low, whether relative to their initial levels in the 1900–14 period, or
relative to the trade levels one might predict in a similar economy of comparable
size and geographic remoteness.
Figure 2 traces the evolution of the trade share over time in Argentina, measured
by exports plus imports divided by GDP. From a high of 80% or more on the eve of
World War One, this ratio fell to levels below 20% in the 1920s and 1930s and has
remained there ever since (Berlinski 2003). Even with the push towards
liberalization in the 1990s this ratio barely ticked up during that decade. This
pattern constitutes the main empirical fact about trade in Argentina in the twentieth
century.
One question is how much of this trend is explicable in terms of (potentially
changeable) trade policy frictions? And importantly, in addition, how much of those
frictions reﬂected policies in Argentina as compared to the Rest of the World? From
the 1930s to the 1960s, trade barriers were high almost everywhere in the global
´
economy. As Dıaz Alejandro and others have noted, Argentina’s policy decisions
were, therefore, not that unusual, and, as in many other countries, the shift towards

Fig. 2 Trade volumes. Source: Berlinski (2003)

political economy dynamics: when the world’s rich, core economies chose autarky
in the 1920s and especially 1930s—forces then ampliﬁed by wartime frictions—the
countries of the periphery had to seek another economic strategy in the short term,
and having been exposed to the downside risks of openness and specialization in the
primary-product ‘‘lottery,’’ they were understandably wary of again placing large
bets predicated on the assumption of a stable, globalized, liberal world order with
open markets for trade. Argentina ﬁts this pattern.
However, while Argentina’s stance was not that peculiar by the standard of
developing countries, where inward-looking development strategies were the norm,
it was unusual by the standard of the rich countries, the club to which ostensibly
Argentina wished to belong, or rather remain. After 1945, the gradual progress of
GATT (and in Europe of the EU project after 1957) carried trade integration rapidly
forward. But until the Uruguay Round (circa 1990) of negotiations, Argentina, like
most other developing countries, stood apart from this process, and policies
remained strongly protectionist.
Data on the distortionary impact of quotas are scant, but these barriers were often
very signiﬁcant in the Argentine context, whether imposed directly or by the quota
rationing of foreign exchange (as in the 1940s and early 1950s). Trade taxes are
easier to document, and Fig. 3 shows what we know about average import and
export taxes in the long run (Berlinski 2003). Import taxes were not trivial prior to
World War One as they were a key revenue source, but export taxes were zero.
Subsequently, in the 1920s and 1930s, average trade taxes began to climb. They
abated during World War 2 and the early postwar exchange control epoch. Then
import and export taxes climbed rapidly after 1960, to about a 15% level for each, or
a 30% distortion total. Judging from the timing of two asymmetrical spikes in the
1980s, export taxes tended to evaporate in hyperinﬂation episodes, while import
taxes tended to rise in an offsetting fashion, but these ﬁgures may also reﬂect
accounting problems. In the liberalization period of the 1990s, export taxes were
lifted, but import taxes remained high, although trade policy becomes somewhat
more liberal on other dimensions (e.g., quota removals for GATT/WTO compliance

What would be the likely impact of these trade barriers on income levels? We
cannot hazard a precise answer but we can use some simple impacts based on either
calibrated models or econometric estimates. In this setting, I will neglect the
standard dead-weight loss considerations since utility losses arising from static
consumption and production distortions are typically an order of magnitude too
small to be useful in discussions of the Great Divergence (usually 1–2% at most). I
narrow the focus further by examining the impact of trade frictions on two of the
most widely discussed channels through which protectionist policies might lower
incomes.
First, higher trade costs raise the costs of imported capital goods and intermediate
inputs. These costs are nontrivial, and they matter all the more in countries that are
both very open and have comparative disadvantage in these products. Argentina is a
classic example of such a country, and the understanding of this type of drag on
economic performance dates back to the classic analysis of postwar underperfor´
mance by Dıaz-Alejandro (1970), who noted that many key imported capital inputs
(e.g., farm or industrial machinery) bore domestic prices that were very high indeed
compared to world prices.
Let us now feed some numbers into a model, backed by econometric support, that
can capture this effect. Suppose, as noted above, trade costs increase by 50% due to
trade barriers (the rough magnitude of the trade tax burden since 1950). Also
suppose that imports in the initially open economy would be 40% of GDP (the
ﬁgure last seen in Argentina circa 1910, the last date when both it and the rest of the
world were close to fully open). Let us assume that intermediate inputs account for
50% of imports, and capital goods account for 25% the roughly stable ﬁgures seen
in decades of historical data in Argentina (Berlinski 2003).
Using the Estevadeordal and Taylor (2013) standard open-economy neoclassical
model, we could conclude that the trade taxes would lower GDP by roughly 0.200
log points or 20% in the long run steady state, given the import shares as above.
Two-thirds of this would arise due to higher costs of intermediates (an effect
analogous to a negative productivity shock) and one-third would arise from the

These are quantitatively large effects when the full gap to be explained is 1.000 log
points, since they explain one-ﬁfth of Argentina’s decline.
A further place to look for an impact of trade frictions on output is in the process
of technology transfer. Here there are plenty of candidate theoretical models, but no
consensus on the structure and calibration that best ﬁts the data, nor is there solid
statistical evidence for this channel. Accordingly let us rely on recent empirical
estimates and, since the effects will turn out to be small anyway, allow ourselves to
compute an upper bound for this effect. In recent work, Acharya and Keller (2008)
examine the impact of expanded imports from the ‘‘technology leader’’ country on
the TFP levels in follower countries, controlling for import levels and R&D
intensity in the leader, and interactions between the two. For their analysis, based on
mostly developed countries, and the US is the leader.
Here, we consider how the same analysis might apply to Argentina as a follower,
where the OECD might serve as the R&D source. One of the upper bound results in
Acharya and Keller (2008, Table 8) suggests that a ‘‘high’’ estimate (the 95th
percentile) for the elasticity of local TFP with respect to import volume is about
0.06 for the case of R&D intensive sectors. (For many sectors the effect is small or
negative, reﬂecting the possibility of countervailing forces where, say, import
competition is destructive of an industry that cannot catch up.)
Applying these estimates, if we apply the 0.06 elasticity to the post-1914 halving
of Argentina’s trade volumes, then this implies a reduction of TFP due to weaker
technology transfer of about only 3%. In steady state, given endogenous capital
accumulation, the impact on income would be somewhat larger and might account
for an overall income effect of 5% or just 0.050 log points. So technology transfer
via imports would appear to be a very small part of the overall story: the statistical
evidence for the channel is quite weak in aggregate, even if we make several
calibration assumptions designed to make its impact as large as we dare. To sum up,
in contrast to income losses due to inhibited technology transfer (about - 5% or
- 0.05 log points of income) the bulk of the income losses due to trade policy
frictions (about - 20% or - 0.200 log points of income) would seem to derive from
the direct effect of increased input costs for capital and intermediates.

3 Argentine investment in the twentieth century
A second area we might examine as an explanation for Argentina’s low income is
capital scarcity. By this we mean, in a standard neoclassical growth model, a
suboptimal capital/labor ratio, denoted k = K/L. In the simplest model, output per
worker y = Y/L is expressed as y = A ka, where A is productivity (total factor
productivity or TFP) and a capital share of a = 1/3 is the typical exponent used in
modern empirical work (Gollin 2002).
The steady state of the model, at a per worker capital level k* and output level y*,
can be solved by assumptions on capital accumulation, typically by either using a
Solow or Ramsey growth model. In either of these models k* and y* rise
endogenously in response to an increase in TFP, or A. Thus, in a ‘‘levels

0) can be broken down into (1) a shortfall in TFP, that is A below A0; and (2) a
friction preventing k from reaching it hypothetical optimal level k*, due to
investment taxes or other distortions that create a wedge and keep the marginal
product of capital MPK above its optimal level MPK*. Since the production
function is Cobb–Douglas, MPK = a 9 APK is proportional to APK = Y/K;
hence, these deviations can be written, following Hall and Jones (1999) as:
y=y0 ¼ ½A=A0  Á ðMPK0 =MPKÞ½a=ð1ÀaÞ ;
where, by proportionality, K/Y is replaced with a/MPK, additional human capital
terms are omitted for simplicity, and where the exponent in this equation is , given
that a = 1/3.
As regards the Great Divergence in incomes between rich and poor countries, the
consensus since Hall and Jones, has been that the A/A0 term above explains much
more of the divergence than the MPK/MPK0 term (e.g., see Easterly and Levine
2001; Gourinchas and Jeanne 2006; Caselli and Feyrer 2007, inter alia). Indeed, for
Argentina, Hall and Jones used 1988 data to compute that the MPK term above
explained about 5% of the income difference between Argentina the United States.
Does this mean that the MPK explanation is dead?
Not quite. Ideas from recent empirical research can provide us with an improved
understanding of the evolution of the Argentine capital stock. Properly computed,
MPK distortions make a signiﬁcant contribution to the income gap. For example,
Fig. 4 plots the implied MPK for the United States and Argentina using the Hall–
Jones method based on installed capital derived from a perpetual inventory method
(PIM). Their estimates stopped in 1988 since that was the last year of PWT 5.6, their
data source. But we now have PWT 6.2, with coverage until 2004, and we can see
that 1988 was quite an unusual year.
Argentina had over-borrowed and over-invested prior to the debt crisis, and then
in 1988–90 output was depressed as the economy slumped into recession and

hyperinﬂation, with installed capital suffering heavy underutilization. If one wanted
to pick a moment to make Argentina’s APK, and hence MPK look as low as
possible, that would have been the year to choose, suggesting a small MPK
distortion in total, and none at all after a price adjustment, and hence minor capital
scarcity problems. Mismeasurement is, therefore, a potentially serious issue for this
calculation.
And as we can see, for most of the last three decades the story has been very
different. Using data back to 1960 and the Hall–Jones PIM standardized
depreciation rate of 6%, the Argentine MPK level appears to be on average 50%
higher than the US level, a considerable wedge. I would argue that the deviations
from this pattern in the 1980s and in 2000–03 are easily understood and should be
discounted: these were periods of severe economic downturn when measured
installed capital is not the same as capital in use. Were it possible to further reﬁne
Argentina’s measured capital input time series every year for capacity utilization
levels—something no statistician has yet done—we would probably discover
similar gaps even in the recession periods.
Are these wedges entirely due to a factor we have already considered, the relative
price of capital? If so, we must not double count, which necessitates evaluating
MPK at local rather than world prices. The chart shows that this does make a small
difference. Evaluated at local prices the gap is clearly not so large, but it is still
signiﬁcant, and it matches up with other recent capital stock estimates using
different methodologies. For example, Coremberg (2003) pegs the Argentine and
US capital–output ratios in 1998 at 2.85 versus 1.95, respectively, translating into
APK levels of 0.351 versus 0.513, and in turn (assuming a = 1/3) MPK levels of
0.117 and 0.171.
These independent country-speciﬁc estimates very closely match the rough
estimates in Fig. 1 after applying the domestic price correction (where the 1998
MPK levels are 0.129 and 0.180). These gaps have factored in the trade distortions
considered above: these are, in other words, evidence of additional capital wedges,
beyond barriers to trade in capital goods. And they still show MPK 50% higher in
Argentina than in the United States.
These data push back a little against the ‘‘it’s A not k’’ line of argument
commonly applied to developing country underperformance. Even researchers
working in traditions traditionally sympathetic to TFP-based explanations have had
to concede that the large MPK gaps in the 1990s are clear evidence of ‘‘capital
shallowing’’ in Argentina. That is, even in the most dramatic period of economic
success in recent years, there was a pronounced failure of capital accumulation to
keep pace with the path one might expect during a productivity boom (Kydland and
Zarazaga 2002). These ﬁndings suggest that Argentina does have some difﬁculty in
mobilizing adequate capital accumulation, even when proﬁtable conditions appear.
Perhaps from the 1960s to the 1980s slow investment was the counterpart of
decelerating productivity, and Argentina could coast along with a depreciating
capital base and modest net capital stock additions, but then in the 1990s, the scope
for TFP led growth appeared and capital was apparently not adequately mobilized.
The income implications of these gaps are nontrivial. Suppose MPK in Argentina

above estimates from the 1990s, from either the PWT or Coremberg. Then in the
above expression for income differences, applying the exponent of , this capital
accumulation friction or wedge explains 25% or 0.250 log points of the overall
income difference between the two countries, and we have explained another onequarter of the Argentine puzzle.
If capital is low, and MPK is high, compared to the neoclassical benchmark, this
begs the question: why has Argentina under-invested to such an extent that the
marginal product of capital has found itself, so often, stuck far above reference
levels? What is the nature of the investment wedge? What underlying factors cause
this distortion? I cannot quantify every possible channel, but I propose several
candidate explanations which center on factors that either raise the cost of capital or
the risk of investment, and all may warrant further scrutiny.
First, there is the problem of risk due to macroeconomic rare events. As is well
known, returns to risky investments often appear excessive given what seem like
plausible models of risk aversion (Mehra and Prescott 1985). However, the
possibility of rare ‘‘crash’’ states or valuation jumps, which wipe out signiﬁcant
wealth through large capital losses, may well be sufﬁcient to resolve this puzzle
(Rietz 1988; Barro 2005). And undoubtedly, Argentine history is ﬁlled with many
examples of crashes that severely damaged many kinds of investment returns. High
or hyperinﬂation events eroded nominal debts on several occasions. These and other
major economic crises have often left the banking sector in ruins, causing credit
crunches and broader losses on a wide range of ﬁnancial instruments. If, as a result,
investment returns are more crash prone in Argentina then investors may demand a
higher return as compensation for volatility and/or skew, implying a higher
equilibrium MPK in aggregate. These risks may also be manifest in a repressed
ﬁnancial system with lower money multipliers and leverage, further tightening
credit.
Second, there is the problem of default risk and property rights. In addition to
rare events driven by market ﬂuctuations, possibly in response to macroeconomic
policies, we also have to recognize that explicit conﬁscation or redistributions of
wealth, or other failures of property rights, have often ﬁgured in Argentina’s history.
Beyond the serial pattern of default (Reinhart and Rogoff 2004), we would include
bank suspensions, forced debt conversions, speciﬁcations, and other expropriations.
Although on occasion, ex post, these events were discriminatory as to locals versus
foreigners, on most occasions, and in general ex ante, such differential treatment
may not have been expected.
If capital price distortions (e.g., trade policy) explain 0.250 log points of income
difference, and capital accumulation frictions (high MPK) explain another 0.250 log
points, we have explained one half of the 1.000 log point income difference. This is
not trivial. A 50% increase in income per person would lift Argentina from the
$8000 level to the $13,000 level (roughly on a par with Greece, Portugal, and
approaching South Korea). And even in 1913, at its relative peak, Argentina’s
income was at most 70–80% of US or UK levels, so were even half of today’s gap

Still, can we explain any more of the OECD-Argentina gap? There is a reason to
think that we can, for various reasons, given several empirically important factors
we have not yet accounted for. Three such factors could be very important.
First, there is the issue of investment quality. All calculations of MPK rely on
calculations of capital stocks based on PIM or HV methods and many standardized
assumptions. But capital ‘‘quality’’ may be generally lower in poorer countries.
Public investments are often more dilapidated in poor countries with low quality of
governance, and where large fractions of public investment spending are lost to
bribery and corruption (Tanzi and Davoodi 1997). Firm data from some countries
suggest that the same may be true of private sector investments (Bu 2006), perhaps
due to private sector corruption; or due to high costs or barriers to technical
maintenance; or due to capital complementarities with adversely maintained public
capital, leading to premature discard or under maintenance. Capital is thus less
productive and of lower capacity than its vintage alone would suggest and some
correction for higher rates of depreciation is warranted. For example, the Hall–Jones
method assumes a 6% depreciation rate on all capital. But these rates may be far too
low for uniform application to rich and poor countries. Bu (2006) estimates ‘‘low’’
median ﬁrm depreciation rates for all ﬁxed assets as 16% (Philippines) or 12%
(South Korea) in the 1990s. In Indonesia and some African countries, the reported
median depreciation rates are higher still, between 25 and 60%. This poses a
profound problem for capital stock and MPK estimates because the results are
highly sensitive to the depreciation parameter: increase this parameter by 1% and
the implied PIM measure of the capital stock falls by 1%, and implied MPK rises by
0.67% (if a = 1/3). If capital quality is lower and depreciation higher than typically
assumed, Argentina could be even more capital scarce than has been commonly
thought.
Second, there is the problem of investment misallocation. The MPK calculations
also rely on the assumption that capital is efﬁciently allocated within the economy,
or that MPK is equalized across sectors. But a contrary view with a log tradition
maintains that this is unlikely to be the case in developing countries. Instead,
investment may be misallocated for a variety of reasons—such as corruption and
inefﬁciency in the private ﬁnancial sector or the role of the state in allocating
ﬁnance. Work by Hsieh and Klenow (2009) on China and India suggests that,
compared to the US, an efﬁcient re-allocation of capital could be the equivalent of a
50% or larger increase in TFP. It is quite plausible that similar misallocation
problems, although perhaps not as grave, could affect Argentina and would go along
way to explaining any remaining income gaps, over and above what we have
measured so far. This is likely to be a productive area for future research, using
industrial census data and other measurements.
Third, and ﬁnally, there is the role of investment variety. Input price distortions
were probably the main trade-related drag on Argentina’s growth in the twentieth
century. After 1914, and particularly from the 1930s to the 1950s, this scenario
could be ascribed in some large part to highly unfavorable global conditions for
open trade; but once global trade started to boom thereafter, self-inﬂicted trade
policy distortions would remain as the principal cause of the problem. The estimate

focuses only on the so-called ‘‘intensive margin’’—the quantity of a given set of
goods imported. But recent empirical research in the trade literature suggests that
comparable economic costs may be inﬂicted by input tariffs on the ‘‘extensive
margin’’—by limiting the variety of inputs that are imported. If these results carry
over to intermediate and capital inputs, as they well might, then we would have
identiﬁed yet another trade-related barrier to investment. Quantifying that impact
for a broad range of countries, as well as for Argentina itself, remains an important
goal of future research.
These three additional factors—investment quality, allocation, and variety—
represent additional barriers to efﬁcient investment which have also probably acted
as a drag on Argentine economic performance, even if the magnitudes in question
remain open frontiers for research.

4 Concluding thoughts: deep determinants
The discussion so far of likely ‘‘microexplanations’’ suggests that we know, within
some approximate bounds, how various economic policies and institutional
deﬁciencies in the Argentine economic environment might have contributed to
economic underperformance. And indeed these contributions appear to be
empirically large, sufﬁcient to explain much of the divergence witnessed. But this
only pushes the question deeper: why have such choices been made and what can
account for them?
For all countries, not just Argentina, economists and historians have grappled
with this question in a bid to explain the deep and exogenous origins of the Great
Divergence. The problem, as I argue in this section of the paper, is that in the
particular case of Argentina the explanations that have been proposed—and which
may seem to work quite convincingly in many other countries—do not appear half
as persuasive when applied to Argentine economic history.
4.1 Geography and empire
To set the stage let us consider a now conventional casual ordering in the levels
accounting literature. As above we claim that policies causally affect outcomes,
which we might write as ‘‘policies ? income per person’’ in simple notation. A
problem that concerns some scholars is the potential for reverse causality from
incomes to policies, suggesting we look for deeper determinants that explain
policies. For example:
X ! policies ! income per person:
If X is an exogenous deep determinant, it may then be brandished as an
instrumental variable to avert endogeneity problems when regressing incomes on
either policies or institutions (e.g., see Acemogluet al. 2001; Rodrik et al. 2004).
Candidates for X are numerous in the literature. Geographic determinists have

direct effects on labor productivity (Gallup et al. 1999). Crops may affect
production organization and subsequent institutions, such as slavery, and hence the
path to democracy and capitalism (Engerman and Sokoloff 1997; Easterly and
Levine 2003). Alternatively, the impact of disease and climate may have been more
indirect, with European colonists less (more) likely to settle in the tropical
(temperate) regions, and more (less) likely to construct ‘‘extractive’’ institutions
there (Acemoglu et al. 2001).
In those accounts where historical institutional choices matter (Engerman and
Sokoloff 1997; Acemoglu et al. 2001), the key to a present-day impact is via a
political economy persistence mechanism, whereby even after independence a high
level of inequality preserves colonial extractive institutions, favoring elites, and
leading to high inequality in incomes and education, and persistently low levels of
economic development.
It now starts to become apparent why some of these theories may be poorly
equipped to explain the case of Argentina. Argentina is essentially in a temperate
zone, not a tropical zone, and that is especially true of the economic heart of the
country—the pampas and littoral regions. Those regions are also populated by a
stock of people of European descent, and they are physically and culturally separate
from the country’s colonial centers in the altiplano. Slavery existed, but was brief
and localized. Most importantly, the country did not endure persistent underdevelopment: whatever its physical and political legacy at independence, by 1900 this
was a rich country, a functioning democracy with expanding suffrage, and most
importantly an economy equipped with a decent schooling system and, for its time,
creditable levels of human capital (see the chapters by Llach and Campante and
Glaeser for more discussion on the role of education and human capital).
Argentina resembled Canada more than Cameroon in 1900. The problem to be
explained is not that the country never developed—but that it had the potential for
success, at one time it lived up to it, and then found ways to fall back into
underdevelopment. It is, by construction, very difﬁcult for geographic and historical
‘‘deep determinants’’ to explain this kind of reversal when they rely on persistence
of institutions, inequality, and economic backwardness over time. And, by way of
more direct refutation, a micro-level study of the proposed inequality-based
transmission mechanism raises further doubts: recent research has shown that
inequality was not purely a legacy of the colonial period (Arroyo Abad 2008): in
fact from 1820 to 1914, many countries saw inequality rise and fall more due to
external shocks (terms of trade, migration), and the inequality at independence thus
turned out to be a poor predictor of their inequality in 1914.
One way out of this conundrum is to keep the focus on exogenous factors, but to
look either at alternative deep determinants (e.g., law) or else at the interaction of
historical initial conditions with the powerful exogenous shocks coming from the
rest of the global economy at key moments. I end with some speculations on these

4.2 Legal origins
Inﬂuential work by Glaeser and Shleifer (2002) argues that an alternative and
plausible ‘‘deep determinant’’ of economic success is ‘‘legal origin’’—whether a
country has a common law or civil code legal system. Empirically, legal origin is
correlated with the colonizing power and, therefore, forms part of a broader
argument that among all empires the British did more good than others by
transmitting better institutions to the lands they conquered (Ferguson 2003).
Common law obtains in the Anglosphere of rich settler countries such as the US,
Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. The civil code prevails in continental
European countries and their typically much poorer former colonies. In other former
British colonies, say, the poorer regions of Africa and Asia, post-independence legal
structures reﬂect a mixed system with common law elements and some civil code
structures.
Once again, for those seeking deep determinants, Argentina offers an interesting,
unique, and somewhat perverse case that is not easily classiﬁed. It is commonly
noted that either system, common or civil, has a tendency to become somewhat
mixed over time, as jurisprudence asserts its power in civil law, and as legislatures
construct codes in common law systems. But Argentina was a very unusual case in
that it was a mixed system from the start.
The early Argentine legal system was an outcome of a long political struggle
from the period of independence (the failed Assembly of 1813 which tried to unite
the provinces and establish government) until the country was ﬁnally uniﬁed (1859).
Early efforts to write a constitution failed, not least given tension between
centralists in Buenos Aires and opposing forces elsewhere. The other provinces,
minus Buenos Aires province, promulgated the ﬁrst Constitution in 1853, under the
intellectual inﬂuence of Alberdi, with clear inspiration from the US, Swiss, and
other early constitutions. The Argentine civil code only came later, in 1869, after
´
´
uniﬁcation, and was written by Velez Sarsﬁeld.
How did these systems co-exist in practice and what economic effects did they
have? Did one or other form take the upper hand at different times? Superﬁcially, it
appears that the common law features, especially judicial review and other powers,
were often exercised in the nineteenth century. But in the twentieth century, the
pendulum has swung more toward purely civil law operation, under both democracy
and dictatorship—to such an extent that in the last decade the country has often
called on foreign experts to assist in rebuilding some of the key functions of
jurisprudence that have long lain dormant. Most legal origin evidence is crosssectional in nature, but here is an odd example of within-country time series
variation. The coincidence of economic decline and the withering of Argentina’s
constitutional and common law traditions perhaps deserves further scrutiny for
those interested in the applicability of the legal origin theory.
4.3 Potential for trade
Lastly, one important exogenous factor that is likely to have affected the path of

the potential for international trade and capital ﬂows. Prior to 1914, a growth
strategy based on openness to capital inﬂows, frontier expansion, and the strong
pursuit of comparative advantage based on primary exports carried the country to
very high levels of income per capita income.
Was this strategy viable after 1914? Given the advent of the worldwide retreat to
autarky that started then and lasts half a century, no. But what if the world economy
had remained integrated? What would Argentina’s counterfactual economic history
have looked like? Could it have maintained high living standard and growth without
being diverted onto the track of economic isolationism? No doubt the
inevitable closing of the frontier in the early twentieth century Argentina implied
a gradual structural shift from agriculture to manufacturing and services anyway (Di
Tella and Zymelman 1967). But that shift would not have quickly overwhelmed
Argentina’s natural endowment-based comparative advantage. Argentina’s structural shift was, therefore, rapidly accelerated by an autarkic economic environment—one that was at ﬁrst imposed from abroad in the 1920s and 1930s, against the
grain of domestic policy; but which was then reinforced by autarkic domestic
policies which emerged in the 1940s and 1950s, and persisted over time to the
present, long after the rest of the core economies of the world had dismantled
barriers in trade and ﬁnance.
What explains this shift? And why might it have mattered more in the case of
Argentina than in other developing countries of the time that followed the import
substitution doctrine? Taking the second question ﬁrst, I think the answer has
something to do with the fact that Argentina had more to lose, on two levels. First, it
had developed something like a modern economy, with adequately functioning
market institutions, a hope of monetary stability (after 1891), and some semblance
of democratic politics and rule of law as a foundation. Comparing Argentina to
other recently industrialized emerging economies, we can say that none had
advanced this far in 1914. Second, unlike many other such countries at the time,
Argentina had more scope to achieve gains from trade—in both goods and capital
markets. And these gains were at risk if the open trading environment broke down.
Argentina had very high trade openness and relied on foreigners for almost half of
the local capital stock and labor supply. For other countries with smaller trade
shares and smaller ﬁnancial inﬂows, the end of the ﬁrst age of globalization entailed
a fairly bothersome adjustment; for Argentina, it entailed a radical and painful
reorientation, one delayed in the 1920s and 1930s by the unfulﬁlled hope that the
pre-1914 liberal order might magically be restored.
As to the second question—why the shift?—we should perhaps consider the
important interaction between economic openness, vested interests, and internal
political economy dynamics. For example, in a different era, it has been argued that
the ‘‘shock’’ of Atlantic trade expansion empowered mercantile/capitalist interests
in the Anglo-Saxon Northwest corner of Europe, allowing this region to embrace
economic and political reforms that enhanced openness and competition in the Early
Modern period (Acemoglu et al. 2005). In Argentina, we may have seen something
of the same path dependence driven by trade shocks, only in reverse: the shock of
global trade contraction discrediting and weakening the old outward-looking order,

Argentina’s extreme comparative advantage would also play into this dynamic. Just
as gains from trade would be larger in Argentina than in other countries, given the
peculiar factor endowment, so for the same reasons the redistributive effects of
autarky would be great too (for any trade distortion, when Harberger triangles are
large, so too are the rectangles that measure redistribution of income, and thus
power—see Rogowski 1989).
These observations ﬁt with a broader theme in economic history which argues
that economic and political competition are key complements via the forces
unleashed in ‘‘open access’’ orders (North et al. 2009). Framed another way, one
might say globalization and democracy go hand in hand, and, with empirical tests
´
based on plausible instruments, this proposition holds up reasonably well (Lopez´
Cordova and Meissner 2008).
Adverse external shocks, therefore, pose a danger to political institutions and, via
path dependence, these events may have far-reaching consequences for economic
policies. The case of Argentina is perhaps an extreme example: with the most to
lose, the adverse global shocks in the mid-twentieth century were almost bound to
cause the most damage here—a sobering thought since, as I write, the world tries to
navigate its way out of another Great Depression.

Abstract The economic history of Argentina presents one of the most dramatic
examples of divergence in the modern era. What happened and why? This paper
reviews the wide range of competing explanations in the literature and argues that,
setting aside deeper social and political determinants, the various economic
mechanisms in play defy the idea of a monocausal explanation.

1 Introduction
There is an old saying among economists, possibly apocryphal, and of unclear
attribution: ‘‘throughout history there have been only four kinds of economies in the
world: advanced, developing, Japan, and Argentina’’.
This idea can be more concretely grasped by looking at evidence on the long run
levels of income per capita in a broad range of countries over the last two centuries
in Fig. 1. Material living standards have advanced across the entire world, but the

well-known Great Divergence is quite apparent. A few rich countries have become
much richer; a larger group of poorer countries have grown more slowly average.
Within each group are notable exceptions, with some very poor countries making
little progress at all. However, most striking is those countries witnessing a reversal
of fortune, moving from one group to the other.
The set of once-poor countries that are now rich include Japan, where the
transition began more than 100 years ago, and some other East Asian countries such
as Korea and Taiwan, whose transition started only 50 years ago and is now almost
complete. But going the other way there is only one notable case of a country that
started life relatively rich and ended up comparatively poor: this is the great puzzle
or paradox of Argentina. In the late nineteenth century, it was among the top ﬁve
countries in income per capita, richer than all European countries except Britain and
on a par with other rich settler societies such as the United States, Canada, and
Australia. Its status among the richest economies reached a peak around 1913 when
income convergence stopped. But even until 1929 it still clung on in this club, only
to face a slow and widening relative decline thereafter. It is now close to the average
country in the world given its level of income per capita, and its citizens enjoy only
40% of the average income per capita of the 12 core countries of Western Europe.
1.1 ‘‘MicroExplanations’’: trade and investment
In a complementary chapter by Lucas Llach in this volume, written with a different
focus, some important background is developed for the topics explored here. Llach
discusses how the prosperity of Argentina in the circa 1913–1929 period was
potentially fragile and thus vulnerable to reversal: the pre-1914 boom had been
narrowly built on the physical capital of railways and the cereal lands of the pampas
they made viable, but the potential for broader growth via industrial and human
capital was constrained. On wider human development measures, including
schooling and health, Argentina lagged its rich country rivals, and on a regional

surrounding province. Such were the peculiar initial economic conditions in
Argentina circa 1929.
To complement those ﬁndings, this chapter looks elsewhere, and in two different
directions: it looks back to some of the theories of historical ‘‘deep determinants’’
and how they might relate to Argentina’s malaise; and it steps forward to look at the
evolving story after the Great Depression with these initial conditions kept in mind.
I explore some of the main contours of the Argentina ‘‘macropuzzle’’ as the great
divergence in per capita incomes emerged and then widened after 1929, and look at
some of the quantitative explanations that have been advanced for it, in particular,
the central roles played by barriers to trade and investment.
There are many of these (and other) distortions in Argentina—perhaps too many
for the tastes of economists easily seduced by monocausal explanations tied to a toy
model with a minimum of parameters. But we are in a country with an untidy
economic history: in economic policy terms, it is a place where almost anything that
could go wrong has, at some time, actually gone wrong. In this weirdest of historical
laboratories, dozens of strange economic policy experiments have been run in the
last 200 years, often for long periods, and not infrequently with lasting
consequences. Still, in sum, a focus on some key ‘‘microexplanations’’ can help
us to understand a lot of what went wrong at the nexus of public policy and
economic performance.
1.2 ‘‘Macropuzzles’’: elusive deep determinants?
Yet beyond the search for immediate causes, of equal or greater concern to some
economists has been the search for so-called ‘‘deep determinants’’ of economic
outcomes, consisting of causally—and often temporally—distant factors that might
be placed as primal or exogenous factors which ‘‘explain’’ the proximate cause and,
hence, the ultimate outcome of economic underperformance. Among the most
widely cited explanations are a country’s geography (including land/resource
endowments as well as climate/disease environment), its colonial experience, and
the origins of its legal system.
We shall review each of these explanations as applied to the Argentine case, and
ﬁnd that, in contrast to many other countries, most of these explanations do not ﬁt
all that well. For example, Argentina is a predominantly temperate country, it has
been dominated by European settlement, it has maintained high literacy despite the
inequality, and its legal origins are a peculiar hybrid of common and civil law ideas.
Thus, in the debate over the causes of economic success and failure, Argentina
stands as an exception to many of the rules which seem to apply elsewhere,
deepening the mystery.
This contrast leaves us with the ‘‘macropuzzles’’: we have much work left to do
to piece together a plausible story not only of what went wrong, but why it went
wrong. What were the political economy mechanisms that derailed Argentina in the
twentieth century? A century ago, despite some bumps in the road, the country was
prosperous and literate, in a temperate zone, economically open, had reasonably

liberal constitutional democracy. It was not so unlike the other settler countries.
Today, a century later, it looks very different.
1.3 The explicandum
In the two main sections of the paper that follow we look at some commonly
discussed proximate factors behind Argentina’s relative economic decline. We
attempt to put these factors in some kind of empirical perspective and evaluate how
much they might have contributed to Argentina’s economic slow down.
To do so we will be primarily concerned with the steady-state impact of such
effects on output. In all cases, the exact levels of these distortions have varied
substantially over time, but given the slow convergence to steady state in any
benchmark neoclassical model (empirically or theoretically), these factors will have
a high degree of historical persistence across years and decades in any calibrated
dynamic model.
With the strong forces of inertia noted, it is worth keeping in mind the kind of
income gaps we have to explain. The income per person level in Argentina today
(about $8000) is about two-ﬁfths of that in the rich world Western Europe (about
$20,000). Thus, we are looking for a factor, or set of factors, that when imposed on a
rich country can cause income to fall by a factor of 2/5 (or drop 60%); or
equivalently, factors which when removed from a poor economy could cause
incomes to rise by a factor of 5/2 (or increase by 150%). Or, perhaps more cleanly,
in log terms we seek to explain a change in relative income of just under 1.000 log
points.

2 Argentine trade in the twentieth century
For most of the twentieth century, Argentina’s trade volumes (as a fraction of GDP)
have been very low, whether relative to their initial levels in the 1900–14 period, or
relative to the trade levels one might predict in a similar economy of comparable
size and geographic remoteness.
Figure 2 traces the evolution of the trade share over time in Argentina, measured
by exports plus imports divided by GDP. From a high of 80% or more on the eve of
World War One, this ratio fell to levels below 20% in the 1920s and 1930s and has
remained there ever since (Berlinski 2003). Even with the push towards
liberalization in the 1990s this ratio barely ticked up during that decade. This
pattern constitutes the main empirical fact about trade in Argentina in the twentieth
century.
One question is how much of this trend is explicable in terms of (potentially
changeable) trade policy frictions? And importantly, in addition, how much of those
frictions reﬂected policies in Argentina as compared to the Rest of the World? From
the 1930s to the 1960s, trade barriers were high almost everywhere in the global
´
economy. As Dıaz Alejandro and others have noted, Argentina’s policy decisions
were, therefore, not that unusual, and, as in many other countries, the shift towards

political economy dynamics: when the world’s rich, core economies chose autarky
in the 1920s and especially 1930s—forces then ampliﬁed by wartime frictions—the
countries of the periphery had to seek another economic strategy in the short term,
and having been exposed to the downside risks of openness and specialization in the
primary-product ‘‘lottery,’’ they were understandably wary of again placing large
bets predicated on the assumption of a stable, globalized, liberal world order with
open markets for trade. Argentina ﬁts this pattern.
However, while Argentina’s stance was not that peculiar by the standard of
developing countries, where inward-looking development strategies were the norm,
it was unusual by the standard of the rich countries, the club to which ostensibly
Argentina wished to belong, or rather remain. After 1945, the gradual progress of
GATT (and in Europe of the EU project after 1957) carried trade integration rapidly
forward. But until the Uruguay Round (circa 1990) of negotiations, Argentina, like
most other developing countries, stood apart from this process, and policies
remained strongly protectionist.
Data on the distortionary impact of quotas are scant, but these barriers were often
very signiﬁcant in the Argentine context, whether imposed directly or by the quota
rationing of foreign exchange (as in the 1940s and early 1950s). Trade taxes are
easier to document, and Fig. 3 shows what we know about average import and
export taxes in the long run (Berlinski 2003). Import taxes were not trivial prior to
World War One as they were a key revenue source, but export taxes were zero.
Subsequently, in the 1920s and 1930s, average trade taxes began to climb. They
abated during World War 2 and the early postwar exchange control epoch. Then
import and export taxes climbed rapidly after 1960, to about a 15% level for each, or
a 30% distortion total. Judging from the timing of two asymmetrical spikes in the
1980s, export taxes tended to evaporate in hyperinﬂation episodes, while import
taxes tended to rise in an offsetting fashion, but these ﬁgures may also reﬂect
accounting problems. In the liberalization period of the 1990s, export taxes were
lifted, but import taxes remained high, although trade policy becomes somewhat
more liberal on other dimensions (e.g., quota removals for GATT/WTO compliance

Fig. 3 Trade taxes. Source: Berlinski (2003)

What would be the likely impact of these trade barriers on income levels? We
cannot hazard a precise answer but we can use some simple impacts based on either
calibrated models or econometric estimates. In this setting, I will neglect the
standard dead-weight loss considerations since utility losses arising from static
consumption and production distortions are typically an order of magnitude too
small to be useful in discussions of the Great Divergence (usually 1–2% at most). I
narrow the focus further by examining the impact of trade frictions on two of the
most widely discussed channels through which protectionist policies might lower
incomes.
First, higher trade costs raise the costs of imported capital goods and intermediate
inputs. These costs are nontrivial, and they matter all the more in countries that are
both very open and have comparative disadvantage in these products. Argentina is a
classic example of such a country, and the understanding of this type of drag on
economic performance dates back to the classic analysis of postwar underperfor´
mance by Dıaz-Alejandro (1970), who noted that many key imported capital inputs
(e.g., farm or industrial machinery) bore domestic prices that were very high indeed
compared to world prices.
Let us now feed some numbers into a model, backed by econometric support, that
can capture this effect. Suppose, as noted above, trade costs increase by 50% due to
trade barriers (the rough magnitude of the trade tax burden since 1950). Also
suppose that imports in the initially open economy would be 40% of GDP (the
ﬁgure last seen in Argentina circa 1910, the last date when both it and the rest of the
world were close to fully open). Let us assume that intermediate inputs account for
50% of imports, and capital goods account for 25% the roughly stable ﬁgures seen
in decades of historical data in Argentina (Berlinski 2003).
Using the Estevadeordal and Taylor (2013) standard open-economy neoclassical
model, we could conclude that the trade taxes would lower GDP by roughly 0.200
log points or 20% in the long run steady state, given the import shares as above.
Two-thirds of this would arise due to higher costs of intermediates (an effect
analogous to a negative productivity shock) and one-third would arise from the

These are quantitatively large effects when the full gap to be explained is 1.000 log
points, since they explain one-ﬁfth of Argentina’s decline.
A further place to look for an impact of trade frictions on output is in the process
of technology transfer. Here there are plenty of candidate theoretical models, but no
consensus on the structure and calibration that best ﬁts the data, nor is there solid
statistical evidence for this channel. Accordingly let us rely on recent empirical
estimates and, since the effects will turn out to be small anyway, allow ourselves to
compute an upper bound for this effect. In recent work, Acharya and Keller (2008)
examine the impact of expanded imports from the ‘‘technology leader’’ country on
the TFP levels in follower countries, controlling for import levels and R&D
intensity in the leader, and interactions between the two. For their analysis, based on
mostly developed countries, and the US is the leader.
Here, we consider how the same analysis might apply to Argentina as a follower,
where the OECD might serve as the R&D source. One of the upper bound results in
Acharya and Keller (2008, Table 8) suggests that a ‘‘high’’ estimate (the 95th
percentile) for the elasticity of local TFP with respect to import volume is about
0.06 for the case of R&D intensive sectors. (For many sectors the effect is small or
negative, reﬂecting the possibility of countervailing forces where, say, import
competition is destructive of an industry that cannot catch up.)
Applying these estimates, if we apply the 0.06 elasticity to the post-1914 halving
of Argentina’s trade volumes, then this implies a reduction of TFP due to weaker
technology transfer of about only 3%. In steady state, given endogenous capital
accumulation, the impact on income would be somewhat larger and might account
for an overall income effect of 5% or just 0.050 log points. So technology transfer
via imports would appear to be a very small part of the overall story: the statistical
evidence for the channel is quite weak in aggregate, even if we make several
calibration assumptions designed to make its impact as large as we dare. To sum up,
in contrast to income losses due to inhibited technology transfer (about - 5% or
- 0.05 log points of income) the bulk of the income losses due to trade policy
frictions (about - 20% or - 0.200 log points of income) would seem to derive from
the direct effect of increased input costs for capital and intermediates.

3 Argentine investment in the twentieth century
A second area we might examine as an explanation for Argentina’s low income is
capital scarcity. By this we mean, in a standard neoclassical growth model, a
suboptimal capital/labor ratio, denoted k = K/L. In the simplest model, output per
worker y = Y/L is expressed as y = A ka, where A is productivity (total factor
productivity or TFP) and a capital share of a = 1/3 is the typical exponent used in
modern empirical work (Gollin 2002).
The steady state of the model, at a per worker capital level k* and output level y*,
can be solved by assumptions on capital accumulation, typically by either using a
Solow or Ramsey growth model. In either of these models k* and y* rise
endogenously in response to an increase in TFP, or A. Thus, in a ‘‘levels

0) can be broken down into (1) a shortfall in TFP, that is A below A0; and (2) a
friction preventing k from reaching it hypothetical optimal level k*, due to
investment taxes or other distortions that create a wedge and keep the marginal
product of capital MPK above its optimal level MPK*. Since the production
function is Cobb–Douglas, MPK = a 9 APK is proportional to APK = Y/K;
hence, these deviations can be written, following Hall and Jones (1999) as:
y=y0 ¼ ½A=A0  Á ðMPK0 =MPKÞ½a=ð1ÀaÞ ;
where, by proportionality, K/Y is replaced with a/MPK, additional human capital
terms are omitted for simplicity, and where the exponent in this equation is , given
that a = 1/3.
As regards the Great Divergence in incomes between rich and poor countries, the
consensus since Hall and Jones, has been that the A/A0 term above explains much
more of the divergence than the MPK/MPK0 term (e.g., see Easterly and Levine
2001; Gourinchas and Jeanne 2006; Caselli and Feyrer 2007, inter alia). Indeed, for
Argentina, Hall and Jones used 1988 data to compute that the MPK term above
explained about 5% of the income difference between Argentina the United States.
Does this mean that the MPK explanation is dead?
Not quite. Ideas from recent empirical research can provide us with an improved
understanding of the evolution of the Argentine capital stock. Properly computed,
MPK distortions make a signiﬁcant contribution to the income gap. For example,
Fig. 4 plots the implied MPK for the United States and Argentina using the Hall–
Jones method based on installed capital derived from a perpetual inventory method
(PIM). Their estimates stopped in 1988 since that was the last year of PWT 5.6, their
data source. But we now have PWT 6.2, with coverage until 2004, and we can see
that 1988 was quite an unusual year.
Argentina had over-borrowed and over-invested prior to the debt crisis, and then
in 1988–90 output was depressed as the economy slumped into recession and

hyperinﬂation, with installed capital suffering heavy underutilization. If one wanted
to pick a moment to make Argentina’s APK, and hence MPK look as low as
possible, that would have been the year to choose, suggesting a small MPK
distortion in total, and none at all after a price adjustment, and hence minor capital
scarcity problems. Mismeasurement is, therefore, a potentially serious issue for this
calculation.
And as we can see, for most of the last three decades the story has been very
different. Using data back to 1960 and the Hall–Jones PIM standardized
depreciation rate of 6%, the Argentine MPK level appears to be on average 50%
higher than the US level, a considerable wedge. I would argue that the deviations
from this pattern in the 1980s and in 2000–03 are easily understood and should be
discounted: these were periods of severe economic downturn when measured
installed capital is not the same as capital in use. Were it possible to further reﬁne
Argentina’s measured capital input time series every year for capacity utilization
levels—something no statistician has yet done—we would probably discover
similar gaps even in the recession periods.
Are these wedges entirely due to a factor we have already considered, the relative
price of capital? If so, we must not double count, which necessitates evaluating
MPK at local rather than world prices. The chart shows that this does make a small
difference. Evaluated at local prices the gap is clearly not so large, but it is still
signiﬁcant, and it matches up with other recent capital stock estimates using
different methodologies. For example, Coremberg (2003) pegs the Argentine and
US capital–output ratios in 1998 at 2.85 versus 1.95, respectively, translating into
APK levels of 0.351 versus 0.513, and in turn (assuming a = 1/3) MPK levels of
0.117 and 0.171.
These independent country-speciﬁc estimates very closely match the rough
estimates in Fig. 1 after applying the domestic price correction (where the 1998
MPK levels are 0.129 and 0.180). These gaps have factored in the trade distortions
considered above: these are, in other words, evidence of additional capital wedges,
beyond barriers to trade in capital goods. And they still show MPK 50% higher in
Argentina than in the United States.
These data push back a little against the ‘‘it’s A not k’’ line of argument
commonly applied to developing country underperformance. Even researchers
working in traditions traditionally sympathetic to TFP-based explanations have had
to concede that the large MPK gaps in the 1990s are clear evidence of ‘‘capital
shallowing’’ in Argentina. That is, even in the most dramatic period of economic
success in recent years, there was a pronounced failure of capital accumulation to
keep pace with the path one might expect during a productivity boom (Kydland and
Zarazaga 2002). These ﬁndings suggest that Argentina does have some difﬁculty in
mobilizing adequate capital accumulation, even when proﬁtable conditions appear.
Perhaps from the 1960s to the 1980s slow investment was the counterpart of
decelerating productivity, and Argentina could coast along with a depreciating
capital base and modest net capital stock additions, but then in the 1990s, the scope
for TFP led growth appeared and capital was apparently not adequately mobilized.
The income implications of these gaps are nontrivial. Suppose MPK in Argentina

above estimates from the 1990s, from either the PWT or Coremberg. Then in the
above expression for income differences, applying the exponent of , this capital
accumulation friction or wedge explains 25% or 0.250 log points of the overall
income difference between the two countries, and we have explained another onequarter of the Argentine puzzle.
If capital is low, and MPK is high, compared to the neoclassical benchmark, this
begs the question: why has Argentina under-invested to such an extent that the
marginal product of capital has found itself, so often, stuck far above reference
levels? What is the nature of the investment wedge? What underlying factors cause
this distortion? I cannot quantify every possible channel, but I propose several
candidate explanations which center on factors that either raise the cost of capital or
the risk of investment, and all may warrant further scrutiny.
First, there is the problem of risk due to macroeconomic rare events. As is well
known, returns to risky investments often appear excessive given what seem like
plausible models of risk aversion (Mehra and Prescott 1985). However, the
possibility of rare ‘‘crash’’ states or valuation jumps, which wipe out signiﬁcant
wealth through large capital losses, may well be sufﬁcient to resolve this puzzle
(Rietz 1988; Barro 2005). And undoubtedly, Argentine history is ﬁlled with many
examples of crashes that severely damaged many kinds of investment returns. High
or hyperinﬂation events eroded nominal debts on several occasions. These and other
major economic crises have often left the banking sector in ruins, causing credit
crunches and broader losses on a wide range of ﬁnancial instruments. If, as a result,
investment returns are more crash prone in Argentina then investors may demand a
higher return as compensation for volatility and/or skew, implying a higher
equilibrium MPK in aggregate. These risks may also be manifest in a repressed
ﬁnancial system with lower money multipliers and leverage, further tightening
credit.
Second, there is the problem of default risk and property rights. In addition to
rare events driven by market ﬂuctuations, possibly in response to macroeconomic
policies, we also have to recognize that explicit conﬁscation or redistributions of
wealth, or other failures of property rights, have often ﬁgured in Argentina’s history.
Beyond the serial pattern of default (Reinhart and Rogoff 2004), we would include
bank suspensions, forced debt conversions, speciﬁcations, and other expropriations.
Although on occasion, ex post, these events were discriminatory as to locals versus
foreigners, on most occasions, and in general ex ante, such differential treatment
may not have been expected.
If capital price distortions (e.g., trade policy) explain 0.250 log points of income
difference, and capital accumulation frictions (high MPK) explain another 0.250 log
points, we have explained one half of the 1.000 log point income difference. This is
not trivial. A 50% increase in income per person would lift Argentina from the
$8000 level to the $13,000 level (roughly on a par with Greece, Portugal, and
approaching South Korea). And even in 1913, at its relative peak, Argentina’s
income was at most 70–80% of US or UK levels, so were even half of today’s gap

Still, can we explain any more of the OECD-Argentina gap? There is a reason to
think that we can, for various reasons, given several empirically important factors
we have not yet accounted for. Three such factors could be very important.
First, there is the issue of investment quality. All calculations of MPK rely on
calculations of capital stocks based on PIM or HV methods and many standardized
assumptions. But capital ‘‘quality’’ may be generally lower in poorer countries.
Public investments are often more dilapidated in poor countries with low quality of
governance, and where large fractions of public investment spending are lost to
bribery and corruption (Tanzi and Davoodi 1997). Firm data from some countries
suggest that the same may be true of private sector investments (Bu 2006), perhaps
due to private sector corruption; or due to high costs or barriers to technical
maintenance; or due to capital complementarities with adversely maintained public
capital, leading to premature discard or under maintenance. Capital is thus less
productive and of lower capacity than its vintage alone would suggest and some
correction for higher rates of depreciation is warranted. For example, the Hall–Jones
method assumes a 6% depreciation rate on all capital. But these rates may be far too
low for uniform application to rich and poor countries. Bu (2006) estimates ‘‘low’’
median ﬁrm depreciation rates for all ﬁxed assets as 16% (Philippines) or 12%
(South Korea) in the 1990s. In Indonesia and some African countries, the reported
median depreciation rates are higher still, between 25 and 60%. This poses a
profound problem for capital stock and MPK estimates because the results are
highly sensitive to the depreciation parameter: increase this parameter by 1% and
the implied PIM measure of the capital stock falls by 1%, and implied MPK rises by
0.67% (if a = 1/3). If capital quality is lower and depreciation higher than typically
assumed, Argentina could be even more capital scarce than has been commonly
thought.
Second, there is the problem of investment misallocation. The MPK calculations
also rely on the assumption that capital is efﬁciently allocated within the economy,
or that MPK is equalized across sectors. But a contrary view with a log tradition
maintains that this is unlikely to be the case in developing countries. Instead,
investment may be misallocated for a variety of reasons—such as corruption and
inefﬁciency in the private ﬁnancial sector or the role of the state in allocating
ﬁnance. Work by Hsieh and Klenow (2009) on China and India suggests that,
compared to the US, an efﬁcient re-allocation of capital could be the equivalent of a
50% or larger increase in TFP. It is quite plausible that similar misallocation
problems, although perhaps not as grave, could affect Argentina and would go along
way to explaining any remaining income gaps, over and above what we have
measured so far. This is likely to be a productive area for future research, using
industrial census data and other measurements.
Third, and ﬁnally, there is the role of investment variety. Input price distortions
were probably the main trade-related drag on Argentina’s growth in the twentieth
century. After 1914, and particularly from the 1930s to the 1950s, this scenario
could be ascribed in some large part to highly unfavorable global conditions for
open trade; but once global trade started to boom thereafter, self-inﬂicted trade
policy distortions would remain as the principal cause of the problem. The estimate

focuses only on the so-called ‘‘intensive margin’’—the quantity of a given set of
goods imported. But recent empirical research in the trade literature suggests that
comparable economic costs may be inﬂicted by input tariffs on the ‘‘extensive
margin’’—by limiting the variety of inputs that are imported. If these results carry
over to intermediate and capital inputs, as they well might, then we would have
identiﬁed yet another trade-related barrier to investment. Quantifying that impact
for a broad range of countries, as well as for Argentina itself, remains an important
goal of future research.
These three additional factors—investment quality, allocation, and variety—
represent additional barriers to efﬁcient investment which have also probably acted
as a drag on Argentine economic performance, even if the magnitudes in question
remain open frontiers for research.

4 Concluding thoughts: deep determinants
The discussion so far of likely ‘‘microexplanations’’ suggests that we know, within
some approximate bounds, how various economic policies and institutional
deﬁciencies in the Argentine economic environment might have contributed to
economic underperformance. And indeed these contributions appear to be
empirically large, sufﬁcient to explain much of the divergence witnessed. But this
only pushes the question deeper: why have such choices been made and what can
account for them?
For all countries, not just Argentina, economists and historians have grappled
with this question in a bid to explain the deep and exogenous origins of the Great
Divergence. The problem, as I argue in this section of the paper, is that in the
particular case of Argentina the explanations that have been proposed—and which
may seem to work quite convincingly in many other countries—do not appear half
as persuasive when applied to Argentine economic history.
4.1 Geography and empire
To set the stage let us consider a now conventional casual ordering in the levels
accounting literature. As above we claim that policies causally affect outcomes,
which we might write as ‘‘policies ? income per person’’ in simple notation. A
problem that concerns some scholars is the potential for reverse causality from
incomes to policies, suggesting we look for deeper determinants that explain
policies. For example:
X ! policies ! income per person:
If X is an exogenous deep determinant, it may then be brandished as an
instrumental variable to avert endogeneity problems when regressing incomes on
either policies or institutions (e.g., see Acemogluet al. 2001; Rodrik et al. 2004).
Candidates for X are numerous in the literature. Geographic determinists have

direct effects on labor productivity (Gallup et al. 1999). Crops may affect
production organization and subsequent institutions, such as slavery, and hence the
path to democracy and capitalism (Engerman and Sokoloff 1997; Easterly and
Levine 2003). Alternatively, the impact of disease and climate may have been more
indirect, with European colonists less (more) likely to settle in the tropical
(temperate) regions, and more (less) likely to construct ‘‘extractive’’ institutions
there (Acemoglu et al. 2001).
In those accounts where historical institutional choices matter (Engerman and
Sokoloff 1997; Acemoglu et al. 2001), the key to a present-day impact is via a
political economy persistence mechanism, whereby even after independence a high
level of inequality preserves colonial extractive institutions, favoring elites, and
leading to high inequality in incomes and education, and persistently low levels of
economic development.
It now starts to become apparent why some of these theories may be poorly
equipped to explain the case of Argentina. Argentina is essentially in a temperate
zone, not a tropical zone, and that is especially true of the economic heart of the
country—the pampas and littoral regions. Those regions are also populated by a
stock of people of European descent, and they are physically and culturally separate
from the country’s colonial centers in the altiplano. Slavery existed, but was brief
and localized. Most importantly, the country did not endure persistent underdevelopment: whatever its physical and political legacy at independence, by 1900 this
was a rich country, a functioning democracy with expanding suffrage, and most
importantly an economy equipped with a decent schooling system and, for its time,
creditable levels of human capital (see the chapters by Llach and Campante and
Glaeser for more discussion on the role of education and human capital).
Argentina resembled Canada more than Cameroon in 1900. The problem to be
explained is not that the country never developed—but that it had the potential for
success, at one time it lived up to it, and then found ways to fall back into
underdevelopment. It is, by construction, very difﬁcult for geographic and historical
‘‘deep determinants’’ to explain this kind of reversal when they rely on persistence
of institutions, inequality, and economic backwardness over time. And, by way of
more direct refutation, a micro-level study of the proposed inequality-based
transmission mechanism raises further doubts: recent research has shown that
inequality was not purely a legacy of the colonial period (Arroyo Abad 2008): in
fact from 1820 to 1914, many countries saw inequality rise and fall more due to
external shocks (terms of trade, migration), and the inequality at independence thus
turned out to be a poor predictor of their inequality in 1914.
One way out of this conundrum is to keep the focus on exogenous factors, but to
look either at alternative deep determinants (e.g., law) or else at the interaction of
historical initial conditions with the powerful exogenous shocks coming from the
rest of the global economy at key moments. I end with some speculations on these

4.2 Legal origins
Inﬂuential work by Glaeser and Shleifer (2002) argues that an alternative and
plausible ‘‘deep determinant’’ of economic success is ‘‘legal origin’’—whether a
country has a common law or civil code legal system. Empirically, legal origin is
correlated with the colonizing power and, therefore, forms part of a broader
argument that among all empires the British did more good than others by
transmitting better institutions to the lands they conquered (Ferguson 2003).
Common law obtains in the Anglosphere of rich settler countries such as the US,
Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. The civil code prevails in continental
European countries and their typically much poorer former colonies. In other former
British colonies, say, the poorer regions of Africa and Asia, post-independence legal
structures reﬂect a mixed system with common law elements and some civil code
structures.
Once again, for those seeking deep determinants, Argentina offers an interesting,
unique, and somewhat perverse case that is not easily classiﬁed. It is commonly
noted that either system, common or civil, has a tendency to become somewhat
mixed over time, as jurisprudence asserts its power in civil law, and as legislatures
construct codes in common law systems. But Argentina was a very unusual case in
that it was a mixed system from the start.
The early Argentine legal system was an outcome of a long political struggle
from the period of independence (the failed Assembly of 1813 which tried to unite
the provinces and establish government) until the country was ﬁnally uniﬁed (1859).
Early efforts to write a constitution failed, not least given tension between
centralists in Buenos Aires and opposing forces elsewhere. The other provinces,
minus Buenos Aires province, promulgated the ﬁrst Constitution in 1853, under the
intellectual inﬂuence of Alberdi, with clear inspiration from the US, Swiss, and
other early constitutions. The Argentine civil code only came later, in 1869, after
´
´
uniﬁcation, and was written by Velez Sarsﬁeld.
How did these systems co-exist in practice and what economic effects did they
have? Did one or other form take the upper hand at different times? Superﬁcially, it
appears that the common law features, especially judicial review and other powers,
were often exercised in the nineteenth century. But in the twentieth century, the
pendulum has swung more toward purely civil law operation, under both democracy
and dictatorship—to such an extent that in the last decade the country has often
called on foreign experts to assist in rebuilding some of the key functions of
jurisprudence that have long lain dormant. Most legal origin evidence is crosssectional in nature, but here is an odd example of within-country time series
variation. The coincidence of economic decline and the withering of Argentina’s
constitutional and common law traditions perhaps deserves further scrutiny for
those interested in the applicability of the legal origin theory.
4.3 Potential for trade
Lastly, one important exogenous factor that is likely to have affected the path of

the potential for international trade and capital ﬂows. Prior to 1914, a growth
strategy based on openness to capital inﬂows, frontier expansion, and the strong
pursuit of comparative advantage based on primary exports carried the country to
very high levels of income per capita income.
Was this strategy viable after 1914? Given the advent of the worldwide retreat to
autarky that started then and lasts half a century, no. But what if the world economy
had remained integrated? What would Argentina’s counterfactual economic history
have looked like? Could it have maintained high living standard and growth without
being diverted onto the track of economic isolationism? No doubt the
inevitable closing of the frontier in the early twentieth century Argentina implied
a gradual structural shift from agriculture to manufacturing and services anyway (Di
Tella and Zymelman 1967). But that shift would not have quickly overwhelmed
Argentina’s natural endowment-based comparative advantage. Argentina’s structural shift was, therefore, rapidly accelerated by an autarkic economic environment—one that was at ﬁrst imposed from abroad in the 1920s and 1930s, against the
grain of domestic policy; but which was then reinforced by autarkic domestic
policies which emerged in the 1940s and 1950s, and persisted over time to the
present, long after the rest of the core economies of the world had dismantled
barriers in trade and ﬁnance.
What explains this shift? And why might it have mattered more in the case of
Argentina than in other developing countries of the time that followed the import
substitution doctrine? Taking the second question ﬁrst, I think the answer has
something to do with the fact that Argentina had more to lose, on two levels. First, it
had developed something like a modern economy, with adequately functioning
market institutions, a hope of monetary stability (after 1891), and some semblance
of democratic politics and rule of law as a foundation. Comparing Argentina to
other recently industrialized emerging economies, we can say that none had
advanced this far in 1914. Second, unlike many other such countries at the time,
Argentina had more scope to achieve gains from trade—in both goods and capital
markets. And these gains were at risk if the open trading environment broke down.
Argentina had very high trade openness and relied on foreigners for almost half of
the local capital stock and labor supply. For other countries with smaller trade
shares and smaller ﬁnancial inﬂows, the end of the ﬁrst age of globalization entailed
a fairly bothersome adjustment; for Argentina, it entailed a radical and painful
reorientation, one delayed in the 1920s and 1930s by the unfulﬁlled hope that the
pre-1914 liberal order might magically be restored.
As to the second question—why the shift?—we should perhaps consider the
important interaction between economic openness, vested interests, and internal
political economy dynamics. For example, in a different era, it has been argued that
the ‘‘shock’’ of Atlantic trade expansion empowered mercantile/capitalist interests
in the Anglo-Saxon Northwest corner of Europe, allowing this region to embrace
economic and political reforms that enhanced openness and competition in the Early
Modern period (Acemoglu et al. 2005). In Argentina, we may have seen something
of the same path dependence driven by trade shocks, only in reverse: the shock of
global trade contraction discrediting and weakening the old outward-looking order,

Argentina’s extreme comparative advantage would also play into this dynamic. Just
as gains from trade would be larger in Argentina than in other countries, given the
peculiar factor endowment, so for the same reasons the redistributive effects of
autarky would be great too (for any trade distortion, when Harberger triangles are
large, so too are the rectangles that measure redistribution of income, and thus
power—see Rogowski 1989).
These observations ﬁt with a broader theme in economic history which argues
that economic and political competition are key complements via the forces
unleashed in ‘‘open access’’ orders (North et al. 2009). Framed another way, one
might say globalization and democracy go hand in hand, and, with empirical tests
´
based on plausible instruments, this proposition holds up reasonably well (Lopez´
Cordova and Meissner 2008).
Adverse external shocks, therefore, pose a danger to political institutions and, via
path dependence, these events may have far-reaching consequences for economic
policies. The case of Argentina is perhaps an extreme example: with the most to
lose, the adverse global shocks in the mid-twentieth century were almost bound to
cause the most damage here—a sobering thought since, as I write, the world tries to
navigate its way out of another Great Depression.
