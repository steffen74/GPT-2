The present paper analyses the extent of intergenerational transmission of
educational achievements in 18 Latin American economies. While there is a large
literature on the intergenerational transmission of income and status for developed
economies, the evidence on the extent of intergenerational mobility for emerging
countries is more restricted (due to data limitations).1 In particular, one of the main
problems for the analysis of intergenerational mobility for the Latin American
region is the unavailability of panel data (selected countries, e.g. Chile and Mexico,
have recently started to follow individuals over time) that would enable connecting
the income or wealth for parents with the income of their offspring.2
However, using representative population samples at the country level for a large
number of Latin American countries, this paper can link the educational attainment
of parents with that of their children, measuring intergenerational persistence of
educational attainment. Moreover, we deepen the analysis by considering different
cohorts, as well as the inﬂuence of circumstances (e.g. race, gender, parental income
background). As education is an important driver of labour market income and
measurement errors of parental educational outcomes are much smaller than
income-related variables, this approach, which has also been followed in the
literature for developing countries, can be implemented for a larger number of
countries.
This paper uses three measures of intergenerational educational mobility: the
beta-coefﬁcient, the partial correlation coefﬁcient, and the overall effect of
circumstances beyond an individual’s control (i.e. the index of inequality of
opportunity). All measures coincide in pointing out the relatively low degree of
intergenerational mobility in Latin America and the importance of parental
background in determining educational success.
Within Latin America, there are important differences: while the persistence of
educational attainment is relatively low in Costa Rica, Uruguay, Guatemala and
Argentina (the beta-coefﬁcient of educational attainment is below 50 %), in
Dominican Republic, Venezuela and El Salvador it is above 70 %. The case of
Chile is remarkable, as the beta-coefﬁcient shows that the intergenerational
persistence in educational achievement is 57 %—lower than the average value of
60 %—but the partial correlation coefﬁcient is 67 % and the overall index of
inequality of opportunity is 48 %, the highest value among the sample.
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section ‘‘Literature review’’

Azevedo and Bouillon (2010) review the evidence on intergenerational social mobility by summarising
a set of papers for Latin America, and ﬁnd that intergenerational social mobility is lower than the levels
observed in the United States or the United Kingdom. The authors also note the unavailability of panel
data for the region. Cuesta et al. (2011) use pseudo panels to overcome this problem for a sample of 14
in the empirical assessment. Section ‘‘Empirical results’’ presents the main results
for Latin America and Sect. ‘‘Conclusions and some policy implications’’ discusses
potential implications.

2 Literature review
Income inequality in Latin America is extremely high compared to other emerging
economies as well as high-income countries (e.g. see Hertz et al. 20073; OECD,
2008; Azevedo and Bouillon 2010; Ferreira and Gignoux 2011, 2013; Brunori et al.
2013; Torche 2014). In principle, this type of static income inequality across
individuals (at a certain point in time) does not have to be bad per se, as the
dispersion in earnings could act as a strong incentive for parents to invest in their
children’s education. However, for poor households to be able to grasp these
opportunities, they should have access to well-functioning credit markets, as the
presence of credit constraints reinforces the intergenerational transmission of
income (Aiyagari et al. 2003).4
In principle, educational attainment is a key determinant of wage earnings.
Therefore, differences in acquired education are important to understand static
income inequality.
Hertz et al. (2007) estimate 50-year trends in intergenerational persistence of
educational attainment for 42 countries, ﬁnding the largest intergenerational
correlations in the seven Latin American countries included in their analysis. The
authors ﬁnd that while the beta-coefﬁcient decreased over the last 50 years
(suggesting an increase in intergenerational mobility), no trend is observed for the
partial correlation coefﬁcient. The authors suggest that while both are linear
measures of statistical association and not the true causal effect, the beta-coefﬁcient
might overestimate the true structural parameter of intergenerational mobility due to
the omission of other explanatory variables.
Building on the terminology proposed by Roemer (1998), which distinguishes
between ‘‘efforts’’ (factors that individuals can control) and ‘‘circumstances’’
(factors beyond one’s control, such as race, birthplace, or family background) in
determining ‘‘advantages’’ (outcomes as a result of the combination of circumstances and effort), Ferreira and Gignoux (2011) propose a scalar measure of
inequality of opportunity. They conduct a comparative analysis of six Latin
American countries and ﬁnd that in three of them, inequality of opportunity is linked
to racial origin (indigenous or Afro-descendants).5 In a later study, Brunori et al.
(2013) analyse inequality of opportunity in a comparative form for 41 countries, of

Hertz et al. (2007) study the intergenerational transmission of educational outcomes in 50 developed
and developing countries using household surveys. They present results for seven countries from Latin
America: Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Peru, and Nicaragua.

In Latin America, as documented by Tejerina and Westley (2007) using household surveys, the poor
have reduced access to credit and saving instruments.

5

Data for this paper come from nationally representative household surveys dated 1996 for Brazil, 2003
positively correlated with income inequality, and negatively related to intergenerational income and educational mobility. Moreover, they ﬁnd the highest levels of
inequality of opportunity for these six Latin American countries among the whole
sample considered.7
Corak (2013) also links the presence of inequality with lack of opportunities and
of mobility. He argues that the presence of inequality shapes opportunities and in
turn, lack of opportunity lowers mobility.8 By describing the case of the United
States, Corak (2013) argues that the ‘‘American Dream’’ (i.e. prospects for upward
mobility) makes low income earners not strong advocates of redistributive policies,
because of the belief that either they or their descendants can climb the income
ladder.9 Corak (2013) cites Solon (2004) arguing that the Great Gatsby Curve (the
relationship between more income inequality and less intergenerational mobility)
can be due to high returns to education.10 Parents with high education would have
both the capacity and the incentive to invest in their children’s education.
Recently, Torche (2014) discusses the literature on equality of opportunity in a
set of studies for Latin America. The review ﬁnds that parental education is the most
inﬂuential circumstance for an individual, concluding that inequality of opportunity
is higher in Latin America than in industrial countries. Torche argues that the high
(albeit decreasing) returns to education in Latin America can foster mobility, but
they might also create a situation of ‘‘inherited meritocracy’’, because of the barriers
that the lower segments of the income distribution face in accessing education
(quantity and quality). Relatedly, Azevedo and Bouillon (2010) associate the high
levels of immobility in Latin America with social exclusion, low access to higher
education and labour market discrimination.11
If societies do not bring equal opportunities based on merit and ability,
independent of race, gender or social origin, then today’s social and economic status
may be transmitted from parents to their offspring. The focus of this paper is
precisely the analysis of mobility in terms of educational attainment for parents and
children. In particular, a contribution of the paper is enriching the analysis by
considering several dimensions: race, gender and parental income, and analysing the
robustness of the ﬁndings across different measures of intergenerational mobility.

Citing Roemer (1998) and Corak (2013) argues that circumstances affect opportunity by three channels:
social capital, genetic traits, and family values, and that while policies that affect social capital tend to be
accepted, less consensus is placed on policies intending to offset genetic advantages, and within-family
investments.

9

Corak (2013) concludes that relatively less upward mobility of the least advantaged is one of the
reasons why intergenerational mobility in the United States is lower than in other countries. In addition,
Corak (2013) concludes that the persistence at the top 1 % of the income distribution also makes
intergenerational mobility in the United States lower than in other countries.

countries in the region. With the exception of Cuesta et al. (2011), the available
studies generally have covered these issues for a maximum of seven countries, often
with larger samples that allow studying speciﬁc countries in depth. The present
paper’s broader country coverage complements this literature by emphasising both
the common features within the region, as well as the differences across countries.
In contrast to Cuesta et al. (2011), who rely on pseudo cohorts to study
intergenerational income mobility, we use the directly reported own and parental
education level, which allows us to rely on a larger number of observations (in our
sample, we have around 14,000 observations compared to around 1000). This also
allows us to have relatively precise estimates for individual countries and explore
what drives the differences across countries. Furthermore, while income mobility in
principle encompasses educational mobility, income is measured with signiﬁcantly
large errors. Focusing on educational attainment, a key determinant of wages, is
easier to observe and quantify, enabling to decrease measurement errors.
Using a novel approach, a series of studies have analysed educational mobility in
Latin America by linking the performance of children currently in the education
system with the educational attainment of parents, using household surveys (see for
example, Behrmann et al. 1999, 2001; Andersen, 2001; Conconi et al. 2007;
Gandelman and Robano 2014). These papers analyse the inﬂuence of parental
background (e.g. income, education) on the success or failure of children in school,
where the outcome is a child’s completed grade and that corresponding to the
child’s cohort. However, the education spells are incomplete and therefore mobility
might not be measured accurately in using this methodology. In this sense, a third
contribution of this paper is that we are able to compare ﬁnal educational
attainments of children with that of their parents.

3 Methodology and data
This section describes the estimation techniques used in this paper to account for
intergenerational educational mobility, as well as a brief description of the dataset
used. We compute three measures of intergenerational educational mobility: the
beta-coefﬁcient, which quantiﬁes the rate of transmission of educational achievements between one generation and the next, the correlation coefﬁcient, which in
addition takes into account the variation in the dispersion of the educational
achievements; and the index of inequality of opportunity, which takes into account
an additional set of observed variables (circumstances) in explaining the intergenerational transmission of educational attainment between parents and children.
Each measure has beneﬁts and limitations. The beta-coefﬁcient is very intuitive
to understand and shows the difference in intergenerational transmission of
education that exists in Latin America compared to the rest of the world. However,
beta-coefﬁcient estimates are in general very volatile, and do not take into account
the variation in the dispersion of educational attainment for parents and children,
which the partial correlation coefﬁcient does. The partial correlation coefﬁcient, in
opportunity, which considers the overall effect of circumstances (race, gender,
family income) in explaining own education.
3.1 Beta- and partial correlation coefﬁcient estimation
The baseline estimation for an individual i in country j is given by:
Eij ¼ a þ bPEij þ eij ;

ð1Þ

where E stands for person i’s own educational attainment, PE the parental educational attainment, and e is a white noise disturbance. This equation allows us the
quantiﬁcation of the importance of parental education on own educational attainment using two related measures. The ﬁrst one is the estimated coefﬁcient of parental education (beta-coefﬁcient). The beta-coefﬁcient shows the relationship
between each additional year of education of parents and own education. A higher
beta-coefﬁcient implies higher persistence and thus lower intergenerational
mobility.
Additionally, one can consider the correlation coefﬁcient between E and PE.12
The correlation coefﬁcient shows how much of the observed dispersion in own
education is explained by parental education. Again, a higher correlation coefﬁcient
implies lower intergenerational mobility. The relationship between the two
measures is as follows: the beta-coefﬁcient equals the correlation coefﬁcient
between own and parental education weighted by the ratio of the standard deviations
of own and parental education:
rE
bj ¼ j qEj ;PEj ;
ð2Þ
rPEj
Therefore, any apparent divergence between the two measures can be due to
changes in the ratio of standard deviations.
Moreover, we include a squared term of parental education, to explore the
possibility of a non-linear relationship between intergenerational education
attainments and also include country ﬁxed-effect, which enables capturing
systematic differences across countries in unobservable factors at the country level
that might be correlated with parental education (adding the term lj), estimating
therefore:
À
Á2
Eij ¼ a þ lj þ bPEij þ d PEij þeij
ð3Þ
and
Eij ¼ a þ lj þ bPEij þ eij ;

ð4Þ

OLS estimates of the above equations are potentially biased upwards if there is
signiﬁcant transmission of ability and other unobservable characteristics from
12
When considering a more general set-up with multiple regressors, these moments are conditional on
Although the debate regarding the relative importance of innate characteristics
versus environmental conditions (‘‘nature versus nurture’’) is not settled (see
¨
Bjorklund et al. 2007), there is evidence that the inheritance of cognitive skills has
only limited importance as a driver of intergenerational mobility (OECD 2008).
3.2 Index of inequality of opportunity estimation
There might be additional variables inﬂuencing own educational achievement that
are correlated with parental education and affecting also the beta-coefﬁcient.
Therefore, in the spirit of Ferreira and Gignoux (2011, 2013), we construct a scalar
measure of inequality of opportunity that combines the overall effect of
circumstances on an individual’s educational attainment. We thus augment the
baseline estimation and consider:
Eij ¼ a þ lj þ bPEij þ uWhiteij þ cFemaleij þ jPIDij þ eij ;

ð5Þ

where White is a binary variable indicating self-reported racial origin; Female is a
binary variable indicating whether individual is female, and PID stands for parent
income ten-quantile classiﬁcation, self-reported by the offspring. Following Ferreira
and Gignoux (2011, 2013) deﬁnitions and calculations, we compute here the overall
effect of (our own deﬁned set of) circumstances on the ﬁnal educational attainment
of individuals and construct an index of inequality of opportunity, a scalar that
measures the proportion of the whole variance that is explained by the set of predeﬁned circumstances. The index of inequality of opportunity (hIOp) that we estimate here for each country j derives from Eq. (5) and is thus:
^
VarðEj Þ
^
;
hIOp ¼
VarðEj Þ

ð6Þ

ˆ
where E comes from the parametric estimation of Eq. (5), the reduced-form
regression of own educational attainment on circumstances, for the average person
within each type of circumstance.13
3.3 Data description
´
Data come from Latinobarometro, a public opinion survey conducted annually in
Latin America. For the 2008 survey, over 20,000 interviews were conducted in 18
Latin American countries. The samples are representative of the national
population. Roughly 1000–1200 interviews by country are conducted, with an
´
estimated 3 % sampling error.14 Despite the smaller sample size of Latinobarometro

13
There are a maximum of 16 years of education, two racial classiﬁcations, two gender classiﬁcations
and ten parental income decile classiﬁcations.
14

in our sample and those resulting from national household surveys.15
Table 1 presents summary statistics of our main variables of interest: (own)
education and parental education.16 In all countries, there is a signiﬁcant increase in
the years of education (and the level attained) from one generation to the other. On
average, the years of education increased by 3 years. At median levels, while
parents’ educational attainment is lower than completed primary education, even at
the 25th percentile of children’s educational distribution, primary education is
completed.
The increase in educational attainment for children has been larger in most
countries that started at very low levels of parental education (e.g. 4.1 years in El
Salvador), although Nicaragua is an exception with the lowest increase, despite
exhibiting low levels of parental educational attainment.
There are also important differences across countries. For example, higher
income countries exhibit systematically higher levels of education across all points
of the distribution. For example, in Argentina and Chile, 50 % of the population has
completed secondary education and the lowest 25 % still have at least completed
primary education. In contrast, Guatemala still exhibits large levels of illiteracy and
even the upper 25 percentile has on average 6.5 years of education, i.e. just a little
bit more than complete primary education.
Finally, in most countries, the data show some intergenerational convergence in
the years of education, as the growth in educational attainment is higher at the lower
end of the distribution. For example, while in most countries the lower 25 percentile
of parents were basically illiterate with zero years of formal education—while in
Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay and Venezuela they had at
least some primary education—many of these countries present increases in
education toward complete primary education. Furthermore, in general, the median
has also beneﬁtted more than the upper 25 percentiles in terms of increases in
educational attainment.17 However, these average trends could be consistent with
very little as well as high levels of intergenerational mobility. Thus, an analysis of
considering the families’ trajectories can provide further insight.

4 Empirical results
In this section, we present the estimates of the three measures of intergenerational
educational mobility outlined above. First, we present the baseline estimations of
the correlations between own and parental educational achievement, comparing
them to the empirical evidence available for other regions, countries and datasets.
Second, we explore potential differences across gender, cohorts and non-linear
15

Using information from CEDLAS SEDLAC database on average years of education in the 18
´
countries covered by Latinobarometro, the average difference in years of education for the population
over 25 years old is 0.04, which is not signiﬁcant at conventional levels of conﬁdence.

Of course, part of the story is that for high levels of education, the offspring is naturally constrained to

Finally, we explore the potential drivers of these cross-country differences across
Latin American countries.
4.1 Pooled beta- and correlation coefﬁcient estimations
In Table 2, we present the estimates for Eqs. (1) and (2), the beta and correlation
coefﬁcient estimates for the population at least 25 years old in 2008. The ﬁrst
column shows that parental education has a statistically signiﬁcant impact for all the
speciﬁcations considered. In terms of the estimated beta-coefﬁcient, an additional
year of parental education increases on average the offspring’s education by
0.65 years (or 0.61 if country dummies are included), a result consistent with the
estimates found by Hertz et al. (2007) for a smaller sample of countries.
The partial correlation coefﬁcient shows that parental education accounts for
around 61.2 % of the dispersion in its offspring’s educational attainment in our
sample. According to Hertz et al. sample of 42 countries, the average correlation

this average is relatively stable across developed and developing regions, with the
exception of Latin America. Thus, parental background explains a signiﬁcantly
higher fraction of the variation in educational attainment in Latin America than
elsewhere. Figure 1 also shows that our pooled estimate for the 18 Latin American
countries in our sample is very close to the average estimate by Hertz et al. (2007)
for the seven countries in their sample for the partial correlation coefﬁcient.
Therefore, these ﬁrst estimates show a consistent picture with the previous
literature on intergenerational educational mobility in emerging economies. While
the beta-coefﬁcient shows that an additional year of parental schooling adds
0.65 years to the child’s educational attainment, a signiﬁcant number but not
based on Eq. (2), as two countries can present the same beta-coefﬁcient, but the
correlation coefﬁcient can be very different if the relative dispersions in parental
and/or child education ﬂuctuate.
Regarding the correlation coefﬁcient measure of mobility, adding the squared
term does not signiﬁcantly increase the importance of parental background, as it
moves just marginally from 0.612 to 0.620.
We analyse next whether this persistence of educational attainments has varied
across cohorts. We estimate Eq. (4) for four separate cohorts, and present the results
in a set of ﬁgures, considering separately the variations by gender.
Figure 2 shows the beta-coefﬁcient estimate, suggesting that the persistence of
educational attainments decreases across cohorts, implying higher levels of mobility
for the younger generations. A quantiﬁcation of the impact of the intergenerational
transmission of educational attainment for individuals in the 25- and 34-year-old
cohort is between 23 and 33 % smaller (women and men, respectively) to those over
55 years old in 2008.
However, the analysis of the correlation coefﬁcient shows that there is no
signiﬁcant change across generations in this measure of educational mobility (see
Fig. 3). There are no signiﬁcant differences by gender.
A plausible explanation for the discrepancy between beta and rho can be due to
changes in the standard deviations of own education rE, and parental education,
rPE. To assess this possibility, the left-hand panel of Fig. 4 shows the steady
increase in average education across cohorts. The right-hand side shows that while
the dispersion of own education has remained fairly constant (with some decline for
younger generations), the dispersion in parental education is signiﬁcantly higher for
younger cohorts. Thus, the b-coefﬁcient is lower for the young cohorts due to the
fact that the standard deviation of parental education is higher for younger cohorts,
as also shown by Daude (2011).

In Table 3, we present the results from estimating Eq. (3), which considers the
possibility of a non-linear relationship between own and parental education. The
new estimates imply that the tipping point, where an additional year of parental
education would start to have a negative effect, is at around 22 years of parental
education, which is well beyond the maximum of 16 years observed in our sample.
This result could be driven by the fact that upward mobility is more common than
downward mobility, such that individuals whose parents had high levels of
education are also likely to remain at the higher end of the distribution, while those
with very low-level parental background can by deﬁnition only move up. In terms of
the correlation coefﬁcient, these estimates are very close to the ones reported in
Table 2. Therefore, non-linearities do not seem to play a major role.
Overall, the estimates presented so far conﬁrm that for both measures our pooled

show that the importance of parental education in explaining differences across their
children’s educational attainment—measured by the correlation coefﬁcient—is very
high compared to other countries and stable across cohorts.
4.2 Index of inequality of opportunity h
In this section, we present the estimates from Eq. (5), augmenting the baseline
estimation to include the effect of additional variables beyond an individual’s
control, such as race (self-reported white versus non-whites), gender, and family
income (self-reported parental income status) in the correlation between parental
and own educational achievements.18 We include these additional observed
variables in the regressions presented in Table 4, both as additional explanatory
variables and also their interactions with parental education allowing for a
differential effect across groups. The results show an index of inequality of
opportunity (hIOp) for the region of around 0.38, in line with Ferreira and Gignoux
(2013) estimates of 0.35 worldwide and above 0.30 for Argentina, Brazil and
Chile).19
The results show that overall the baseline estimates from Table 2 are robust to
the inclusion of these additional controls. While self-reported white individuals
have on average 0.42 more years of education, there is no difference in the
educational mobility between white and non-white individuals (columns 1 and 2).
The interaction term—which is actually negative—is only marginally signiﬁcant at
10 % and economically small. Females present lower levels of educational

Given that there might be other circumstances beyond an individual’s control that are not included in
this regression, the measure of h shall be considered as a lower bound estimate of inequality of
opportunity.

interaction term. The 10-decile classiﬁcation of parental income is associated with
higher levels of educational attainment (see columns 5 and 6). The interaction term
of parental income and parental education is statistically signiﬁcant and negative.
However, it is relatively small and the mean effect dominates. For example, for all
levels below 16 years of parental education, somebody in the highest decile would
have a higher predicted level of education based on the estimates of column (6) than
somebody in the ﬁrst decile.20 Considering all circumstances together (columns 7
and 8) explains more almost 40 % of the variance of own education. Two ﬁnal
issues are of interest. First, adding more controls does not change dramatically the
beta-coefﬁcient (columns 1, 3 and 5), which remains between 0.60 and 0.65, close
the baseline estimate of 0.61 from Table 1. Second, adding the additional controls
does not affect signiﬁcantly the variance explained by the model. While including
only parental education yields a R2 of 0.375 (Table 1), adding parental income, the
gender and white dummies increase the R2 just to 0.382. By contrast, when
excluding parental education, the R2 is just 0.09 (not shown due to space
considerations). Therefore, parental education seems to be a key variable to
understand the external circumstances that condition opportunities.
4.3 Comparisons between countries
Figure 5 shows estimates for both measures of persistence of educational attainment
by country, and their 95 % conﬁdence intervals. There is considerable variation in
the region in both measures. For example, while Costa Rica presents a betacoefﬁcient of 0.36, for Guatemala it is 0.68, almost twice as large. These differences
are economically signiﬁcant. For example, the elasticities imply that a 4-year
difference in parental education would on average imply 1.6 years more of
education for the next generation in Costa Rica, while in Guatemala the equivalent
ﬁgure would be 3.4 years. Given a year of additional education is worth 12 %—the
average return to education in Latin America21—these extra years could translate
into a differential in wage earnings of 19 and 41 %, respectively.22
In general, countries that show low mobility using the beta-coefﬁcient measure
also present low correlation coefﬁcient mobility.23 The case of Chile is somewhat
atypical, given that it ranks relatively well in terms of the beta-coefﬁcient measure,
compared to other countries in the region. However, the correlation coefﬁcient
shows that Chile is second only to Guatemala when measuring intergenerational
mobility by the correlation coefﬁcient (which quantiﬁes the dispersion in
educational achievement within a generation).
In Table 5, we present the estimates of intergenerational mobility by country,
adding a set of circumstances in explaining educational attainment. First, column (1)

shows that the coefﬁcient indicating intergenerational persistence of educational
attainment is always signiﬁcant, and there is no large variation among countries.
Being white (column 2) has a positive signiﬁcant impact on educational persistence in
Argentina, Brazil, Panama and Venezuela, while in Bolivia and Mexico, the impact is
signiﬁcant but negative (thus implying for these two countries that mobility is higher
for the non-white). In column 3, the effect of being female on educational attainment is
shown: females show lower persistence of intergenerational educational attainment in
Bolivia, Chile, El Salvador, Paraguay and Peru. Column 4 shows the coefﬁcient of
parental income classiﬁcation: with the exception of Brazil, parental income is
signiﬁcant in explaining own educational attainment in all countries (Fig. 6).
Furthermore, we compute the index of inequality of opportunity considering the
set of circumstances described above (see Fig. 7). The pattern is very similar to the
one found above by the beta- and the correlation coefﬁcient: in Costa Rica,
circumstances explain the lowest proportion of the variation in own educational
attainment, which implies a higher chance of intergenerational mobility. By
contrast, in Guatemala, Chile and Ecuador, circumstances beyond an individual’s
control explain most of the observed variation in educational attainment.
Therefore, this analysis that includes additional circumstances beyond parental
education shows that these factors vary across country, but overall parental
education is a robust predictor of own education in the region.24 Actually, the

These estimates should be seen as a lower bound of inequality of opportunity, as other relevant
circumstances that are omitted from the analysis are likely to be positively correlated with the explanatory

Inequality of Opportunity

correlation between the index of inequality of opportunities and the correlation
coefﬁcient between parental and own education is 0.98 in our sample. This does not
mean that parental education is a sufﬁcient statistic to understand differences in
This section explores some of the possible determinants of intergenerational
mobility. Rather than presenting causal evidence, it shows some cross-country
correlations to motivate future research in this area. As Angrist and Pischke (2009)
point out, correlation is an important predictor of the existence of causality.
Figure 8 shows the relationship between the beta and partial correlation
coefﬁcient and three variables that economic theory considers potential drivers:
income inequality, the returns to education and public education expenditure (see
the Appendix). To reduce causality problems, we use the earliest available data,
which in general are around the mid-1990s.
In terms of income inequality (measured by the Gini index), there is a positive
correlation with both measures of intergenerational persistence across countries in
the region. The correlation coefﬁcient is 0.44 for the beta-coefﬁcient and 0.37 for
the partial correlation coefﬁcient. Therefore, societies in Latin America that are less
mobile tend also to exhibit high levels of inequality. According to the analytical
framework described in the Appendix, the same factors that affect intergenerational
mobility (private returns to education, progressivity of public investment in
education, and other transmissible factors such as abilities, race and social
networks) also determine the cross-sectional distribution of income in the long run.
In the transition period, a decline in income inequality (perhaps due to changes in
the skill premium or returns to education) or an increase in the progressivity of
public expenditure on education would cause an increase in social mobility.
Figure 8 also shows the correlation of educational mobility and the returns to
primary education. While for the beta-coefﬁcient the correlation between intergenerational persistence and higher returns to education is signiﬁcantly positive, as
predicted above, for the correlation coefﬁcient it is much weaker. A plausible
explanation is that in countries where the returns to education are high—and poor
households face credit constraints—households with higher parental education (and
probably income) will take advantage to investing more in education, while poor
households cannot afford to do so. The weaker link between the partial correlation
coefﬁcient and the returns to primary education might be driven by our small
sample size. In fact, when including also OECD countries, Daude (2011) ﬁnds a
signiﬁcantly positive correlation between the returns to education and the partial
correlation coefﬁcient.
Progressive investment funded by the public sector could equalise opportunities
for children of different social and economic background. The empirical evidence
shows a negative relationship between both measures of the intergenerational
persistence of educational outcomes and public expenditure on education per
student relative to GDP per capita, suggesting that public investment in education
could foster mobility in the region. A remaining problem to solve is on the quality of
education. To be effective, policy actions need to address quality as well as
quantity—as ﬁndings for OECD countries show that how spending on education is
used often matters more than how much is spent.25

Fig. 8 Income inequality and intergeneration persistence in education. Own calculations based on
SEDLAC data and World Bank. Expenditures refer to public expenditure per student in primary
education relative to GDP per capita. Returns to education are from Psacharopoulos and Patrinos (2004)

Public expenditure is only part of the picture. Limited access to credit or savings
can also be a signiﬁcant hurdle to investment in education. In Latin America, credit
access is likely to be holding children back from pursuing further studies.26 The
signiﬁcant correlation between private returns to educational investment and
intergenerational persistence in educational attainments could be mitigated by
increasing the access to ﬁnancial markets and specially designed programs that
reduce borrowing constraints.
Table 6 looks at the statistical signiﬁcance of the three variables considered for
the beta and partial correlation measures. The results conﬁrm our discussion above.
The point estimates for both measures are consistent with what theory would
predict—lower mobility is associated with more income inequality and higher
returns to education and negatively associated with more public expenditure in
education. However, the ﬁt is signiﬁcantly better for the beta-coefﬁcient, where all
variables are signiﬁcant at 10 % (column 4) and explain around 60 % of the cross
country variation. For the correlation coefﬁcient, the variables are only marginally
signiﬁcant, and all together explain around 31 % of the variation across countries.
Based on the regression for the beta-coefﬁcient in Table 6, we can analyse the
relative importance of each factor in explaining the intergenerational persistence in
education by country.27 Figure 9 shows the contribution of each variable in
26

Aiyagari et al. (2003), Becker and Tomes (1979, 1986) and Solon (2004).

Fig. 9 Contribution to intergenerational persistence of education (beta-coefﬁcient) by country

explaining the country’s beta-coefﬁcient. Clearly, although the relative importance
varies by country, in all countries income inequality predicts a signiﬁcant share of
the beta-coefﬁcient. The returns to education play a particularly important role in
the Dominican Republic, explaining around 38 % of the persistence, while there is a
second group of countries where they are important—explaining between 15 and
20 % of the persistence in Uruguay, Brazil, Guatemala and Colombia) and in the
rest of the countries returns do not contribute signiﬁcantly to explaining the level of
intergenerational persistence. In terms of the public expenditure on education, the
largest contribution to reducing intergenerational persistence in education is for
Costa Rica, Panama, and Chile.
Some interesting patterns emerge from this analysis. Costa Rica and Argentina
stand out as countries with relatively low intergenerational persistence of education.
These are countries where income inequality is historically relatively low and a
certain welfare state exists.28 Uruguay shares these characteristics, but it differs by
having higher returns to education, which might reﬂect decades of relative low
public expenditure in education compared to Costa Rica and Argentina (OECD/
ECLAC 2014). This contrasts with Brazil, Ecuador, Dominican Republic and
Guatemala at the other end, which present the highest persistence in educational
attainment. In all countries, income inequality plays a major role, although in the
case of Dominican Republic the returns to education play an important role, as
explained above.

5 Conclusions and some policy implications
The present paper has shown that intergenerational mobility in Latin America is low
and has not signiﬁcantly changed for the latest generations, when measured by the
importance of parental education in explaining their offspring’s educational level.
The picture that emerges is that Latin America is not only the most unequal region
28
See Engerman and Sokoloff (1997) and Williamson (2015) for a historical analysis of income
inequality of opportunity (including dimensions beyond an individual’s control such
as race, gender and parental income background) is estimated at around 40 %,
which is high by international standards. The paper also explores country
differences in intergenerational mobility. While in Costa Rica, circumstances
explain below 15 % of the observed variance in education, in Chile, they amount to
almost half the explained variance. The ﬁndings imply that there might be room for
targeted redistributive policies that improve intergenerational mobility. Next, we
discuss some policies that might mitigate these inequalities and reduce the degree of
intergenerational persistence.
Recent research points towards the importance of early childhood development
(ECD)—comprising cognitive and emotional development as well as adequate
health and nutrition—in boosting opportunities for the disadvantaged in developing
´
countries.29 Conditional cash-transfer programmes (like Bolsa Famılia in Brazil,
Chile Solidario or PROGRESA/Oportunidades in Mexico), which are often
conditional on participation in ECD activities, have shown to be a useful tool for
increasing early childhood investments and protecting these investments from
adverse shocks.30 Evidence from OECD countries shows that higher enrolment rates
and increased public spending on pre-school education in early childhood
signiﬁcantly weakens the link between parental education and child secondary
education performance.31 An expansion of ECD programmes to cover a signiﬁcant
part of the population in Latin America could bring similar beneﬁts. While ECD by
itself is not enough to ensure equal opportunities later on, given its complementarity
with subsequent investments in skills, it is a precondition—and an area where public
policy action could be extremely powerful.
While enrolment rates in primary education in Latin America have generally
reached the Millennium Development Goals, secondary schooling is far from being
universal in most countries in the region. Making secondary education universal is
therefore a natural target for education policy in Latin America. How best to achieve
this goal will vary from country to country depending on its circumstances. For
example, in several countries, compulsory education covers only 9 years of
education ending at age 15). Here, an extension to a 12-year requirement is
feasible—e.g. Argentina went from 10 years of compulsory education to 13 in 2007.
There are second round beneﬁts to this, as compulsory changes in educational level
have transmissible consequences. Evidence from OECD countries—where extensions to mandatory education typically have been at the secondary level—shows
that increases in parental education as a result of the expansion of compulsory
education have a signiﬁcant positive effect on the educational outcomes of their
offspring.32
Grants and student loans are also an important tool in boosting access to tertiary
education. Evidence for OECD countries shows that the probability of students from

On intergenerational (im)mobility in Latin America

Abstract This paper studies intergenerational mobility in Latin America and
shows that, in addition to the well-documented fact that the Latin American income
distribution is highly unequal, profound differences in opportunities persist from
one generation to the next. Comparing ﬁnal educational achievements for 18 Latin
American countries, this paper ﬁnds that measures of the persistence in educational
achievements across generations, such as beta- and partial correlation coefﬁcients,
are high. This persistence is correlated with high returns to education, relatively low
progressivity in public investments in education, and inequality of opportunity. An
index of inequality of opportunity (including dimensions beyond an individual’s
control such as race, gender and parental income background) is estimated at around
40 %, which is high by international standards. The paper also explores country
differences in intergenerational mobility. While in Costa Rica, circumstances
explain below 15 % of the observed variance in education, in Chile, they amount to
almost half the explained variance. The ﬁndings imply that there is room for targeted redistributive policies that improve intergenerational mobility.

The present paper analyses the extent of intergenerational transmission of
educational achievements in 18 Latin American economies. While there is a large
literature on the intergenerational transmission of income and status for developed
economies, the evidence on the extent of intergenerational mobility for emerging
countries is more restricted (due to data limitations).1 In particular, one of the main
problems for the analysis of intergenerational mobility for the Latin American
region is the unavailability of panel data (selected countries, e.g. Chile and Mexico,
have recently started to follow individuals over time) that would enable connecting
the income or wealth for parents with the income of their offspring.2
However, using representative population samples at the country level for a large
number of Latin American countries, this paper can link the educational attainment
of parents with that of their children, measuring intergenerational persistence of
educational attainment. Moreover, we deepen the analysis by considering different
cohorts, as well as the inﬂuence of circumstances (e.g. race, gender, parental income
background). As education is an important driver of labour market income and
measurement errors of parental educational outcomes are much smaller than
income-related variables, this approach, which has also been followed in the
literature for developing countries, can be implemented for a larger number of
countries.
This paper uses three measures of intergenerational educational mobility: the
beta-coefﬁcient, the partial correlation coefﬁcient, and the overall effect of
circumstances beyond an individual’s control (i.e. the index of inequality of
opportunity). All measures coincide in pointing out the relatively low degree of
intergenerational mobility in Latin America and the importance of parental
background in determining educational success.
Within Latin America, there are important differences: while the persistence of
educational attainment is relatively low in Costa Rica, Uruguay, Guatemala and
Argentina (the beta-coefﬁcient of educational attainment is below 50 %), in
Dominican Republic, Venezuela and El Salvador it is above 70 %. The case of
Chile is remarkable, as the beta-coefﬁcient shows that the intergenerational
persistence in educational achievement is 57 %—lower than the average value of
60 %—but the partial correlation coefﬁcient is 67 % and the overall index of
inequality of opportunity is 48 %, the highest value among the sample.
The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section ‘‘Literature review’’
places this paper’s contributions in context by presenting a brief literature review;
Sect. ‘‘Methodology and data’’ describes the conceptual framework to analyse the

earlier survey of the evidence on earning mobility across generations.

Azevedo and Bouillon (2010) review the evidence on intergenerational social mobility by summarising
a set of papers for Latin America, and ﬁnd that intergenerational social mobility is lower than the levels
observed in the United States or the United Kingdom. The authors also note the unavailability of panel
data for the region. Cuesta et al. (2011) use pseudo panels to overcome this problem for a sample of 14
in the empirical assessment. Section ‘‘Empirical results’’ presents the main results
for Latin America and Sect. ‘‘Conclusions and some policy implications’’ discusses
potential implications.

2 Literature review
Income inequality in Latin America is extremely high compared to other emerging
economies as well as high-income countries (e.g. see Hertz et al. 20073; OECD,
2008; Azevedo and Bouillon 2010; Ferreira and Gignoux 2011, 2013; Brunori et al.
2013; Torche 2014). In principle, this type of static income inequality across
individuals (at a certain point in time) does not have to be bad per se, as the
dispersion in earnings could act as a strong incentive for parents to invest in their
children’s education. However, for poor households to be able to grasp these
opportunities, they should have access to well-functioning credit markets, as the
presence of credit constraints reinforces the intergenerational transmission of
income (Aiyagari et al. 2003).4
In principle, educational attainment is a key determinant of wage earnings.
Therefore, differences in acquired education are important to understand static
income inequality.
Hertz et al. (2007) estimate 50-year trends in intergenerational persistence of
educational attainment for 42 countries, ﬁnding the largest intergenerational
correlations in the seven Latin American countries included in their analysis. The
authors ﬁnd that while the beta-coefﬁcient decreased over the last 50 years
(suggesting an increase in intergenerational mobility), no trend is observed for the
partial correlation coefﬁcient. The authors suggest that while both are linear
measures of statistical association and not the true causal effect, the beta-coefﬁcient
might overestimate the true structural parameter of intergenerational mobility due to
the omission of other explanatory variables.
Building on the terminology proposed by Roemer (1998), which distinguishes
between ‘‘efforts’’ (factors that individuals can control) and ‘‘circumstances’’
(factors beyond one’s control, such as race, birthplace, or family background) in
determining ‘‘advantages’’ (outcomes as a result of the combination of circumstances and effort), Ferreira and Gignoux (2011) propose a scalar measure of
inequality of opportunity. They conduct a comparative analysis of six Latin
American countries and ﬁnd that in three of them, inequality of opportunity is linked
to racial origin (indigenous or Afro-descendants).5 In a later study, Brunori et al.
(2013) analyse inequality of opportunity in a comparative form for 41 countries, of
3

Hertz et al. (2007) study the intergenerational transmission of educational outcomes in 50 developed
and developing countries using household surveys. They present results for seven countries from Latin
America: Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Panama, Peru, and Nicaragua.

4

In Latin America, as documented by Tejerina and Westley (2007) using household surveys, the poor
have reduced access to credit and saving instruments.

5

Data for this paper come from nationally representative household surveys dated 1996 for Brazil, 2003
positively correlated with income inequality, and negatively related to intergenerational income and educational mobility. Moreover, they ﬁnd the highest levels of
inequality of opportunity for these six Latin American countries among the whole
sample considered.7
Corak (2013) also links the presence of inequality with lack of opportunities and
of mobility. He argues that the presence of inequality shapes opportunities and in
turn, lack of opportunity lowers mobility.8 By describing the case of the United
States, Corak (2013) argues that the ‘‘American Dream’’ (i.e. prospects for upward
mobility) makes low income earners not strong advocates of redistributive policies,
because of the belief that either they or their descendants can climb the income
ladder.9 Corak (2013) cites Solon (2004) arguing that the Great Gatsby Curve (the
relationship between more income inequality and less intergenerational mobility)
can be due to high returns to education.10 Parents with high education would have
both the capacity and the incentive to invest in their children’s education.
Recently, Torche (2014) discusses the literature on equality of opportunity in a
set of studies for Latin America. The review ﬁnds that parental education is the most
inﬂuential circumstance for an individual, concluding that inequality of opportunity
is higher in Latin America than in industrial countries. Torche argues that the high
(albeit decreasing) returns to education in Latin America can foster mobility, but
they might also create a situation of ‘‘inherited meritocracy’’, because of the barriers
that the lower segments of the income distribution face in accessing education
(quantity and quality). Relatedly, Azevedo and Bouillon (2010) associate the high
levels of immobility in Latin America with social exclusion, low access to higher
education and labour market discrimination.11
If societies do not bring equal opportunities based on merit and ability,
independent of race, gender or social origin, then today’s social and economic status
may be transmitted from parents to their offspring. The focus of this paper is
precisely the analysis of mobility in terms of educational attainment for parents and
children. In particular, a contribution of the paper is enriching the analysis by
considering several dimensions: race, gender and parental income, and analysing the
robustness of the ﬁndings across different measures of intergenerational mobility.

Citing Roemer (1998) and Corak (2013) argues that circumstances affect opportunity by three channels:
social capital, genetic traits, and family values, and that while policies that affect social capital tend to be
accepted, less consensus is placed on policies intending to offset genetic advantages, and within-family
investments.

9

Corak (2013) concludes that relatively less upward mobility of the least advantaged is one of the
reasons why intergenerational mobility in the United States is lower than in other countries. In addition,
Corak (2013) concludes that the persistence at the top 1 % of the income distribution also makes
intergenerational mobility in the United States lower than in other countries.

countries in the region. With the exception of Cuesta et al. (2011), the available
studies generally have covered these issues for a maximum of seven countries, often
with larger samples that allow studying speciﬁc countries in depth. The present
paper’s broader country coverage complements this literature by emphasising both
the common features within the region, as well as the differences across countries.
In contrast to Cuesta et al. (2011), who rely on pseudo cohorts to study
intergenerational income mobility, we use the directly reported own and parental
education level, which allows us to rely on a larger number of observations (in our
sample, we have around 14,000 observations compared to around 1000). This also
allows us to have relatively precise estimates for individual countries and explore
what drives the differences across countries. Furthermore, while income mobility in
principle encompasses educational mobility, income is measured with signiﬁcantly
large errors. Focusing on educational attainment, a key determinant of wages, is
easier to observe and quantify, enabling to decrease measurement errors.
Using a novel approach, a series of studies have analysed educational mobility in
Latin America by linking the performance of children currently in the education
system with the educational attainment of parents, using household surveys (see for
example, Behrmann et al. 1999, 2001; Andersen, 2001; Conconi et al. 2007;
Gandelman and Robano 2014). These papers analyse the inﬂuence of parental
background (e.g. income, education) on the success or failure of children in school,
where the outcome is a child’s completed grade and that corresponding to the
child’s cohort. However, the education spells are incomplete and therefore mobility
might not be measured accurately in using this methodology. In this sense, a third
contribution of this paper is that we are able to compare ﬁnal educational
attainments of children with that of their parents.

3 Methodology and data
This section describes the estimation techniques used in this paper to account for
intergenerational educational mobility, as well as a brief description of the dataset
used. We compute three measures of intergenerational educational mobility: the
beta-coefﬁcient, which quantiﬁes the rate of transmission of educational achievements between one generation and the next, the correlation coefﬁcient, which in
addition takes into account the variation in the dispersion of the educational
achievements; and the index of inequality of opportunity, which takes into account
an additional set of observed variables (circumstances) in explaining the intergenerational transmission of educational attainment between parents and children.
Each measure has beneﬁts and limitations. The beta-coefﬁcient is very intuitive
to understand and shows the difference in intergenerational transmission of
education that exists in Latin America compared to the rest of the world. However,
beta-coefﬁcient estimates are in general very volatile, and do not take into account
the variation in the dispersion of educational attainment for parents and children,
which the partial correlation coefﬁcient does. The partial correlation coefﬁcient, in
opportunity, which considers the overall effect of circumstances (race, gender,
family income) in explaining own education.
3.1 Beta- and partial correlation coefﬁcient estimation
The baseline estimation for an individual i in country j is given by:
Eij ¼ a þ bPEij þ eij ;

ð1Þ

where E stands for person i’s own educational attainment, PE the parental educational attainment, and e is a white noise disturbance. This equation allows us the
quantiﬁcation of the importance of parental education on own educational attainment using two related measures. The ﬁrst one is the estimated coefﬁcient of parental education (beta-coefﬁcient). The beta-coefﬁcient shows the relationship
between each additional year of education of parents and own education. A higher
beta-coefﬁcient implies higher persistence and thus lower intergenerational
mobility.
Additionally, one can consider the correlation coefﬁcient between E and PE.12
The correlation coefﬁcient shows how much of the observed dispersion in own
education is explained by parental education. Again, a higher correlation coefﬁcient
implies lower intergenerational mobility. The relationship between the two
measures is as follows: the beta-coefﬁcient equals the correlation coefﬁcient
between own and parental education weighted by the ratio of the standard deviations
of own and parental education:
rE
bj ¼ j qEj ;PEj ;
ð2Þ
rPEj
Therefore, any apparent divergence between the two measures can be due to
changes in the ratio of standard deviations.
Moreover, we include a squared term of parental education, to explore the
possibility of a non-linear relationship between intergenerational education
attainments and also include country ﬁxed-effect, which enables capturing
systematic differences across countries in unobservable factors at the country level
that might be correlated with parental education (adding the term lj), estimating
therefore:
À
Á2
Eij ¼ a þ lj þ bPEij þ d PEij þeij
ð3Þ
and
Eij ¼ a þ lj þ bPEij þ eij ;

ð4Þ

OLS estimates of the above equations are potentially biased upwards if there is
signiﬁcant transmission of ability and other unobservable characteristics from
12
When considering a more general set-up with multiple regressors, these moments are conditional on
Although the debate regarding the relative importance of innate characteristics
versus environmental conditions (‘‘nature versus nurture’’) is not settled (see
¨
Bjorklund et al. 2007), there is evidence that the inheritance of cognitive skills has
only limited importance as a driver of intergenerational mobility (OECD 2008).
3.2 Index of inequality of opportunity estimation
There might be additional variables inﬂuencing own educational achievement that
are correlated with parental education and affecting also the beta-coefﬁcient.
Therefore, in the spirit of Ferreira and Gignoux (2011, 2013), we construct a scalar
measure of inequality of opportunity that combines the overall effect of
circumstances on an individual’s educational attainment. We thus augment the
baseline estimation and consider:
Eij ¼ a þ lj þ bPEij þ uWhiteij þ cFemaleij þ jPIDij þ eij ;

ð5Þ

where White is a binary variable indicating self-reported racial origin; Female is a
binary variable indicating whether individual is female, and PID stands for parent
income ten-quantile classiﬁcation, self-reported by the offspring. Following Ferreira
and Gignoux (2011, 2013) deﬁnitions and calculations, we compute here the overall
effect of (our own deﬁned set of) circumstances on the ﬁnal educational attainment
of individuals and construct an index of inequality of opportunity, a scalar that
measures the proportion of the whole variance that is explained by the set of predeﬁned circumstances. The index of inequality of opportunity (hIOp) that we estimate here for each country j derives from Eq. (5) and is thus:
^
VarðEj Þ
^
;
hIOp ¼
VarðEj Þ

ˆ
where E comes from the parametric estimation of Eq. (5), the reduced-form
regression of own educational attainment on circumstances, for the average person
within each type of circumstance.13
3.3 Data description
´
Data come from Latinobarometro, a public opinion survey conducted annually in
Latin America. For the 2008 survey, over 20,000 interviews were conducted in 18
Latin American countries. The samples are representative of the national
population. Roughly 1000–1200 interviews by country are conducted, with an
´
estimated 3 % sampling error.14 Despite the smaller sample size of Latinobarometro

13
There are a maximum of 16 years of education, two racial classiﬁcations, two gender classiﬁcations
and ten parental income decile classiﬁcations.
14

in our sample and those resulting from national household surveys.15
Table 1 presents summary statistics of our main variables of interest: (own)
education and parental education.16 In all countries, there is a signiﬁcant increase in
the years of education (and the level attained) from one generation to the other. On
average, the years of education increased by 3 years. At median levels, while
parents’ educational attainment is lower than completed primary education, even at
the 25th percentile of children’s educational distribution, primary education is
completed.
The increase in educational attainment for children has been larger in most
countries that started at very low levels of parental education (e.g. 4.1 years in El
Salvador), although Nicaragua is an exception with the lowest increase, despite
exhibiting low levels of parental educational attainment.
There are also important differences across countries. For example, higher
income countries exhibit systematically higher levels of education across all points
of the distribution. For example, in Argentina and Chile, 50 % of the population has
completed secondary education and the lowest 25 % still have at least completed
primary education. In contrast, Guatemala still exhibits large levels of illiteracy and
even the upper 25 percentile has on average 6.5 years of education, i.e. just a little
bit more than complete primary education.
Finally, in most countries, the data show some intergenerational convergence in
the years of education, as the growth in educational attainment is higher at the lower
end of the distribution. For example, while in most countries the lower 25 percentile
of parents were basically illiterate with zero years of formal education—while in
Argentina, Chile, Colombia, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay and Venezuela they had at
least some primary education—many of these countries present increases in
education toward complete primary education. Furthermore, in general, the median
has also beneﬁtted more than the upper 25 percentiles in terms of increases in
educational attainment.17 However, these average trends could be consistent with
very little as well as high levels of intergenerational mobility. Thus, an analysis of
considering the families’ trajectories can provide further insight.

4 Empirical results
In this section, we present the estimates of the three measures of intergenerational
educational mobility outlined above. First, we present the baseline estimations of
the correlations between own and parental educational achievement, comparing
them to the empirical evidence available for other regions, countries and datasets.
Second, we explore potential differences across gender, cohorts and non-linear
15

Using information from CEDLAS SEDLAC database on average years of education in the 18
´
countries covered by Latinobarometro, the average difference in years of education for the population
over 25 years old is 0.04, which is not signiﬁcant at conventional levels of conﬁdence.

Of course, part of the story is that for high levels of education, the offspring is naturally constrained to

effects. Third, we explore differences across countries in intergenerational mobility.
Finally, we explore the potential drivers of these cross-country differences across
Latin American countries.
4.1 Pooled beta- and correlation coefﬁcient estimations
In Table 2, we present the estimates for Eqs. (1) and (2), the beta and correlation
coefﬁcient estimates for the population at least 25 years old in 2008. The ﬁrst
column shows that parental education has a statistically signiﬁcant impact for all the
speciﬁcations considered. In terms of the estimated beta-coefﬁcient, an additional
year of parental education increases on average the offspring’s education by
0.65 years (or 0.61 if country dummies are included), a result consistent with the
estimates found by Hertz et al. (2007) for a smaller sample of countries.
The partial correlation coefﬁcient shows that parental education accounts for
around 61.2 % of the dispersion in its offspring’s educational attainment in our
sample. According to Hertz et al. sample of 42 countries, the average correlation

countries

this average is relatively stable across developed and developing regions, with the
exception of Latin America. Thus, parental background explains a signiﬁcantly
higher fraction of the variation in educational attainment in Latin America than
elsewhere. Figure 1 also shows that our pooled estimate for the 18 Latin American
countries in our sample is very close to the average estimate by Hertz et al. (2007)
for the seven countries in their sample for the partial correlation coefﬁcient.
Therefore, these ﬁrst estimates show a consistent picture with the previous
literature on intergenerational educational mobility in emerging economies. While
the beta-coefﬁcient shows that an additional year of parental schooling adds
0.65 years to the child’s educational attainment, a signiﬁcant number but not
based on Eq. (2), as two countries can present the same beta-coefﬁcient, but the
correlation coefﬁcient can be very different if the relative dispersions in parental
and/or child education ﬂuctuate.
Regarding the correlation coefﬁcient measure of mobility, adding the squared
term does not signiﬁcantly increase the importance of parental background, as it
moves just marginally from 0.612 to 0.620.
We analyse next whether this persistence of educational attainments has varied
across cohorts. We estimate Eq. (4) for four separate cohorts, and present the results
in a set of ﬁgures, considering separately the variations by gender.
Figure 2 shows the beta-coefﬁcient estimate, suggesting that the persistence of
educational attainments decreases across cohorts, implying higher levels of mobility
for the younger generations. A quantiﬁcation of the impact of the intergenerational
transmission of educational attainment for individuals in the 25- and 34-year-old
cohort is between 23 and 33 % smaller (women and men, respectively) to those over
55 years old in 2008.
However, the analysis of the correlation coefﬁcient shows that there is no
signiﬁcant change across generations in this measure of educational mobility (see
Fig. 3). There are no signiﬁcant differences by gender.
A plausible explanation for the discrepancy between beta and rho can be due to
changes in the standard deviations of own education rE, and parental education,
rPE. To assess this possibility, the left-hand panel of Fig. 4 shows the steady
increase in average education across cohorts. The right-hand side shows that while
the dispersion of own education has remained fairly constant (with some decline for
younger generations), the dispersion in parental education is signiﬁcantly higher for
younger cohorts. Thus, the b-coefﬁcient is lower for the young cohorts due to the
fact that the standard deviation of parental education is higher for younger cohorts,
as also shown by Daude (2011).

In Table 3, we present the results from estimating Eq. (3), which considers the
possibility of a non-linear relationship between own and parental education. The
new estimates imply that the tipping point, where an additional year of parental
education would start to have a negative effect, is at around 22 years of parental
education, which is well beyond the maximum of 16 years observed in our sample.
This result could be driven by the fact that upward mobility is more common than
downward mobility, such that individuals whose parents had high levels of
education are also likely to remain at the higher end of the distribution, while those
with very low-level parental background can by deﬁnition only move up. In terms of
the correlation coefﬁcient, these estimates are very close to the ones reported in
Table 2. Therefore, non-linearities do not seem to play a major role.
Overall, the estimates presented so far conﬁrm that for both measures our pooled

mobility, despite differences in sampling and years covered. Our estimates also
show that the importance of parental education in explaining differences across their
children’s educational attainment—measured by the correlation coefﬁcient—is very
high compared to other countries and stable across cohorts.
4.2 Index of inequality of opportunity h
In this section, we present the estimates from Eq. (5), augmenting the baseline
estimation to include the effect of additional variables beyond an individual’s
control, such as race (self-reported white versus non-whites), gender, and family
income (self-reported parental income status) in the correlation between parental
and own educational achievements.18 We include these additional observed
variables in the regressions presented in Table 4, both as additional explanatory
variables and also their interactions with parental education allowing for a
differential effect across groups. The results show an index of inequality of
opportunity (hIOp) for the region of around 0.38, in line with Ferreira and Gignoux
(2013) estimates of 0.35 worldwide and above 0.30 for Argentina, Brazil and
Chile).19
The results show that overall the baseline estimates from Table 2 are robust to
the inclusion of these additional controls. While self-reported white individuals
have on average 0.42 more years of education, there is no difference in the
educational mobility between white and non-white individuals (columns 1 and 2).
The interaction term—which is actually negative—is only marginally signiﬁcant at
10 % and economically small. Females present lower levels of educational

Given that there might be other circumstances beyond an individual’s control that are not included in
this regression, the measure of h shall be considered as a lower bound estimate of inequality of
opportunity.

interaction term. The 10-decile classiﬁcation of parental income is associated with
higher levels of educational attainment (see columns 5 and 6). The interaction term
of parental income and parental education is statistically signiﬁcant and negative.
However, it is relatively small and the mean effect dominates. For example, for all
levels below 16 years of parental education, somebody in the highest decile would
have a higher predicted level of education based on the estimates of column (6) than
somebody in the ﬁrst decile.20 Considering all circumstances together (columns 7
and 8) explains more almost 40 % of the variance of own education. Two ﬁnal
issues are of interest. First, adding more controls does not change dramatically the
beta-coefﬁcient (columns 1, 3 and 5), which remains between 0.60 and 0.65, close
the baseline estimate of 0.61 from Table 1. Second, adding the additional controls
does not affect signiﬁcantly the variance explained by the model. While including
only parental education yields a R2 of 0.375 (Table 1), adding parental income, the
gender and white dummies increase the R2 just to 0.382. By contrast, when
excluding parental education, the R2 is just 0.09 (not shown due to space
considerations). Therefore, parental education seems to be a key variable to
understand the external circumstances that condition opportunities.
4.3 Comparisons between countries
Figure 5 shows estimates for both measures of persistence of educational attainment
by country, and their 95 % conﬁdence intervals. There is considerable variation in
the region in both measures. For example, while Costa Rica presents a betacoefﬁcient of 0.36, for Guatemala it is 0.68, almost twice as large. These differences
are economically signiﬁcant. For example, the elasticities imply that a 4-year
difference in parental education would on average imply 1.6 years more of
education for the next generation in Costa Rica, while in Guatemala the equivalent
ﬁgure would be 3.4 years. Given a year of additional education is worth 12 %—the
average return to education in Latin America21—these extra years could translate
into a differential in wage earnings of 19 and 41 %, respectively.22
In general, countries that show low mobility using the beta-coefﬁcient measure
also present low correlation coefﬁcient mobility.23 The case of Chile is somewhat
atypical, given that it ranks relatively well in terms of the beta-coefﬁcient measure,
compared to other countries in the region. However, the correlation coefﬁcient
shows that Chile is second only to Guatemala when measuring intergenerational
mobility by the correlation coefﬁcient (which quantiﬁes the dispersion in
educational achievement within a generation).
In Table 5, we present the estimates of intergenerational mobility by country,
adding a set of circumstances in explaining educational attainment. First, column (1)

This effect is even larger as income and education are positively correlated (0.33 in our sample).

shows that the coefﬁcient indicating intergenerational persistence of educational
attainment is always signiﬁcant, and there is no large variation among countries.
Being white (column 2) has a positive signiﬁcant impact on educational persistence in
Argentina, Brazil, Panama and Venezuela, while in Bolivia and Mexico, the impact is
signiﬁcant but negative (thus implying for these two countries that mobility is higher
for the non-white). In column 3, the effect of being female on educational attainment is
shown: females show lower persistence of intergenerational educational attainment in
Bolivia, Chile, El Salvador, Paraguay and Peru. Column 4 shows the coefﬁcient of
parental income classiﬁcation: with the exception of Brazil, parental income is
signiﬁcant in explaining own educational attainment in all countries (Fig. 6).
Furthermore, we compute the index of inequality of opportunity considering the
set of circumstances described above (see Fig. 7). The pattern is very similar to the
one found above by the beta- and the correlation coefﬁcient: in Costa Rica,
circumstances explain the lowest proportion of the variation in own educational
attainment, which implies a higher chance of intergenerational mobility. By
contrast, in Guatemala, Chile and Ecuador, circumstances beyond an individual’s
control explain most of the observed variation in educational attainment.
Therefore, this analysis that includes additional circumstances beyond parental
education shows that these factors vary across country, but overall parental
education is a robust predictor of own education in the region.24 Actually, the

These estimates should be seen as a lower bound of inequality of opportunity, as other relevant
circumstances that are omitted from the analysis are likely to be positively correlated with the explanatory

Inequality of Opportunity

Fig. 7 Index of Inequality of opportunity

correlation between the index of inequality of opportunities and the correlation
coefﬁcient between parental and own education is 0.98 in our sample. This does not
mean that parental education is a sufﬁcient statistic to understand differences in
This section explores some of the possible determinants of intergenerational
mobility. Rather than presenting causal evidence, it shows some cross-country
correlations to motivate future research in this area. As Angrist and Pischke (2009)
point out, correlation is an important predictor of the existence of causality.
Figure 8 shows the relationship between the beta and partial correlation
coefﬁcient and three variables that economic theory considers potential drivers:
income inequality, the returns to education and public education expenditure (see
the Appendix). To reduce causality problems, we use the earliest available data,
which in general are around the mid-1990s.
In terms of income inequality (measured by the Gini index), there is a positive
correlation with both measures of intergenerational persistence across countries in
the region. The correlation coefﬁcient is 0.44 for the beta-coefﬁcient and 0.37 for
the partial correlation coefﬁcient. Therefore, societies in Latin America that are less
mobile tend also to exhibit high levels of inequality. According to the analytical
framework described in the Appendix, the same factors that affect intergenerational
mobility (private returns to education, progressivity of public investment in
education, and other transmissible factors such as abilities, race and social
networks) also determine the cross-sectional distribution of income in the long run.
In the transition period, a decline in income inequality (perhaps due to changes in
the skill premium or returns to education) or an increase in the progressivity of
public expenditure on education would cause an increase in social mobility.
Figure 8 also shows the correlation of educational mobility and the returns to
primary education. While for the beta-coefﬁcient the correlation between intergenerational persistence and higher returns to education is signiﬁcantly positive, as
predicted above, for the correlation coefﬁcient it is much weaker. A plausible
explanation is that in countries where the returns to education are high—and poor
households face credit constraints—households with higher parental education (and
probably income) will take advantage to investing more in education, while poor
households cannot afford to do so. The weaker link between the partial correlation
coefﬁcient and the returns to primary education might be driven by our small
sample size. In fact, when including also OECD countries, Daude (2011) ﬁnds a
signiﬁcantly positive correlation between the returns to education and the partial
correlation coefﬁcient.
Progressive investment funded by the public sector could equalise opportunities
for children of different social and economic background. The empirical evidence
shows a negative relationship between both measures of the intergenerational
persistence of educational outcomes and public expenditure on education per
student relative to GDP per capita, suggesting that public investment in education
could foster mobility in the region. A remaining problem to solve is on the quality of
education. To be effective, policy actions need to address quality as well as
quantity—as ﬁndings for OECD countries show that how spending on education is
used often matters more than how much is spent.25

returns to prim. education early 1990s

expenditure per student/GDP per capita

Fig. 8 Income inequality and intergeneration persistence in education. Own calculations based on
SEDLAC data and World Bank. Expenditures refer to public expenditure per student in primary
education relative to GDP per capita. Returns to education are from Psacharopoulos and Patrinos (2004)

Public expenditure is only part of the picture. Limited access to credit or savings
can also be a signiﬁcant hurdle to investment in education. In Latin America, credit
access is likely to be holding children back from pursuing further studies.26 The
signiﬁcant correlation between private returns to educational investment and
intergenerational persistence in educational attainments could be mitigated by
increasing the access to ﬁnancial markets and specially designed programs that
reduce borrowing constraints.
Table 6 looks at the statistical signiﬁcance of the three variables considered for
the beta and partial correlation measures. The results conﬁrm our discussion above.
The point estimates for both measures are consistent with what theory would
predict—lower mobility is associated with more income inequality and higher
returns to education and negatively associated with more public expenditure in
education. However, the ﬁt is signiﬁcantly better for the beta-coefﬁcient, where all
variables are signiﬁcant at 10 % (column 4) and explain around 60 % of the cross
country variation. For the correlation coefﬁcient, the variables are only marginally
signiﬁcant, and all together explain around 31 % of the variation across countries.
Based on the regression for the beta-coefﬁcient in Table 6, we can analyse the
relative importance of each factor in explaining the intergenerational persistence in
education by country.27 Figure 9 shows the contribution of each variable in

Fig. 9 Contribution to intergenerational persistence of education (beta-coefﬁcient) by country

explaining the country’s beta-coefﬁcient. Clearly, although the relative importance
varies by country, in all countries income inequality predicts a signiﬁcant share of
the beta-coefﬁcient. The returns to education play a particularly important role in
the Dominican Republic, explaining around 38 % of the persistence, while there is a
second group of countries where they are important—explaining between 15 and
20 % of the persistence in Uruguay, Brazil, Guatemala and Colombia) and in the
rest of the countries returns do not contribute signiﬁcantly to explaining the level of
intergenerational persistence. In terms of the public expenditure on education, the
largest contribution to reducing intergenerational persistence in education is for
Costa Rica, Panama, and Chile.
Some interesting patterns emerge from this analysis. Costa Rica and Argentina
stand out as countries with relatively low intergenerational persistence of education.
These are countries where income inequality is historically relatively low and a
certain welfare state exists.28 Uruguay shares these characteristics, but it differs by
having higher returns to education, which might reﬂect decades of relative low
public expenditure in education compared to Costa Rica and Argentina (OECD/
ECLAC 2014). This contrasts with Brazil, Ecuador, Dominican Republic and
Guatemala at the other end, which present the highest persistence in educational
attainment. In all countries, income inequality plays a major role, although in the
case of Dominican Republic the returns to education play an important role, as
explained above.

5 Conclusions and some policy implications
The present paper has shown that intergenerational mobility in Latin America is low
and has not signiﬁcantly changed for the latest generations, when measured by the
importance of parental education in explaining their offspring’s educational level.
The picture that emerges is that Latin America is not only the most unequal region
28
See Engerman and Sokoloff (1997) and Williamson (2015) for a historical analysis of income
inequality of opportunity (including dimensions beyond an individual’s control such
as race, gender and parental income background) is estimated at around 40 %,
which is high by international standards. The paper also explores country
differences in intergenerational mobility. While in Costa Rica, circumstances
explain below 15 % of the observed variance in education, in Chile, they amount to
almost half the explained variance. The ﬁndings imply that there might be room for
targeted redistributive policies that improve intergenerational mobility. Next, we
discuss some policies that might mitigate these inequalities and reduce the degree of
intergenerational persistence.
Recent research points towards the importance of early childhood development
(ECD)—comprising cognitive and emotional development as well as adequate
health and nutrition—in boosting opportunities for the disadvantaged in developing
´
countries.29 Conditional cash-transfer programmes (like Bolsa Famılia in Brazil,
Chile Solidario or PROGRESA/Oportunidades in Mexico), which are often
conditional on participation in ECD activities, have shown to be a useful tool for
increasing early childhood investments and protecting these investments from
adverse shocks.30 Evidence from OECD countries shows that higher enrolment rates
and increased public spending on pre-school education in early childhood
signiﬁcantly weakens the link between parental education and child secondary
education performance.31 An expansion of ECD programmes to cover a signiﬁcant
part of the population in Latin America could bring similar beneﬁts. While ECD by
itself is not enough to ensure equal opportunities later on, given its complementarity
with subsequent investments in skills, it is a precondition—and an area where public
policy action could be extremely powerful.
While enrolment rates in primary education in Latin America have generally
reached the Millennium Development Goals, secondary schooling is far from being
universal in most countries in the region. Making secondary education universal is
therefore a natural target for education policy in Latin America. How best to achieve
this goal will vary from country to country depending on its circumstances. For
example, in several countries, compulsory education covers only 9 years of
education ending at age 15). Here, an extension to a 12-year requirement is
feasible—e.g. Argentina went from 10 years of compulsory education to 13 in 2007.
There are second round beneﬁts to this, as compulsory changes in educational level
have transmissible consequences. Evidence from OECD countries—where extensions to mandatory education typically have been at the secondary level—shows
that increases in parental education as a result of the expansion of compulsory
education have a signiﬁcant positive effect on the educational outcomes of their
offspring.32
Grants and student loans are also an important tool in boosting access to tertiary
education. Evidence for OECD countries shows that the probability of students from

less favourable family backgrounds completing tertiary studies is higher in countries
that provide funding available to all students.
Finally, many other social policies might be complementary to the ones
previously mentioned. Better access to unemployment insurance, health services
and social protection would allow families to withstand the kind of liquidity shocks
that currently often require teenagers to postpone or abandon their studies to provide
supplementary income for the household. It is important to consider the institutional
capacities of each country and to conduct a careful evaluation of what policy might
be best in each case.

Appendix
This appendix presents a brief sketch of a model by Solon (2004) that is useful to
analyse the intergenerational transmission of income and to assess the central role of
education.
We assume that the parental budget constraint of household i is given by:
ð1 À gÞyitÀ1 ¼ CitÀ1 þ IitÀ1 ;

ð7Þ

where the left-hand represents disposable income and g is the tax rate, C is parental
consumption and I is investment in the offspring’s education. The parent’s utility
function is given by:
UitÀ1 ¼ ð1 À aÞ log CitÀ1 þ a log yit ;

ð8Þ

such that parent care about the own consumption and their offspring’s income level.
Educational attainment is composed by two parts: a deliberate accumulation process

ð9Þ

The inheritable endowments follow a stationary autoregressive process of order
one given by:
eit ¼ d þ keitÀ1 þ vit ;

ð10Þ

where the last term is a white noise random shock. These endowments should be
interpreted in a broad sense. They include innate ability, but also other attributes
that are determined by the family’s network, race, or culture. Educational attainment
increases income via a standard Mincer equation, given by:
log yit ¼ l þ phit :

ð11Þ

Following Solon (2004), public policy can be represented by:
GitÀ1
ﬃ / À c log yitÀ1 ;
ð1 À sÞyitÀ1

ð12Þ

where c [ 0. According to this equation, public investment in children’s educational attainment is progressive in relative terms, as public investment as a fraction
of parental disposable income decreases with the level of income. Utility maximisation and operating yields the following steady-state relationship between
parental and own education:

ð13Þ
An OLS estimation of Eq. (13) would be biased and inconsistent, as the error
term is correlated with the parent’s education. However, it is straightforward to
show that the correct steady-state measure of intergenerational transmission of
educational attainments (w) is given by:
w¼

hpð1 À cÞ þ k
:
1 þ hpð1 À cÞk

ð14Þ

Thus, in theory, the degree of intergeneration transmission is an increasing
function of the productivity of educational attainments (h), the returns to education
(p) and the persistence in intergenerational inheritance of skills and other relevant
characteristics (k), while more progressivity of public investment in education (c)
increases intergenerational educational mobility. Differences across countries
should therefore be related to differences in these parameters.
Furthermore, using Eqs. (11) and (13), the variance in steady-state (log) income

where is the variance of the innovation term in Eq. (10). Therefore, in steady state,
the dispersion in income increases with the degree of inheritability (k), the productivity of educational investments (h), and the returns to education (p), and
decreases with the progressivity of public policies (c), just like the intergeneration
elasticity (see Eq. 14).
However, there is no one-to-one mapping between intergenerational mobility and
inequality, as the latter depends also on the dispersion of income-related
characteristics that are not included in the beta-coefﬁcient measure used in our
analysis.
