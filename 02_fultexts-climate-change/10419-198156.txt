INTRODUCTION

Starting from the beginning of the previous decade, the new notion of degrowth - for many
years known only by experts in the field - has penetrated the academic, public and political spheres,
rapidly gaining notoriety particularly in Europe.
Only recently being used in economic and social debates, the degrowth perspectives are
founded as a reaction to the unsustainable trend of the current global development, coming from
intellectual sources that cover a relatively old history such as ecology and bioeconomy-and from the
addressing the limits to growth. This has become today both a practical necessity and a moral
imperative. The degrowth promoters add to this drawback a critique that is central in their
discourse: the natural social order. They are denying the contemporary order, insisting on people`s
liberation from the socio-economic imagery generated by the imperative of growth that reduces
people to simple production tools or to consumption units.
Thus degrowth movement implies a synthesis of social objectives (a development that
benefits all, that serves people and it is not served by people, qualitative and not quantitative) and of
ecological concerns (the sustainability of this development).
The paper`s aim is to conceptualize degrowth and to provide an overview of the chronological
landmarks that have brought to the fore the watchword of degrowth. The first section provides an
interpretation of the definitions of degrowth, drawing its main features. Section two and section
three emphasize the development of degrowth movement in France and its increasing audience in
several European countries, focusing on the tools and actors that served for its divulgation. T he
final part provides conclusions summarizing the main points of the paper and suggestions for
further research.

1.

DEFINING DEGROWTH

Key advocates of degrowth state clearly that degrowth it is not a concept per se but “a
political slogan with theoretical implications” (Bayon, Fabrice and Smith, 2011, p. 14; Latouche,
2010a, p. 17, 2010b, p. 519, 2007, p. 20), “a missile word for pulverizing the ideology in which
both the right and the left are swimming”(Ariès, 2010, p. 81; 2007, p. 159; 2005, p. 75), a “political
weapon to decolonize the collective imaginary and free it from the tyranny of growth” (Latouche,
2005a). Thus degrowth is not presented as a doctrine, a program, an ideology or another economic
theory (Martinez Allier et al., 2010, p. 1742; Flipo, 2008, p.26), but as “a symbolic challenge”
(Latouche, 2006b) to policies that herald economic growth as an end in itself. Degrowth is not to be
turned into a blueprint or an end in itself, but to remain a means for fostering a spirit of critique
(Ariès, 2005), for questioning the priority accorded to economic values and principles.
Due to the variety of sources, its complexity and multidimensional forms of expression, it is a
challenge to agree on a clear cut definition for degrowth. Another fellow degrowt h advocate, aware
of the dangers entitled by abstract ideas, Kallis (2010b), stated that degrowth is not meant to be a
complete theory or a new type of „„religion‟‟. In this sense he uttered that “if one is looking for a

fighting against”. Indeed, the lack of clear delimitation allows new forms of expressions of the
degrowth movement to move along the dynamic it entails. But at the same time, while having
positive implications by allowing freedom of interpretation, the lack of a common language for
foregrounding degrowth has negative outcomes such as the fact that it might create confusion. As
we will see below, Kallis (2010, p. 874) gives himself a definition in an attempt of defending
degrowth.
There is not a single referential text about sustainable degrowth that has yet found its way to
the wider academic and political arena, it was the case of the Brundtland Report or the Rio
Declaration for Sustainable Development in 1992 (Martinez Allier et al., 2010, p. 1742).
Commonly, degrowth appears as a potential emergent paradigm that can give a substantial
contribution in reversing the unsustainable path we are in. If this path is to be followed, its
promoters have to be able to describe clearly what degrowth is about.
In the French dictionary Larousse Illustré of 2010 degrowth is defined as policies promoting
a slowdown of the growth rate in a sustainable development perspective (Lavignotte, 2009, p.12).
The editors from The Institute of Economic and Social Studies for a Sustainable Degrowth stress
that this definition is totally flawed as its advocates (Ariès, 2010, 2008; Latouche, 2011a, 2011b,
2010) make clear that degrowth is not “negative growth” – but “an absurd and oxymoronical
expression that translates to a large extent the domination of the growth imagery” Latouche (2007,
p.21). Moreover the literature on degrowth issues provides an important body of virulent critiques
to sustainable development (Latouche, 2011b, 2010a, 2006, p. 30, 2004b, p. 51; Bayon et al., 2010,
pp.81-102; Bonaiuti, 2010, p. 2; Ariès, 2010, p. 258, 2009, p. 13; Pallante, 2009, p. 20; Fournier,
2008, p. 539; Wallenborn, 2008, pp. 228-229;)
Thus, according to IESSSD “degrowth reflects policies for promoting degrowth of the rich
countries, mostly, and aiming at escaping the economism (invasion of all the human and social
dimensions by the economy) (…) Sustainable degrowth is opposing the supporters of sustainable
development who believe that economic growth can be conjugated with the environmental
protection” (Lavignotte, 2009, p. 12).
One of the first attempts to give a comprehensive definition of degrowth comes from the
Conference on Economic De-growth for Ecological Sustainability and Social Equity held in Paris
(2008). Several academicians that approached the subject provided definitions based on their
consideration on degrowth. The table below presents a selection of definitions of degrowth from the

by authors from France, Spain and Italy.
Table 1 – Selected Definitions of Degrowth
Definiti ons of degrowth
“a voluntary transition towards a just, participatory, and ecologically sustainable society.
The objectives of degrowth are to meet basic human needs and ensure a high quality of
life, while reducing the ecological impact of the global economy to a sustain able level,
equitably distributed between nations”.
“(A society of degrowth) should be understood as a society built on quality rather than on
quantity, on cooperation rather than on competition […] hu manity liberated from
economis m for wh ich social justice is the objective”.
„Sustainable degrowth is both a banner associated with social and environmental
movements and an emergent concept in academic and intellectual circles, they are
interdependent and affect each other”.
“Sustainable degrowth can be defined from an ecological–economic perspective as a
socially sustainable and equitable reduction (and eventually stabilization) of society's
throughput”.
“Degrowth proposes the promotion of the most ample substitution possible of the goods
industrially produced and purchased in the commercial route with the autoproduction of
goods. In this choice, that implies a decrease of the GDP, we identify the possibil ity of an
extraordinary imp rovement of the individual and collective life, of the environmental
conditions and of the relations between peoples, states and culture”.
“Sustainable degrowth may be defined as an equitable downscaling of production and
consumption that increases human wellbeing and enhances ecological conditions at the
local and global level, in the short and long term”.

We distinguish from these definitions the key features that describe de notion of degrowth:
First, degrowth appears as a transition that requires a transformation of the global economic
system. As important advocates of degrowth clearly explain (Latouche, 2010, p. 521), the
movement does not advocate for degrowth for the sake of degrowth, an approach that would
describe the same symmetry of the imperative for chrematistic growth and would be absurd, but
degrowth is a process that aims at reversing the unsustainable path of our development. This feature
of escaping from the economy is seen by many authors as a critical one. Latouche (2010, p. 519,
2008; 2007, p. 22) states that it would be best to speak about “agrowth” instead of degrowth, as one
speaks as atheism: “It actually means quite precisely, the abandonment of a religion: the religion of
the economy, growth, progress and development”. In this sense, as Valerie Fournier clearly
emphasized as well (2008, p. 528), the degrowth movement‟s over-arching theme is escaping from
the economy as system of representation. In accordance with a humanist approach - this Cultural
Revolution is indispensable in order to achieve a life style change that is not only accepted and
unconstrained, but translated into development of the “enjoyment of life” (Lavignotte, 2009, p. 13).

important dimension of degrowth. But more than a decrease of consumption and production what is
also needed is the decolonization of the so called economic imagery. The “logic of economy”
requires a new approach, the myth of “limitless growth” needs to be abandoned because after
colonizing all territories of material goods and most part of the territories of services, “the
commodification has sent its vanguard on the mental territories” (Pallante, 2009, p. 12). Therefore
there is a need of an ecology of mind for decolonization of the mental environment.
Second, the obvious objective of degrowth is the reduction of the ecological impact through
the downscaling of production and consumption. Degrowth goes beyond decoupling material and
energy use from growth (dematerialization or green growth), postulating that efficiency
improvements alone are not sufficient and might be counterproductive (Schneider, 2010, p. 512)
because it would consist in a reduction of environmental impact through more efficient or cleaner
technologies, while keeping production and consumption growing, as indicated by the Jevons
Paradox (Polimeni et al., 2008; Polimeni & Polimeni, 2006). In this sense, degrowth advocates are
very firm concerning the distinction between sustainable development and sustainable degrowth
(Ariès, 2010, p. 13; Bonaiuti, 2010; Fournier, 2008, p. 539; Latouche, 2004b, p. 51; Levallois,
2010; Pallante, 2009, p. 20).
A third feature is that this transition is voluntary and participatory, therefore the process of
degrowth is democratic. It is widely accepted within the reference literature, that a definition of
degrowth based only on the reduction of metabolism in terms of material and energy flows
translates in a limited understanding of degrowth. For the degrowth scholars degrowth appears as
the result of a collective choice for a better living, not an imperative imposed by an external
authority. Therefore, degrowth is not defended as a necessity but as a choice, one that has to be
made democratically and openly (Latouche and Harpages, 2010, p. 38; Fournier, 2008; Flipo, 2008;
Schneider, 2010b; Latouche, 2010; Ariès, 2010; Mylondo, 2008, p. 175). Valerie Fournier clearly
emphasized this feature in a widely cited article: “Degrowth is offered as a way of avoiding
„„ecocracy‟‟ in the future, a path we could chose today to remain in a position to collectively and
democratically shape our future in the face of ecological degradation. The more we wait, the more
the shock imposed by the earth natural limits might be brutal and the risk of emerging
„„ecototalitarian‟‟ responses high. But whilst recognizing the threat of environmental degradation,
proponents of degrowth are not prepared to sacrifice democracy to some ecological imperative any
more than to economic or political imperatives” (Fournier, 2008, p. 236). Or as Latouche and
Harpages claimed (2010, p. 38), “the suffered degrowth has nothing to do with the chosen

the same message, Ariès (2010) insisted that degrowth is a choice that defenders would make
without the oncoming ecological crisis, “simply to be human”.
We find relevant to quote here Daly as well: “A condition of nongrowth can come about in
two ways: as a failure of a growth economy, or as the success of a steady-state economy. These two
cases are as different as night and day. No one denies that a failure of a growth economy to grow
brings unemployment and suffering. It is precisely to avoid the suffering of a failed growth
economy (we know growth cannot continue) that we advocate SSE” (1992, p. 126). Daly is the
disciple of Georgescu-Roegen and founder of the steady-state economy concept. Most of the
degrowth scholars admit that the transition of degrowth will lead to the stabilization of a stationary
state economy.
Fourth, the complex phenomenon of degrowth has a strong dimension of equity. Growth is
“intrinsically inequitable” (Lavignotte, 2009, p. 71) because it generated in the former four decades
an increase in disparities both internationally and intranationally, creating a mechanism that allowed
rich people to get richer and poor people to be poorer. Abundant official statis tics and papers
portray the co evolution of unprecedented growth and unparalleled disparities and this evidence is
one of the traditional critiques of growth. All degrowth partisans share the view that the transition
entailed by the degrowth process has to allow a redistribution of the global wealth so that a
degrowth society will be an equitable one - built on social justice. For Illich - maybe the most
important precursor of degrowth - equity is the fundamental value of a convivial society (1973, p.
37). Indeed, degrowth of the poor would be a “countersense” as Pallante (2009, p. 49) stressed. The
allowance for Southern countries or societies, where ecological impacts are low relative to their
biocapacity, to increase their material consumption and thus their ecological footprint, is an idea
explicitly favoured by Georgescu- Roegen as well (1975, p. 378).
A fifth characteristic of the degrowth perspective is the quest for a high quality of life that
moves the focus from more to better, addressing the dichotomy of having and being, and
challenging the significant distinction between the qualitative and the quantitative assets in one‟s
life. Therefore, degrowth does not equal a contraction but the enjoyment of life, a notion commonly
attributed to Georgescu-Roegen (1975, p. 18). He describes it as the true product of the economic
process. The paradigmatic proposition of degrowth that human progress without economic growth
is possible (Schneider et al., 2010, p. 512). Latouche (2010, p. 521) refers to it as a decrease of
“well- having” in order to improve “well-being”. The slogan moins des biens, plus des liens (less
goods, more links) (Ariès, 2010; Latouche and Harpages, 2010; Latouche, 2010 etc.) appears

going beyond the humans – things related to the humans – humans relation, in the very same sense
Karl Polanyi indicated in The Great Transformation (2001).

THE

EMERGENCE

OF

LA

DECROISSANCE IN FRANCE

France is deemed on many grounds to be the cradle of the degrowth movement: first, in this
country several milestones took place in the previous decade setting the stage for what promises to
become a new paradigm; second, while the degrowth narrative is increasingly percolating new
territories, the main degrowth ambassadors are mostly French scholars and activists; third, even
though degrowth comes from multiple sources, important precursors of this emergent paradigm are
either French, coming from French speaking countries, or/and writing and publishing in French.
The notion of decroissance does not appear as such in any French dictionary of social
sciences before 2006 (Latouche, 2010a, p. 519, 2010b, p. 14). This indicates that in France as well
the use of the term in the field of economics is of very recent date.
While Lavignotte (2009, p. 11) stated that André Gorz was the first to use the term
decroissance in 1977, The Institute for Social and Economic Studies for Sustainable De growth –
hereafter ISESSD * , shows that the French philosopher André Amar used the term already in 1976
in the magazine Les cahiers de la Nef. The following year (after the presence of Nicholas
Georgescu-Roegen in France) André Gorz advocated already for degrowth in Ecology and Liberty
(1977).
Several reference authors that analyzed the subject of degrowth stated that the term originates
from the French word “decroissance; the same term was used for the translation of a collection of
essays written by the Romanian born economist – Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen (Latouche and
Harpages, 2010, p. 20, Martinez-Alier et al., 2010, p. 1741; Flipo, 2008; Schneider, 2010) – the
intellectual founder of degrowth. The translation of these scientific works by Jacques Grine vald and
Ivo Rens in 1979 into: Demain la Decroissance: Entropie, Ecologie, Economie was to become a
milestone in the degrowth movement.
In 1993, the French ecological magazine Silence, with the headquarters in Lyon, dedicated a
special issue to degrowth and to Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen, edited by Jacques Grinevald. But
during the two decades from 1979 to 1999, the word did not raise but very little attention.

same French city, in 2001, Bruno Clémentin and Vincent Cheynet, founded the magazine Casseurs
de pub, driving inspiration probably from the Canadian periodical Adbusters – the Journal of the
Mental Environment. They imagined the concept of sustainable degrowth (Lavingotte, 2009) and
opposed this concept to sustainable development. As mentioned on the webpage of ISESSD, they
were inspired by the works of Georgescu-Roegen. In 2002, Vincent Cheynet realized a dossier on
degrowth for the magazine Silence. Published initially in 5000 copies, the dossier had two
additionally prints. Next year, together with his colleagues Bruno Clémentin from Casseurs de pub
and Michel Bernard from Silence published the book Objectif décroissance sold in 8000 copies
and republished 3 times.
In 2002 ISESSD was founded and in September 2003 the institute organized the international
colloquium on Sustainable Degrowth in the city hall of Lyon with the participation of about 600
persons. In 2005, following the suggestion of Serge Latouche and the Economic Commission of
Greens a new colloquium on degrowth was organized.
In 2004 degrowth entered the public debate with the first issue of the periodical “La
Decroissance: Le Journal de la Joie de Vivre”. Initially published on a trimestrial basis, it is now
printed monthly in 45 000 to 60 000 copies. The journal is distributed in France, Switzerland,
Luxembourg, Belgium and Canada.
Many other French publications had popularized the years „2000, including large circulation
media. For instance, since 2006 Le Monde has published many articles on degrowth and contributed
to a large extent to the promotion of the movement. As well, several web pages are devoted to
degrowth in France: www.decroissance.net - the online version of the journal La decroissance,
www.decroissance.info – an independent website managed by local groups, www.decroissance.org
– the webpage of ISESSD.
The scientific journal Entropia was launched in 2006 at the French National Assembly by a
group of French academicians, including Serge Latouche, with the aim of

giving theoretical

substance to the idea of degrowth.
Several so called “marches for degrowth” took p lace in various places in France in the recent
years and Degrowth even has its own party in France: the Party for Degrowth (le Parti pour la
Décroissance - PPLD), founded on April 8, 2006 in Dijon. As stated on the webpage * , it calls for a
“degrowth based on equity, sustainability and values that are humanist, democratic, republican,
non-violent, defending human rights and fighting all forms of discrimination and totalitarianism”.

political debates during the presidential election campaigns, when all the candidates were
interpellated on this subject (Latouche, 2007).
In 2008, The First International Conference on Economic Degrowth for Ecological
Sustainability and Social Equity took place in Paris and witnessed the gathering of 140
multidisciplinary scientists. The event was successful: “for the first time, scientists got together in
an interdisciplinary and international academic setting with representatives of the civil society on
the topic of economic degrowth as a possible path for more ecology, more equality and more
wellbeing” (Schneider et al., 2010). The conference proved to be a milestone that developed
academic credibility of the subject of degrowth, idea mainly supported before by civil society
coalitions. Today the fertile ideas behind degrowth are progressively forming an established field of
research.

AN INCREASING AUDIENCE

Nowadays, the degrowth movement is “a rather loose and open network including a variety of
forums for circulating, sharing and debating ideas and experiences” (Fournier, 2008, p. 532). While
originating in France, the movement is increasingly gaining international audience and scope. First
in other Latin countries such as Italy and Spain and in francophone regions (such as the ones in
Belgium, Switzerland and Canada), degrowth is spreading to several other countries in Europe and
across the ocean in both its theoretical and practical dimensions.
Italy appears to be the second cradle of the movement in Europe, where both initiatives for
theoritization and divulgation of degrowth took place almost in parallel with the ones in France,
starting in 2004. La Rete per la decrescita* (Network for Degrowth) was founded by a group o f
activists and intellectuals coming from experiences of solidarity economy, criticism to
development, anti-utilitarism and bioeconomics. Today, the Association for Degrowth has
permanent courses on degrowth issues. In September 2011 they organized as well a summer school
on the subject of degrowth. Moreover, together with the City Hall of Venice, Udine University,
IUAV University, Research and Degrowth Network and other promoters, the association is
responsible for organizing in September 2012 The Third International Conference on Economic
Degrowth for Ecological Sustainability and Social Equity in Venice. One of the central figures on
the degrowth movement in Italy is Maurizio Pallante, who published since 2005 many books on
*

networking the experiences of individuals, associations and comities of people in order to work
together for putting in practice the principles of degrowth.
A Party for Degrowth is active in Italy since July 2007, but degrowth entered the political
debate a year earlier, during the national presidential campaign. Pallante became councilor of the
new Green Minister of the Environment and Paolo Cacciary was elected deputy of Venice after
advocating for degrowth in “Thinking degrowth. Sustainability and Equity”, published in 2006
(Latouche, 2007, p. 18).
In Spain, the Catalonian Network for Degrowth, that today gathers over 1500 members, has
its origins back in 2006. Since that year they organised marches for degrowth, several discussion
sessions, workshops, presentations and other public events for promoting the idea. They even
developed a radio station on degrowth and initiated several projects in various fields such as
permaculture, cooperatives of autoproduction, cohousing. Other eight networks were created in
other regions of Spain. Between March 26th and 29th 2010 the Second International Conference on
Economic Degrowth for Ecological Sustainability and Social Equity was organized. More than 500
scientists, civil society members and practitioners from more than 40 countries joined the event
hosted at the historic building of Universidad de Barcelona.
In Belgium, The Political Movement of Growth Objectors - Le Mouvement politique des
objecteurs de croissance † was founded in 2009 on the 18th October at Brussels. In April 2009, at the
European Parliament building in Brussels, the Club of Rome together with other partners organized
the Workshop on Socially Sustainable Economic Degrowth ‡ .
In Switzerland in November 2008 the first group for promoting degrowth was founded – The
Swiss Network for Growth Objection (Reseau Objection de Croisssance Suisse) that developed first
on the canton of Genève and later on in Vaud and Neuchâtel. New groups were recently created in
Basel § and in Bern** . The platform www.decroissance.ch is an independent initiative promoting all
the activities directly or indirectly linked with degrowth in Switzerland.
In United Kingdom, The New Economic Foundation - NEF organized on January 12th 2010
the conference Rethinking economic growth, Towards an international degrowth network. The term
degrowth became accepted as the English translation for decroissance in 2008, at the international
conference on degrowth from Paris, so only very recently compared with the other countries listed

decroissance in French, numerous initiatives take place already in UK for promoting a transition
towards a future not based on economic growth. The pioneering work of NEF in advancing a new
economy for people and planet and not for profit is representative. NEF published several books
and articles directly linked with the economic degrowth (2010; 2009; 2006). Tim Jackson‟s book,
Prosperity without growth (2009) has gained a considerable atention in the degrowth debate for its
relevance for the transition towards a socio-economic system beyond growth. Transition Towns
Network * in United Kingdom and Ireland that has gradually developed since 2005, is by far one of
the most significant examples of how degrowth can lead to socially and economically sustainable
communities.
Amongst the Scandinavian countries, Finland appears as the initiator of the degrowth debate.
The website www.degrowth.fi represents the online interface of a project that studies degrowth and
takes it into practice in the Finnish context. According to the editors of the webpage, the project,
runned by a couple of researchers that are affiliated with the Aalto University School of Economics
in Helsinki, focuses on the cultural dimensions of degrowth and particularly on the contemporary
practices of citizens, firms, and other organizations that may either encourage or resist the spirit of
growth. In September 24th 2010 the Growth in Transition Conference was organized by The Finnish
Association for Nature Conservation in co-operation with Aalto University School of Economics,
Corporate Environmental and Social Responsibility Research Group and other partners. The
conference brought together over 550 participants including academics, politicians, NGOs,
businesses, the media, and the general public to explore limits to growth as well as possibilities for
ecologically and socially responsible economic models. In addition, more than 400 people watched
the conference on- line on the conference webpage †.
In Eastern Europe, in Hungary, in March 2011 the word degrowth made its way into the
public and academic debates as nemnövekedés, when the degrowth ambassador, Serge Latouche
launched the translation of his book Treaty for Degrowth, in Hungarian (Liegey, 2011).
In Romania, in 2010 the author of this article has contributed together with the French
Cultural Centre of Iasi and the Faculty of Economy and Business Administration from the
“Alexandru Ioan Cuza” University of Iaşi, to the organization of a scientific colloquium on the
aftermaths of the Copenhagen Summit of 2009 that gathered speakers from 7 countries. Following
the suggestion of the author, a session of this colloquium was devoted to degrowth. The session on

the advancement of the growth critiques and the degrowth alternatives locally.
From Europe, across the Atlantic, degrowth movement made its way in 2010 in Canada when
in April 2010 a first conference on Degrowth was organized in Vancouver and following its grand
success, a second one took place in the same city in June 2011 * . Out of a co-operative effort of four
Montreal Universities, a new international conference is scheduled between 14 th and 20th of May
2012 in Montreal †, focusing on the particular situations and dynamics of the Americas related to
degrowth.

CONCLUSIONS

The Romanian economist Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen, considered the intellectual founder of
degrowth, predicted that bioeconomy will be the language that will be spoken by all in the third
millennium. His prophecy seems to become true. Degrowth, on which the economist has insisted as
the only option for a sustainable socio-economic development, has an increasing resonance starting
with the years 2000.
The word decroissance, used for the first time in the‟70 in some French publications for
designating an alternative to the unsustainability of the economic growth, became an activist slogan
in the former decade – in France in 2001, in Italy in 2004 and in Catalunya in 2006, spreading
afterwards in other francophone and Latin regions and countries, including outside Europe. The
English degrowth was accepted at the first international conference on degrowth from 2008;- that
marks as well the extension of the movement in the academic sphere and in the international
debates of civil society.
The contemporary multidimensional crisis (undoubtedly more pronounced on its socio- human
dimension than on the financial and economic ones) offers an opportunity for the advancement of
degrowth: shows the limits of economics, allows the exposure of the growth fetishism as root of the
crisis and generates alternative discourses.
Economic degrowth does not appear as a new doctrine, a programme, an ideology or yet as
another economic theory. Because of the dynamic and complexity of its forms of expression a
comprehensive definition of degrowth is considered to be a difficult task. Nonetheless, from the
reference literature we distinguish some major features of degrowth: it appears as a transition that

ecological impact through reduction of production and consumption. This transition that goes far
beyond decoupling is voluntary and participatory, the degrowth process being a democratic one. As
well degrowth implies equity. Central in the movement is the quest for a high life standard where
the dichotomy quality and quantity is being stressed. Escaping of the economy and the
decolonization of the economic imagery represents the overarching theme of the movement.
The degrowth discourse has echo. As a discourse dominated by the quest for better world
alternatives, it is often interpreted as a new utopia. But it is natural to prefer the utopian discourse in
the place of the dystopian one. Because if we were to refer to the future world where business as
usual types of activities engendered by the imperative of growth will lead finally to a crisis that will
make degrowth inescapable, the scenery will be one of fear and authority and not one in which the
enjoyment of life prevails.
Degrowth is part of a social movement developed on the basis that the economy can degrow
in a democratic and equitable manner. Besides the academic, intellectual and political dimension of
the movement, the civil and the grass roots type of actions form the substantive weight of the
movement. (The various innovative experiences that bring degrowth in practice is the subject of a
subsequent paper with the doctoral research project.)

INTRODUCTION

Starting from the beginning of the previous decade, the new notion of degrowth - for many
years known only by experts in the field - has penetrated the academic, public and political spheres,
rapidly gaining notoriety particularly in Europe.
Only recently being used in economic and social debates, the degrowth perspectives are
founded as a reaction to the unsustainable trend of the current global development, coming from
intellectual sources that cover a relatively old history such as ecology and bioeconomy-and from the
addressing the limits to growth. This has become today both a practical necessity and a moral
imperative. The degrowth promoters add to this drawback a critique that is central in their
discourse: the natural social order. They are denying the contemporary order, insisting on people`s
liberation from the socio-economic imagery generated by the imperative of growth that reduces
people to simple production tools or to consumption units.
Thus degrowth movement implies a synthesis of social objectives (a development that
benefits all, that serves people and it is not served by people, qualitative and not quantitative) and of
ecological concerns (the sustainability of this development).
The paper`s aim is to conceptualize degrowth and to provide an overview of the chronological
landmarks that have brought to the fore the watchword of degrowth. The first section provides an
interpretation of the definitions of degrowth, drawing its main features. Section two and section
three emphasize the development of degrowth movement in France and its increasing audience in
several European countries, focusing on the tools and actors that served for its divulgation. T he
final part provides conclusions summarizing the main points of the paper and suggestions for
further research.

1.

DEFINING DEGROWTH

Key advocates of degrowth state clearly that degrowth it is not a concept per se but “a
political slogan with theoretical implications” (Bayon, Fabrice and Smith, 2011, p. 14; Latouche,
2010a, p. 17, 2010b, p. 519, 2007, p. 20), “a missile word for pulverizing the ideology in which
both the right and the left are swimming”(Ariès, 2010, p. 81; 2007, p. 159; 2005, p. 75), a “political
weapon to decolonize the collective imaginary and free it from the tyranny of growth” (Latouche,
2005a). Thus degrowth is not presented as a doctrine, a program, an ideology or another economic
theory (Martinez Allier et al., 2010, p. 1742; Flipo, 2008, p.26), but as “a symbolic challenge”
(Latouche, 2006b) to policies that herald economic growth as an end in itself. Degrowth is not to be
turned into a blueprint or an end in itself, but to remain a means for fostering a spirit of critique
(Ariès, 2005), for questioning the priority accorded to economic values and principles.
Due to the variety of sources, its complexity and multidimensional forms of expression, it is a
challenge to agree on a clear cut definition for degrowth. Another fellow degrowt h advocate, aware
of the dangers entitled by abstract ideas, Kallis (2010b), stated that degrowth is not meant to be a
complete theory or a new type of „„religion‟‟. In this sense he uttered that “if one is looking for a

fighting against”. Indeed, the lack of clear delimitation allows new forms of expressions of the
degrowth movement to move along the dynamic it entails. But at the same time, while having
positive implications by allowing freedom of interpretation, the lack of a common language for
foregrounding degrowth has negative outcomes such as the fact that it might create confusion. As
we will see below, Kallis (2010, p. 874) gives himself a definition in an attempt of defending
degrowth.
There is not a single referential text about sustainable degrowth that has yet found its way to
the wider academic and political arena, it was the case of the Brundtland Report or the Rio
Declaration for Sustainable Development in 1992 (Martinez Allier et al., 2010, p. 1742).
Commonly, degrowth appears as a potential emergent paradigm that can give a substantial
contribution in reversing the unsustainable path we are in. If this path is to be followed, its
promoters have to be able to describe clearly what degrowth is about.
In the French dictionary Larousse Illustré of 2010 degrowth is defined as policies promoting
a slowdown of the growth rate in a sustainable development perspective (Lavignotte, 2009, p.12).
The editors from The Institute of Economic and Social Studies for a Sustainable Degrowth stress
that this definition is totally flawed as its advocates (Ariès, 2010, 2008; Latouche, 2011a, 2011b,
2010) make clear that degrowth is not “negative growth” – but “an absurd and oxymoronical
expression that translates to a large extent the domination of the growth imagery” Latouche (2007,
p.21). Moreover the literature on degrowth issues provides an important body of virulent critiques
to sustainable development (Latouche, 2011b, 2010a, 2006, p. 30, 2004b, p. 51; Bayon et al., 2010,
pp.81-102; Bonaiuti, 2010, p. 2; Ariès, 2010, p. 258, 2009, p. 13; Pallante, 2009, p. 20; Fournier,
2008, p. 539; Wallenborn, 2008, pp. 228-229;)
Thus, according to IESSSD “degrowth reflects policies for promoting degrowth of the rich
countries, mostly, and aiming at escaping the economism (invasion of all the human and social
dimensions by the economy) (…) Sustainable degrowth is opposing the supporters of sustainable
development who believe that economic growth can be conjugated with the environmental
protection” (Lavignotte, 2009, p. 12).
One of the first attempts to give a comprehensive definition of degrowth comes from the
Conference on Economic De-growth for Ecological Sustainability and Social Equity held in Paris
(2008). Several academicians that approached the subject provided definitions based on their
consideration on degrowth. The table below presents a selection of definitions of degrowth from the

by authors from France, Spain and Italy.
Table 1 – Selected Definitions of Degrowth
Definiti ons of degrowth
“a voluntary transition towards a just, participatory, and ecologically sustainable society.
The objectives of degrowth are to meet basic human needs and ensure a high quality of
life, while reducing the ecological impact of the global economy to a sustain able level,
equitably distributed between nations”.
“(A society of degrowth) should be understood as a society built on quality rather than on
quantity, on cooperation rather than on competition […] hu manity liberated from
economis m for wh ich social justice is the objective”.
„Sustainable degrowth is both a banner associated with social and environmental
movements and an emergent concept in academic and intellectual circles, they are
interdependent and affect each other”.
“Sustainable degrowth can be defined from an ecological–economic perspective as a
socially sustainable and equitable reduction (and eventually stabilization) of society's
throughput”.
“Degrowth proposes the promotion of the most ample substitution possible of the goods
industrially produced and purchased in the commercial route with the autoproduction of
goods. In this choice, that implies a decrease of the GDP, we identify the possibil ity of an
extraordinary imp rovement of the individual and collective life, of the environmental
conditions and of the relations between peoples, states and culture”.
“Sustainable degrowth may be defined as an equitable downscaling of production and
consumption that increases human wellbeing and enhances ecological conditions at the
local and global level, in the short and long term”.

We distinguish from these definitions the key features that describe de notion of degrowth:
First, degrowth appears as a transition that requires a transformation of the global economic
system. As important advocates of degrowth clearly explain (Latouche, 2010, p. 521), the
movement does not advocate for degrowth for the sake of degrowth, an approach that would
describe the same symmetry of the imperative for chrematistic growth and would be absurd, but
degrowth is a process that aims at reversing the unsustainable path of our development. This feature
of escaping from the economy is seen by many authors as a critical one. Latouche (2010, p. 519,
2008; 2007, p. 22) states that it would be best to speak about “agrowth” instead of degrowth, as one
speaks as atheism: “It actually means quite precisely, the abandonment of a religion: the religion of
the economy, growth, progress and development”. In this sense, as Valerie Fournier clearly
emphasized as well (2008, p. 528), the degrowth movement‟s over-arching theme is escaping from
the economy as system of representation. In accordance with a humanist approach - this Cultural
Revolution is indispensable in order to achieve a life style change that is not only accepted and
unconstrained, but translated into development of the “enjoyment of life” (Lavignotte, 2009, p. 13).

important dimension of degrowth. But more than a decrease of consumption and production what is
also needed is the decolonization of the so called economic imagery. The “logic of economy”
requires a new approach, the myth of “limitless growth” needs to be abandoned because after
colonizing all territories of material goods and most part of the territories of services, “the
commodification has sent its vanguard on the mental territories” (Pallante, 2009, p. 12). Therefore
there is a need of an ecology of mind for decolonization of the mental environment.
Second, the obvious objective of degrowth is the reduction of the ecological impact through
the downscaling of production and consumption. Degrowth goes beyond decoupling material and
energy use from growth (dematerialization or green growth), postulating that efficiency
improvements alone are not sufficient and might be counterproductive (Schneider, 2010, p. 512)
because it would consist in a reduction of environmental impact through more efficient or cleaner
technologies, while keeping production and consumption growing, as indicated by the Jevons
Paradox (Polimeni et al., 2008; Polimeni & Polimeni, 2006). In this sense, degrowth advocates are
very firm concerning the distinction between sustainable development and sustainable degrowth
(Ariès, 2010, p. 13; Bonaiuti, 2010; Fournier, 2008, p. 539; Latouche, 2004b, p. 51; Levallois,
2010; Pallante, 2009, p. 20).
A third feature is that this transition is voluntary and participatory, therefore the process of
degrowth is democratic. It is widely accepted within the reference literature, that a definition of
degrowth based only on the reduction of metabolism in terms of material and energy flows
translates in a limited understanding of degrowth. For the degrowth scholars degrowth appears as
the result of a collective choice for a better living, not an imperative imposed by an external
authority. Therefore, degrowth is not defended as a necessity but as a choice, one that has to be
made democratically and openly (Latouche and Harpages, 2010, p. 38; Fournier, 2008; Flipo, 2008;
Schneider, 2010b; Latouche, 2010; Ariès, 2010; Mylondo, 2008, p. 175). Valerie Fournier clearly
emphasized this feature in a widely cited article: “Degrowth is offered as a way of avoiding
„„ecocracy‟‟ in the future, a path we could chose today to remain in a position to collectively and
democratically shape our future in the face of ecological degradation. The more we wait, the more
the shock imposed by the earth natural limits might be brutal and the risk of emerging
„„ecototalitarian‟‟ responses high. But whilst recognizing the threat of environmental degradation,
proponents of degrowth are not prepared to sacrifice democracy to some ecological imperative any
more than to economic or political imperatives” (Fournier, 2008, p. 236). Or as Latouche and
Harpages claimed (2010, p. 38), “the suffered degrowth has nothing to do with the chosen

the same message, Ariès (2010) insisted that degrowth is a choice that defenders would make
without the oncoming ecological crisis, “simply to be human”.
We find relevant to quote here Daly as well: “A condition of nongrowth can come about in
two ways: as a failure of a growth economy, or as the success of a steady-state economy. These two
cases are as different as night and day. No one denies that a failure of a growth economy to grow
brings unemployment and suffering. It is precisely to avoid the suffering of a failed growth
economy (we know growth cannot continue) that we advocate SSE” (1992, p. 126). Daly is the
disciple of Georgescu-Roegen and founder of the steady-state economy concept. Most of the
degrowth scholars admit that the transition of degrowth will lead to the stabilization of a stationary
state economy.
Fourth, the complex phenomenon of degrowth has a strong dimension of equity. Growth is
“intrinsically inequitable” (Lavignotte, 2009, p. 71) because it generated in the former four decades
an increase in disparities both internationally and intranationally, creating a mechanism that allowed
rich people to get richer and poor people to be poorer. Abundant official statis tics and papers
portray the co evolution of unprecedented growth and unparalleled disparities and this evidence is
one of the traditional critiques of growth. All degrowth partisans share the view that the transition
entailed by the degrowth process has to allow a redistribution of the global wealth so that a
degrowth society will be an equitable one - built on social justice. For Illich - maybe the most
important precursor of degrowth - equity is the fundamental value of a convivial society (1973, p.
37). Indeed, degrowth of the poor would be a “countersense” as Pallante (2009, p. 49) stressed. The
allowance for Southern countries or societies, where ecological impacts are low relative to their
biocapacity, to increase their material consumption and thus their ecological footprint, is an idea
explicitly favoured by Georgescu- Roegen as well (1975, p. 378).
A fifth characteristic of the degrowth perspective is the quest for a high quality of life that
moves the focus from more to better, addressing the dichotomy of having and being, and
challenging the significant distinction between the qualitative and the quantitative assets in one‟s
life. Therefore, degrowth does not equal a contraction but the enjoyment of life, a notion commonly
attributed to Georgescu-Roegen (1975, p. 18). He describes it as the true product of the economic
process. The paradigmatic proposition of degrowth that human progress without economic growth
is possible (Schneider et al., 2010, p. 512). Latouche (2010, p. 521) refers to it as a decrease of
“well- having” in order to improve “well-being”. The slogan moins des biens, plus des liens (less
goods, more links) (Ariès, 2010; Latouche and Harpages, 2010; Latouche, 2010 etc.) appears

going beyond the humans – things related to the humans – humans relation, in the very same sense
Karl Polanyi indicated in The Great Transformation (2001).

CHRONOLOGICAL

LANDMARKS

OF

THE

EMERGENCE

OF

LA

DECROISSANCE IN FRANCE

France is deemed on many grounds to be the cradle of the degrowth movement: first, in this
country several milestones took place in the previous decade setting the stage for what promises to
become a new paradigm; second, while the degrowth narrative is increasingly percolating new
territories, the main degrowth ambassadors are mostly French scholars and activists; third, even
though degrowth comes from multiple sources, important precursors of this emergent paradigm are
either French, coming from French speaking countries, or/and writing and publishing in French.
The notion of decroissance does not appear as such in any French dictionary of social
sciences before 2006 (Latouche, 2010a, p. 519, 2010b, p. 14). This indicates that in France as well
the use of the term in the field of economics is of very recent date.
While Lavignotte (2009, p. 11) stated that André Gorz was the first to use the term
decroissance in 1977, The Institute for Social and Economic Studies for Sustainable De growth –
hereafter ISESSD * , shows that the French philosopher André Amar used the term already in 1976
in the magazine Les cahiers de la Nef. The following year (after the presence of Nicholas
Georgescu-Roegen in France) André Gorz advocated already for degrowth in Ecology and Liberty
(1977).
Several reference authors that analyzed the subject of degrowth stated that the term originates
from the French word “decroissance; the same term was used for the translation of a collection of
essays written by the Romanian born economist – Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen (Latouche and
Harpages, 2010, p. 20, Martinez-Alier et al., 2010, p. 1741; Flipo, 2008; Schneider, 2010) – the
intellectual founder of degrowth. The translation of these scientific works by Jacques Grine vald and
Ivo Rens in 1979 into: Demain la Decroissance: Entropie, Ecologie, Economie was to become a
milestone in the degrowth movement.
In 1993, the French ecological magazine Silence, with the headquarters in Lyon, dedicated a
special issue to degrowth and to Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen, edited by Jacques Grinevald. But
during the two decades from 1979 to 1999, the word did not raise but very little attention.

same French city, in 2001, Bruno Clémentin and Vincent Cheynet, founded the magazine Casseurs
de pub, driving inspiration probably from the Canadian periodical Adbusters – the Journal of the
Mental Environment. They imagined the concept of sustainable degrowth (Lavingotte, 2009) and
opposed this concept to sustainable development. As mentioned on the webpage of ISESSD, they
were inspired by the works of Georgescu-Roegen. In 2002, Vincent Cheynet realized a dossier on
degrowth for the magazine Silence. Published initially in 5000 copies, the dossier had two
additionally prints. Next year, together with his colleagues Bruno Clémentin from Casseurs de pub
and Michel Bernard from Silence published the book Objectif décroissance sold in 8000 copies
and republished 3 times.
In 2002 ISESSD was founded and in September 2003 the institute organized the international
colloquium on Sustainable Degrowth in the city hall of Lyon with the participation of about 600
persons. In 2005, following the suggestion of Serge Latouche and the Economic Commission of
Greens a new colloquium on degrowth was organized.
In 2004 degrowth entered the public debate with the first issue of the periodical “La
Decroissance: Le Journal de la Joie de Vivre”. Initially published on a trimestrial basis, it is now
printed monthly in 45 000 to 60 000 copies. The journal is distributed in France, Switzerland,
Luxembourg, Belgium and Canada.
Many other French publications had popularized the years „2000, including large circulation
media. For instance, since 2006 Le Monde has published many articles on degrowth and contributed
to a large extent to the promotion of the movement. As well, several web pages are devoted to
degrowth in France: www.decroissance.net - the online version of the journal La decroissance,
www.decroissance.info – an independent website managed by local groups, www.decroissance.org
– the webpage of ISESSD.
The scientific journal Entropia was launched in 2006 at the French National Assembly by a
group of French academicians, including Serge Latouche, with the aim of

giving theoretical

substance to the idea of degrowth.
Several so called “marches for degrowth” took p lace in various places in France in the recent
years and Degrowth even has its own party in France: the Party for Degrowth (le Parti pour la
Décroissance - PPLD), founded on April 8, 2006 in Dijon. As stated on the webpage * , it calls for a
“degrowth based on equity, sustainability and values that are humanist, democratic, republican,
non-violent, defending human rights and fighting all forms of discrimination and totalitarianism”.

political debates during the presidential election campaigns, when all the candidates were
interpellated on this subject (Latouche, 2007).
In 2008, The First International Conference on Economic Degrowth for Ecological
Sustainability and Social Equity took place in Paris and witnessed the gathering of 140
multidisciplinary scientists. The event was successful: “for the first time, scientists got together in
an interdisciplinary and international academic setting with representatives of the civil society on
the topic of economic degrowth as a possible path for more ecology, more equality and more
wellbeing” (Schneider et al., 2010). The conference proved to be a milestone that developed
academic credibility of the subject of degrowth, idea mainly supported before by civil society
coalitions. Today the fertile ideas behind degrowth are progressively forming an established field of
research.

3.

AN INCREASING AUDIENCE

Nowadays, the degrowth movement is “a rather loose and open network including a variety of
forums for circulating, sharing and debating ideas and experiences” (Fournier, 2008, p. 532). While
originating in France, the movement is increasingly gaining international audience and scope. First
in other Latin countries such as Italy and Spain and in francophone regions (such as the ones in
Belgium, Switzerland and Canada), degrowth is spreading to several other countries in Europe and
across the ocean in both its theoretical and practical dimensions.
Italy appears to be the second cradle of the movement in Europe, where both initiatives for
theoritization and divulgation of degrowth took place almost in parallel with the ones in France,
starting in 2004. La Rete per la decrescita* (Network for Degrowth) was founded by a group o f
activists and intellectuals coming from experiences of solidarity economy, criticism to
development, anti-utilitarism and bioeconomics. Today, the Association for Degrowth has
permanent courses on degrowth issues. In September 2011 they organized as well a summer school
on the subject of degrowth. Moreover, together with the City Hall of Venice, Udine University,
IUAV University, Research and Degrowth Network and other promoters, the association is
responsible for organizing in September 2012 The Third International Conference on Economic
Degrowth for Ecological Sustainability and Social Equity in Venice. One of the central figures on
the degrowth movement in Italy is Maurizio Pallante, who published since 2005 many books on

networking the experiences of individuals, associations and comities of people in order to work
together for putting in practice the principles of degrowth.
A Party for Degrowth is active in Italy since July 2007, but degrowth entered the political
debate a year earlier, during the national presidential campaign. Pallante became councilor of the
new Green Minister of the Environment and Paolo Cacciary was elected deputy of Venice after
advocating for degrowth in “Thinking degrowth. Sustainability and Equity”, published in 2006
(Latouche, 2007, p. 18).
In Spain, the Catalonian Network for Degrowth, that today gathers over 1500 members, has
its origins back in 2006. Since that year they organised marches for degrowth, several discussion
sessions, workshops, presentations and other public events for promoting the idea. They even
developed a radio station on degrowth and initiated several projects in various fields such as
permaculture, cooperatives of autoproduction, cohousing. Other eight networks were created in
other regions of Spain. Between March 26th and 29th 2010 the Second International Conference on
Economic Degrowth for Ecological Sustainability and Social Equity was organized. More than 500
scientists, civil society members and practitioners from more than 40 countries joined the event
hosted at the historic building of Universidad de Barcelona.
In Belgium, The Political Movement of Growth Objectors - Le Mouvement politique des
objecteurs de croissance † was founded in 2009 on the 18th October at Brussels. In April 2009, at the
European Parliament building in Brussels, the Club of Rome together with other partners organized
the Workshop on Socially Sustainable Economic Degrowth ‡ .
In Switzerland in November 2008 the first group for promoting degrowth was founded – The
Swiss Network for Growth Objection (Reseau Objection de Croisssance Suisse) that developed first
on the canton of Genève and later on in Vaud and Neuchâtel. New groups were recently created in
Basel § and in Bern** . The platform www.decroissance.ch is an independent initiative promoting all
the activities directly or indirectly linked with degrowth in Switzerland.
In United Kingdom, The New Economic Foundation - NEF organized on January 12th 2010
the conference Rethinking economic growth, Towards an international degrowth network. The term
degrowth became accepted as the English translation for decroissance in 2008, at the international
conference on degrowth from Paris, so only very recently compared with the other countries listed

decroissance in French, numerous initiatives take place already in UK for promoting a transition
towards a future not based on economic growth. The pioneering work of NEF in advancing a new
economy for people and planet and not for profit is representative. NEF published several books
and articles directly linked with the economic degrowth (2010; 2009; 2006). Tim Jackson‟s book,
Prosperity without growth (2009) has gained a considerable atention in the degrowth debate for its
relevance for the transition towards a socio-economic system beyond growth. Transition Towns
Network * in United Kingdom and Ireland that has gradually developed since 2005, is by far one of
the most significant examples of how degrowth can lead to socially and economically sustainable
communities.
Amongst the Scandinavian countries, Finland appears as the initiator of the degrowth debate.
The website www.degrowth.fi represents the online interface of a project that studies degrowth and
takes it into practice in the Finnish context. According to the editors of the webpage, the project,
runned by a couple of researchers that are affiliated with the Aalto University School of Economics
in Helsinki, focuses on the cultural dimensions of degrowth and particularly on the contemporary
practices of citizens, firms, and other organizations that may either encourage or resist the spirit of
growth. In September 24th 2010 the Growth in Transition Conference was organized by The Finnish
Association for Nature Conservation in co-operation with Aalto University School of Economics,
Corporate Environmental and Social Responsibility Research Group and other partners. The
conference brought together over 550 participants including academics, politicians, NGOs,
businesses, the media, and the general public to explore limits to growth as well as possibilities for
ecologically and socially responsible economic models. In addition, more than 400 people watched
the conference on- line on the conference webpage †.
In Eastern Europe, in Hungary, in March 2011 the word degrowth made its way into the
public and academic debates as nemnövekedés, when the degrowth ambassador, Serge Latouche
launched the translation of his book Treaty for Degrowth, in Hungarian (Liegey, 2011).
In Romania, in 2010 the author of this article has contributed together with the French
Cultural Centre of Iasi and the Faculty of Economy and Business Administration from the
“Alexandru Ioan Cuza” University of Iaşi, to the organization of a scientific colloquium on the
aftermaths of the Copenhagen Summit of 2009 that gathered speakers from 7 countries. Following
the suggestion of the author, a session of this colloquium was devoted to degrowth. The session on

the advancement of the growth critiques and the degrowth alternatives locally.
From Europe, across the Atlantic, degrowth movement made its way in 2010 in Canada when
in April 2010 a first conference on Degrowth was organized in Vancouver and following its grand
success, a second one took place in the same city in June 2011 * . Out of a co-operative effort of four
Montreal Universities, a new international conference is scheduled between 14 th and 20th of May
2012 in Montreal †, focusing on the particular situations and dynamics of the Americas related to
degrowth.

CONCLUSIONS

The Romanian economist Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen, considered the intellectual founder of
degrowth, predicted that bioeconomy will be the language that will be spoken by all in the third
millennium. His prophecy seems to become true. Degrowth, on which the economist has insisted as
the only option for a sustainable socio-economic development, has an increasing resonance starting
with the years 2000.
The word decroissance, used for the first time in the‟70 in some French publications for
designating an alternative to the unsustainability of the economic growth, became an activist slogan
in the former decade – in France in 2001, in Italy in 2004 and in Catalunya in 2006, spreading
afterwards in other francophone and Latin regions and countries, including outside Europe. The
English degrowth was accepted at the first international conference on degrowth from 2008;- that
marks as well the extension of the movement in the academic sphere and in the international
debates of civil society.
The contemporary multidimensional crisis (undoubtedly more pronounced on its socio- human
dimension than on the financial and economic ones) offers an opportunity for the advancement of
degrowth: shows the limits of economics, allows the exposure of the growth fetishism as root of the
crisis and generates alternative discourses.
Economic degrowth does not appear as a new doctrine, a programme, an ideology or yet as
another economic theory. Because of the dynamic and complexity of its forms of expression a
comprehensive definition of degrowth is considered to be a difficult task. Nonetheless, from the
reference literature we distinguish some major features of degrowth: it appears as a transition that

ecological impact through reduction of production and consumption. This transition that goes far
beyond decoupling is voluntary and participatory, the degrowth process being a democratic one. As
well degrowth implies equity. Central in the movement is the quest for a high life standard where
the dichotomy quality and quantity is being stressed. Escaping of the economy and the
decolonization of the economic imagery represents the overarching theme of the movement.
The degrowth discourse has echo. As a discourse dominated by the quest for better world
alternatives, it is often interpreted as a new utopia. But it is natural to prefer the utopian discourse in
the place of the dystopian one. Because if we were to refer to the future world where business as
usual types of activities engendered by the imperative of growth will lead finally to a crisis that will
make degrowth inescapable, the scenery will be one of fear and authority and not one in which the
enjoyment of life prevails.
Degrowth is part of a social movement developed on the basis that the economy can degrow
in a democratic and equitable manner. Besides the academic, intellectual and political dimension of
the movement, the civil and the grass roots type of actions form the substantive weight of the
movement. (The various innovative experiences that bring degrowth in practice is the subject of a
subsequent paper with the doctoral research project.)

INTRODUCTION

Starting from the beginning of the previous decade, the new notion of degrowth - for many
years known only by experts in the field - has penetrated the academic, public and political spheres,
rapidly gaining notoriety particularly in Europe.
Only recently being used in economic and social debates, the degrowth perspectives are
founded as a reaction to the unsustainable trend of the current global development, coming from
intellectual sources that cover a relatively old history such as ecology and bioeconomy-and from the
addressing the limits to growth. This has become today both a practical necessity and a moral
imperative. The degrowth promoters add to this drawback a critique that is central in their
discourse: the natural social order. They are denying the contemporary order, insisting on people`s
liberation from the socio-economic imagery generated by the imperative of growth that reduces
people to simple production tools or to consumption units.
Thus degrowth movement implies a synthesis of social objectives (a development that
benefits all, that serves people and it is not served by people, qualitative and not quantitative) and of
ecological concerns (the sustainability of this development).
The paper`s aim is to conceptualize degrowth and to provide an overview of the chronological
landmarks that have brought to the fore the watchword of degrowth. The first section provides an
interpretation of the definitions of degrowth, drawing its main features. Section two and section
three emphasize the development of degrowth movement in France and its increasing audience in
several European countries, focusing on the tools and actors that served for its divulgation. T he
final part provides conclusions summarizing the main points of the paper and suggestions for
further research.

1.

DEFINING DEGROWTH

Key advocates of degrowth state clearly that degrowth it is not a concept per se but “a
political slogan with theoretical implications” (Bayon, Fabrice and Smith, 2011, p. 14; Latouche,
2010a, p. 17, 2010b, p. 519, 2007, p. 20), “a missile word for pulverizing the ideology in which
both the right and the left are swimming”(Ariès, 2010, p. 81; 2007, p. 159; 2005, p. 75), a “political
weapon to decolonize the collective imaginary and free it from the tyranny of growth” (Latouche,
2005a). Thus degrowth is not presented as a doctrine, a program, an ideology or another economic
theory (Martinez Allier et al., 2010, p. 1742; Flipo, 2008, p.26), but as “a symbolic challenge”
(Latouche, 2006b) to policies that herald economic growth as an end in itself. Degrowth is not to be
turned into a blueprint or an end in itself, but to remain a means for fostering a spirit of critique
(Ariès, 2005), for questioning the priority accorded to economic values and principles.
Due to the variety of sources, its complexity and multidimensional forms of expression, it is a
challenge to agree on a clear cut definition for degrowth. Another fellow degrowt h advocate, aware
of the dangers entitled by abstract ideas, Kallis (2010b), stated that degrowth is not meant to be a
complete theory or a new type of „„religion‟‟. In this sense he uttered that “if one is looking for a

fighting against”. Indeed, the lack of clear delimitation allows new forms of expressions of the
degrowth movement to move along the dynamic it entails. But at the same time, while having
positive implications by allowing freedom of interpretation, the lack of a common language for
foregrounding degrowth has negative outcomes such as the fact that it might create confusion. As
we will see below, Kallis (2010, p. 874) gives himself a definition in an attempt of defending
degrowth.
There is not a single referential text about sustainable degrowth that has yet found its way to
the wider academic and political arena, it was the case of the Brundtland Report or the Rio
Declaration for Sustainable Development in 1992 (Martinez Allier et al., 2010, p. 1742).
Commonly, degrowth appears as a potential emergent paradigm that can give a substantial
contribution in reversing the unsustainable path we are in. If this path is to be followed, its
promoters have to be able to describe clearly what degrowth is about.
In the French dictionary Larousse Illustré of 2010 degrowth is defined as policies promoting
a slowdown of the growth rate in a sustainable development perspective (Lavignotte, 2009, p.12).
The editors from The Institute of Economic and Social Studies for a Sustainable Degrowth stress
that this definition is totally flawed as its advocates (Ariès, 2010, 2008; Latouche, 2011a, 2011b,
2010) make clear that degrowth is not “negative growth” – but “an absurd and oxymoronical
expression that translates to a large extent the domination of the growth imagery” Latouche (2007,
p.21). Moreover the literature on degrowth issues provides an important body of virulent critiques
to sustainable development (Latouche, 2011b, 2010a, 2006, p. 30, 2004b, p. 51; Bayon et al., 2010,
pp.81-102; Bonaiuti, 2010, p. 2; Ariès, 2010, p. 258, 2009, p. 13; Pallante, 2009, p. 20; Fournier,
2008, p. 539; Wallenborn, 2008, pp. 228-229;)
Thus, according to IESSSD “degrowth reflects policies for promoting degrowth of the rich
countries, mostly, and aiming at escaping the economism (invasion of all the human and social
dimensions by the economy) (…) Sustainable degrowth is opposing the supporters of sustainable
development who believe that economic growth can be conjugated with the environmental
protection” (Lavignotte, 2009, p. 12).
One of the first attempts to give a comprehensive definition of degrowth comes from the
Conference on Economic De-growth for Ecological Sustainability and Social Equity held in Paris
(2008). Several academicians that approached the subject provided definitions based on their
consideration on degrowth. The table below presents a selection of definitions of degrowth from the

by authors from France, Spain and Italy.
Table 1 – Selected Definitions of Degrowth
Definiti ons of degrowth
“a voluntary transition towards a just, participatory, and ecologically sustainable society.
The objectives of degrowth are to meet basic human needs and ensure a high quality of
life, while reducing the ecological impact of the global economy to a sustain able level,
equitably distributed between nations”.
“(A society of degrowth) should be understood as a society built on quality rather than on
quantity, on cooperation rather than on competition […] hu manity liberated from
economis m for wh ich social justice is the objective”.
„Sustainable degrowth is both a banner associated with social and environmental
movements and an emergent concept in academic and intellectual circles, they are
interdependent and affect each other”.
“Sustainable degrowth can be defined from an ecological–economic perspective as a
socially sustainable and equitable reduction (and eventually stabilization) of society's
throughput”.
“Degrowth proposes the promotion of the most ample substitution possible of the goods
industrially produced and purchased in the commercial route with the autoproduction of
goods. In this choice, that implies a decrease of the GDP, we identify the possibil ity of an
extraordinary imp rovement of the individual and collective life, of the environmental
conditions and of the relations between peoples, states and culture”.
“Sustainable degrowth may be defined as an equitable downscaling of production and
consumption that increases human wellbeing and enhances ecological conditions at the
local and global level, in the short and long term”.

We distinguish from these definitions the key features that describe de notion of degrowth:
First, degrowth appears as a transition that requires a transformation of the global economic
system. As important advocates of degrowth clearly explain (Latouche, 2010, p. 521), the
movement does not advocate for degrowth for the sake of degrowth, an approach that would
describe the same symmetry of the imperative for chrematistic growth and would be absurd, but
degrowth is a process that aims at reversing the unsustainable path of our development. This feature
of escaping from the economy is seen by many authors as a critical one. Latouche (2010, p. 519,
2008; 2007, p. 22) states that it would be best to speak about “agrowth” instead of degrowth, as one
speaks as atheism: “It actually means quite precisely, the abandonment of a religion: the religion of
the economy, growth, progress and development”. In this sense, as Valerie Fournier clearly
emphasized as well (2008, p. 528), the degrowth movement‟s over-arching theme is escaping from
the economy as system of representation. In accordance with a humanist approach - this Cultural
Revolution is indispensable in order to achieve a life style change that is not only accepted and
unconstrained, but translated into development of the “enjoyment of life” (Lavignotte, 2009, p. 13).

important dimension of degrowth. But more than a decrease of consumption and production what is
also needed is the decolonization of the so called economic imagery. The “logic of economy”
requires a new approach, the myth of “limitless growth” needs to be abandoned because after
colonizing all territories of material goods and most part of the territories of services, “the
commodification has sent its vanguard on the mental territories” (Pallante, 2009, p. 12). Therefore
there is a need of an ecology of mind for decolonization of the mental environment.
Second, the obvious objective of degrowth is the reduction of the ecological impact through
the downscaling of production and consumption. Degrowth goes beyond decoupling material and
energy use from growth (dematerialization or green growth), postulating that efficiency
improvements alone are not sufficient and might be counterproductive (Schneider, 2010, p. 512)
because it would consist in a reduction of environmental impact through more efficient or cleaner
technologies, while keeping production and consumption growing, as indicated by the Jevons
Paradox (Polimeni et al., 2008; Polimeni & Polimeni, 2006). In this sense, degrowth advocates are
very firm concerning the distinction between sustainable development and sustainable degrowth
(Ariès, 2010, p. 13; Bonaiuti, 2010; Fournier, 2008, p. 539; Latouche, 2004b, p. 51; Levallois,
2010; Pallante, 2009, p. 20).
A third feature is that this transition is voluntary and participatory, therefore the process of
degrowth is democratic. It is widely accepted within the reference literature, that a definition of
degrowth based only on the reduction of metabolism in terms of material and energy flows
translates in a limited understanding of degrowth. For the degrowth scholars degrowth appears as
the result of a collective choice for a better living, not an imperative imposed by an external
authority. Therefore, degrowth is not defended as a necessity but as a choice, one that has to be
made democratically and openly (Latouche and Harpages, 2010, p. 38; Fournier, 2008; Flipo, 2008;
Schneider, 2010b; Latouche, 2010; Ariès, 2010; Mylondo, 2008, p. 175). Valerie Fournier clearly
emphasized this feature in a widely cited article: “Degrowth is offered as a way of avoiding
„„ecocracy‟‟ in the future, a path we could chose today to remain in a position to collectively and
democratically shape our future in the face of ecological degradation. The more we wait, the more
the shock imposed by the earth natural limits might be brutal and the risk of emerging
„„ecototalitarian‟‟ responses high. But whilst recognizing the threat of environmental degradation,
proponents of degrowth are not prepared to sacrifice democracy to some ecological imperative any
more than to economic or political imperatives” (Fournier, 2008, p. 236). Or as Latouche and
Harpages claimed (2010, p. 38), “the suffered degrowth has nothing to do with the chosen

the same message, Ariès (2010) insisted that degrowth is a choice that defenders would make
without the oncoming ecological crisis, “simply to be human”.
We find relevant to quote here Daly as well: “A condition of nongrowth can come about in
two ways: as a failure of a growth economy, or as the success of a steady-state economy. These two
cases are as different as night and day. No one denies that a failure of a growth economy to grow
brings unemployment and suffering. It is precisely to avoid the suffering of a failed growth
economy (we know growth cannot continue) that we advocate SSE” (1992, p. 126). Daly is the
disciple of Georgescu-Roegen and founder of the steady-state economy concept. Most of the
degrowth scholars admit that the transition of degrowth will lead to the stabilization of a stationary
state economy.
Fourth, the complex phenomenon of degrowth has a strong dimension of equity. Growth is
“intrinsically inequitable” (Lavignotte, 2009, p. 71) because it generated in the former four decades
an increase in disparities both internationally and intranationally, creating a mechanism that allowed
rich people to get richer and poor people to be poorer. Abundant official statis tics and papers
portray the co evolution of unprecedented growth and unparalleled disparities and this evidence is
one of the traditional critiques of growth. All degrowth partisans share the view that the transition
entailed by the degrowth process has to allow a redistribution of the global wealth so that a
degrowth society will be an equitable one - built on social justice. For Illich - maybe the most
important precursor of degrowth - equity is the fundamental value of a convivial society (1973, p.
37). Indeed, degrowth of the poor would be a “countersense” as Pallante (2009, p. 49) stressed. The
allowance for Southern countries or societies, where ecological impacts are low relative to their
biocapacity, to increase their material consumption and thus their ecological footprint, is an idea
explicitly favoured by Georgescu- Roegen as well (1975, p. 378).
A fifth characteristic of the degrowth perspective is the quest for a high quality of life that
moves the focus from more to better, addressing the dichotomy of having and being, and
challenging the significant distinction between the qualitative and the quantitative assets in one‟s
life. Therefore, degrowth does not equal a contraction but the enjoyment of life, a notion commonly
attributed to Georgescu-Roegen (1975, p. 18). He describes it as the true product of the economic
process. The paradigmatic proposition of degrowth that human progress without economic growth
is possible (Schneider et al., 2010, p. 512). Latouche (2010, p. 521) refers to it as a decrease of
“well- having” in order to improve “well-being”. The slogan moins des biens, plus des liens (less
goods, more links) (Ariès, 2010; Latouche and Harpages, 2010; Latouche, 2010 etc.) appears

going beyond the humans – things related to the humans – humans relation, in the very same sense
Karl Polanyi indicated in The Great Transformation (2001).

CHRONOLOGICAL

LANDMARKS

OF

THE

EMERGENCE

OF

LA

DECROISSANCE IN FRANCE

France is deemed on many grounds to be the cradle of the degrowth movement: first, in this
country several milestones took place in the previous decade setting the stage for what promises to
become a new paradigm; second, while the degrowth narrative is increasingly percolating new
territories, the main degrowth ambassadors are mostly French scholars and activists; third, even
though degrowth comes from multiple sources, important precursors of this emergent paradigm are
either French, coming from French speaking countries, or/and writing and publishing in French.
The notion of decroissance does not appear as such in any French dictionary of social
sciences before 2006 (Latouche, 2010a, p. 519, 2010b, p. 14). This indicates that in France as well
the use of the term in the field of economics is of very recent date.
While Lavignotte (2009, p. 11) stated that André Gorz was the first to use the term
decroissance in 1977, The Institute for Social and Economic Studies for Sustainable De growth –
hereafter ISESSD * , shows that the French philosopher André Amar used the term already in 1976
in the magazine Les cahiers de la Nef. The following year (after the presence of Nicholas
Georgescu-Roegen in France) André Gorz advocated already for degrowth in Ecology and Liberty
(1977).
Several reference authors that analyzed the subject of degrowth stated that the term originates
from the French word “decroissance; the same term was used for the translation of a collection of
essays written by the Romanian born economist – Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen (Latouche and
Harpages, 2010, p. 20, Martinez-Alier et al., 2010, p. 1741; Flipo, 2008; Schneider, 2010) – the
intellectual founder of degrowth. The translation of these scientific works by Jacques Grine vald and
Ivo Rens in 1979 into: Demain la Decroissance: Entropie, Ecologie, Economie was to become a
milestone in the degrowth movement.
In 1993, the French ecological magazine Silence, with the headquarters in Lyon, dedicated a
special issue to degrowth and to Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen, edited by Jacques Grinevald. But
during the two decades from 1979 to 1999, the word did not raise but very little attention.

same French city, in 2001, Bruno Clémentin and Vincent Cheynet, founded the magazine Casseurs
de pub, driving inspiration probably from the Canadian periodical Adbusters – the Journal of the
Mental Environment. They imagined the concept of sustainable degrowth (Lavingotte, 2009) and
opposed this concept to sustainable development. As mentioned on the webpage of ISESSD, they
were inspired by the works of Georgescu-Roegen. In 2002, Vincent Cheynet realized a dossier on
degrowth for the magazine Silence. Published initially in 5000 copies, the dossier had two
additionally prints. Next year, together with his colleagues Bruno Clémentin from Casseurs de pub
and Michel Bernard from Silence published the book Objectif décroissance sold in 8000 copies
and republished 3 times.
In 2002 ISESSD was founded and in September 2003 the institute organized the international
colloquium on Sustainable Degrowth in the city hall of Lyon with the participation of about 600
persons. In 2005, following the suggestion of Serge Latouche and the Economic Commission of
Greens a new colloquium on degrowth was organized.
In 2004 degrowth entered the public debate with the first issue of the periodical “La
Decroissance: Le Journal de la Joie de Vivre”. Initially published on a trimestrial basis, it is now
printed monthly in 45 000 to 60 000 copies. The journal is distributed in France, Switzerland,
Luxembourg, Belgium and Canada.
Many other French publications had popularized the years „2000, including large circulation
media. For instance, since 2006 Le Monde has published many articles on degrowth and contributed
to a large extent to the promotion of the movement. As well, several web pages are devoted to
degrowth in France: www.decroissance.net - the online version of the journal La decroissance,
www.decroissance.info – an independent website managed by local groups, www.decroissance.org
– the webpage of ISESSD.
The scientific journal Entropia was launched in 2006 at the French National Assembly by a
group of French academicians, including Serge Latouche, with the aim of

giving theoretical

substance to the idea of degrowth.
Several so called “marches for degrowth” took p lace in various places in France in the recent
years and Degrowth even has its own party in France: the Party for Degrowth (le Parti pour la
Décroissance - PPLD), founded on April 8, 2006 in Dijon. As stated on the webpage * , it calls for a
“degrowth based on equity, sustainability and values that are humanist, democratic, republican,
non-violent, defending human rights and fighting all forms of discrimination and totalitarianism”.
*

political debates during the presidential election campaigns, when all the candidates were
interpellated on this subject (Latouche, 2007).
In 2008, The First International Conference on Economic Degrowth for Ecological
Sustainability and Social Equity took place in Paris and witnessed the gathering of 140
multidisciplinary scientists. The event was successful: “for the first time, scientists got together in
an interdisciplinary and international academic setting with representatives of the civil society on
the topic of economic degrowth as a possible path for more ecology, more equality and more
wellbeing” (Schneider et al., 2010). The conference proved to be a milestone that developed
academic credibility of the subject of degrowth, idea mainly supported before by civil society
coalitions. Today the fertile ideas behind degrowth are progressively forming an established field of
research.

AN INCREASING AUDIENCE

Nowadays, the degrowth movement is “a rather loose and open network including a variety of
forums for circulating, sharing and debating ideas and experiences” (Fournier, 2008, p. 532). While
originating in France, the movement is increasingly gaining international audience and scope. First
in other Latin countries such as Italy and Spain and in francophone regions (such as the ones in
Belgium, Switzerland and Canada), degrowth is spreading to several other countries in Europe and
across the ocean in both its theoretical and practical dimensions.
Italy appears to be the second cradle of the movement in Europe, where both initiatives for
theoritization and divulgation of degrowth took place almost in parallel with the ones in France,
starting in 2004. La Rete per la decrescita* (Network for Degrowth) was founded by a group o f
activists and intellectuals coming from experiences of solidarity economy, criticism to
development, anti-utilitarism and bioeconomics. Today, the Association for Degrowth has
permanent courses on degrowth issues. In September 2011 they organized as well a summer school
on the subject of degrowth. Moreover, together with the City Hall of Venice, Udine University,
IUAV University, Research and Degrowth Network and other promoters, the association is
responsible for organizing in September 2012 The Third International Conference on Economic
Degrowth for Ecological Sustainability and Social Equity in Venice. One of the central figures on
the degrowth movement in Italy is Maurizio Pallante, who published since 2005 many books on
*

www.decrescita.it

networking the experiences of individuals, associations and comities of people in order to work
together for putting in practice the principles of degrowth.
A Party for Degrowth is active in Italy since July 2007, but degrowth entered the political
debate a year earlier, during the national presidential campaign. Pallante became councilor of the
new Green Minister of the Environment and Paolo Cacciary was elected deputy of Venice after
advocating for degrowth in “Thinking degrowth. Sustainability and Equity”, published in 2006
(Latouche, 2007, p. 18).
In Spain, the Catalonian Network for Degrowth, that today gathers over 1500 members, has
its origins back in 2006. Since that year they organised marches for degrowth, several discussion
sessions, workshops, presentations and other public events for promoting the idea. They even
developed a radio station on degrowth and initiated several projects in various fields such as
permaculture, cooperatives of autoproduction, cohousing. Other eight networks were created in
other regions of Spain. Between March 26th and 29th 2010 the Second International Conference on
Economic Degrowth for Ecological Sustainability and Social Equity was organized. More than 500
scientists, civil society members and practitioners from more than 40 countries joined the event
hosted at the historic building of Universidad de Barcelona.
In Belgium, The Political Movement of Growth Objectors - Le Mouvement politique des
objecteurs de croissance † was founded in 2009 on the 18th October at Brussels. In April 2009, at the
European Parliament building in Brussels, the Club of Rome together with other partners organized
the Workshop on Socially Sustainable Economic Degrowth ‡ .
In Switzerland in November 2008 the first group for promoting degrowth was founded – The
Swiss Network for Growth Objection (Reseau Objection de Croisssance Suisse) that developed first
on the canton of Genève and later on in Vaud and Neuchâtel. New groups were recently created in
Basel § and in Bern** . The platform www.decroissance.ch is an independent initiative promoting all
the activities directly or indirectly linked with degrowth in Switzerland.
In United Kingdom, The New Economic Foundation - NEF organized on January 12th 2010
the conference Rethinking economic growth, Towards an international degrowth network. The term
degrowth became accepted as the English translation for decroissance in 2008, at the international
conference on degrowth from Paris, so only very recently compared with the other countries listed

decroissance in French, numerous initiatives take place already in UK for promoting a transition
towards a future not based on economic growth. The pioneering work of NEF in advancing a new
economy for people and planet and not for profit is representative. NEF published several books
and articles directly linked with the economic degrowth (2010; 2009; 2006). Tim Jackson‟s book,
Prosperity without growth (2009) has gained a considerable atention in the degrowth debate for its
relevance for the transition towards a socio-economic system beyond growth. Transition Towns
Network * in United Kingdom and Ireland that has gradually developed since 2005, is by far one of
the most significant examples of how degrowth can lead to socially and economically sustainable
communities.
Amongst the Scandinavian countries, Finland appears as the initiator of the degrowth debate.
The website www.degrowth.fi represents the online interface of a project that studies degrowth and
takes it into practice in the Finnish context. According to the editors of the webpage, the project,
runned by a couple of researchers that are affiliated with the Aalto University School of Economics
in Helsinki, focuses on the cultural dimensions of degrowth and particularly on the contemporary
practices of citizens, firms, and other organizations that may either encourage or resist the spirit of
growth. In September 24th 2010 the Growth in Transition Conference was organized by The Finnish
Association for Nature Conservation in co-operation with Aalto University School of Economics,
Corporate Environmental and Social Responsibility Research Group and other partners. The
conference brought together over 550 participants including academics, politicians, NGOs,
businesses, the media, and the general public to explore limits to growth as well as possibilities for
ecologically and socially responsible economic models. In addition, more than 400 people watched
the conference on- line on the conference webpage †.
In Eastern Europe, in Hungary, in March 2011 the word degrowth made its way into the
public and academic debates as nemnövekedés, when the degrowth ambassador, Serge Latouche
launched the translation of his book Treaty for Degrowth, in Hungarian (Liegey, 2011).
In Romania, in 2010 the author of this article has contributed together with the French
Cultural Centre of Iasi and the Faculty of Economy and Business Administration from the
“Alexandru Ioan Cuza” University of Iaşi, to the organization of a scientific colloquium on the
aftermaths of the Copenhagen Summit of 2009 that gathered speakers from 7 countries. Following
the suggestion of the author, a session of this colloquium was devoted to degrowth. The session on

the advancement of the growth critiques and the degrowth alternatives locally.
From Europe, across the Atlantic, degrowth movement made its way in 2010 in Canada when
in April 2010 a first conference on Degrowth was organized in Vancouver and following its grand
success, a second one took place in the same city in June 2011 * . Out of a co-operative effort of four
Montreal Universities, a new international conference is scheduled between 14 th and 20th of May
2012 in Montreal †, focusing on the particular situations and dynamics of the Americas related to
degrowth.

CONCLUSIONS

The Romanian economist Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen, considered the intellectual founder of
degrowth, predicted that bioeconomy will be the language that will be spoken by all in the third
millennium. His prophecy seems to become true. Degrowth, on which the economist has insisted as
the only option for a sustainable socio-economic development, has an increasing resonance starting
with the years 2000.
The word decroissance, used for the first time in the‟70 in some French publications for
designating an alternative to the unsustainability of the economic growth, became an activist slogan
in the former decade – in France in 2001, in Italy in 2004 and in Catalunya in 2006, spreading
afterwards in other francophone and Latin regions and countries, including outside Europe. The
English degrowth was accepted at the first international conference on degrowth from 2008;- that
marks as well the extension of the movement in the academic sphere and in the international
debates of civil society.
The contemporary multidimensional crisis (undoubtedly more pronounced on its socio- human
dimension than on the financial and economic ones) offers an opportunity for the advancement of
degrowth: shows the limits of economics, allows the exposure of the growth fetishism as root of the
crisis and generates alternative discourses.
Economic degrowth does not appear as a new doctrine, a programme, an ideology or yet as
another economic theory. Because of the dynamic and complexity of its forms of expression a
comprehensive definition of degrowth is considered to be a difficult task. Nonetheless, from the
reference literature we distinguish some major features of degrowth: it appears as a transition that

*

ecological impact through reduction of production and consumption. This transition that goes far
beyond decoupling is voluntary and participatory, the degrowth process being a democratic one. As
well degrowth implies equity. Central in the movement is the quest for a high life standard where
the dichotomy quality and quantity is being stressed. Escaping of the economy and the
decolonization of the economic imagery represents the overarching theme of the movement.
The degrowth discourse has echo. As a discourse dominated by the quest for better world
alternatives, it is often interpreted as a new utopia. But it is natural to prefer the utopian discourse in
the place of the dystopian one. Because if we were to refer to the future world where business as
usual types of activities engendered by the imperative of growth will lead finally to a crisis that will
make degrowth inescapable, the scenery will be one of fear and authority and not one in which the
enjoyment of life prevails.
Degrowth is part of a social movement developed on the basis that the economy can degrow
in a democratic and equitable manner. Besides the academic, intellectual and political dimension of
the movement, the civil and the grass roots type of actions form the substantive weight of the
movement. (The various innovative experiences that bring degrowth in practice is the subject of a
subsequent paper with the doctoral research project.)

INTRODUCTION

Starting from the beginning of the previous decade, the new notion of degrowth - for many
years known only by experts in the field - has penetrated the academic, public and political spheres,
rapidly gaining notoriety particularly in Europe.
Only recently being used in economic and social debates, the degrowth perspectives are
founded as a reaction to the unsustainable trend of the current global development, coming from
intellectual sources that cover a relatively old history such as ecology and bioeconomy-and from the
addressing the limits to growth. This has become today both a practical necessity and a moral
imperative. The degrowth promoters add to this drawback a critique that is central in their
discourse: the natural social order. They are denying the contemporary order, insisting on people`s
liberation from the socio-economic imagery generated by the imperative of growth that reduces
people to simple production tools or to consumption units.
Thus degrowth movement implies a synthesis of social objectives (a development that
benefits all, that serves people and it is not served by people, qualitative and not quantitative) and of
ecological concerns (the sustainability of this development).
The paper`s aim is to conceptualize degrowth and to provide an overview of the chronological
landmarks that have brought to the fore the watchword of degrowth. The first section provides an
interpretation of the definitions of degrowth, drawing its main features. Section two and section
three emphasize the development of degrowth movement in France and its increasing audience in
several European countries, focusing on the tools and actors that served for its divulgation. T he
final part provides conclusions summarizing the main points of the paper and suggestions for
further research.

1.

DEFINING DEGROWTH

Key advocates of degrowth state clearly that degrowth it is not a concept per se but “a
political slogan with theoretical implications” (Bayon, Fabrice and Smith, 2011, p. 14; Latouche,
2010a, p. 17, 2010b, p. 519, 2007, p. 20), “a missile word for pulverizing the ideology in which
both the right and the left are swimming”(Ariès, 2010, p. 81; 2007, p. 159; 2005, p. 75), a “political
weapon to decolonize the collective imaginary and free it from the tyranny of growth” (Latouche,
2005a). Thus degrowth is not presented as a doctrine, a program, an ideology or another economic
theory (Martinez Allier et al., 2010, p. 1742; Flipo, 2008, p.26), but as “a symbolic challenge”
(Latouche, 2006b) to policies that herald economic growth as an end in itself. Degrowth is not to be
turned into a blueprint or an end in itself, but to remain a means for fostering a spirit of critique
(Ariès, 2005), for questioning the priority accorded to economic values and principles.
Due to the variety of sources, its complexity and multidimensional forms of expression, it is a
challenge to agree on a clear cut definition for degrowth. Another fellow degrowt h advocate, aware
of the dangers entitled by abstract ideas, Kallis (2010b), stated that degrowth is not meant to be a
complete theory or a new type of „„religion‟‟. In this sense he uttered that “if one is looking for a

fighting against”. Indeed, the lack of clear delimitation allows new forms of expressions of the
degrowth movement to move along the dynamic it entails. But at the same time, while having
positive implications by allowing freedom of interpretation, the lack of a common language for
foregrounding degrowth has negative outcomes such as the fact that it might create confusion. As
we will see below, Kallis (2010, p. 874) gives himself a definition in an attempt of defending
degrowth.
There is not a single referential text about sustainable degrowth that has yet found its way to
the wider academic and political arena, it was the case of the Brundtland Report or the Rio
Declaration for Sustainable Development in 1992 (Martinez Allier et al., 2010, p. 1742).
Commonly, degrowth appears as a potential emergent paradigm that can give a substantial
contribution in reversing the unsustainable path we are in. If this path is to be followed, its
promoters have to be able to describe clearly what degrowth is about.
In the French dictionary Larousse Illustré of 2010 degrowth is defined as policies promoting
a slowdown of the growth rate in a sustainable development perspective (Lavignotte, 2009, p.12).
The editors from The Institute of Economic and Social Studies for a Sustainable Degrowth stress
that this definition is totally flawed as its advocates (Ariès, 2010, 2008; Latouche, 2011a, 2011b,
2010) make clear that degrowth is not “negative growth” – but “an absurd and oxymoronical
expression that translates to a large extent the domination of the growth imagery” Latouche (2007,
p.21). Moreover the literature on degrowth issues provides an important body of virulent critiques
to sustainable development (Latouche, 2011b, 2010a, 2006, p. 30, 2004b, p. 51; Bayon et al., 2010,
pp.81-102; Bonaiuti, 2010, p. 2; Ariès, 2010, p. 258, 2009, p. 13; Pallante, 2009, p. 20; Fournier,
2008, p. 539; Wallenborn, 2008, pp. 228-229;)
Thus, according to IESSSD “degrowth reflects policies for promoting degrowth of the rich
countries, mostly, and aiming at escaping the economism (invasion of all the human and social
dimensions by the economy) (…) Sustainable degrowth is opposing the supporters of sustainable
development who believe that economic growth can be conjugated with the environmental
protection” (Lavignotte, 2009, p. 12).
One of the first attempts to give a comprehensive definition of degrowth comes from the
Conference on Economic De-growth for Ecological Sustainability and Social Equity held in Paris
(2008). Several academicians that approached the subject provided definitions based on their
consideration on degrowth. The table below presents a selection of definitions of degrowth from the

by authors from France, Spain and Italy.
Table 1 – Selected Definitions of Degrowth
Definiti ons of degrowth
“a voluntary transition towards a just, participatory, and ecologically sustainable society.
The objectives of degrowth are to meet basic human needs and ensure a high quality of
life, while reducing the ecological impact of the global economy to a sustain able level,
equitably distributed between nations”.
“(A society of degrowth) should be understood as a society built on quality rather than on
quantity, on cooperation rather than on competition […] hu manity liberated from
economis m for wh ich social justice is the objective”.
„Sustainable degrowth is both a banner associated with social and environmental
movements and an emergent concept in academic and intellectual circles, they are
interdependent and affect each other”.
“Sustainable degrowth can be defined from an ecological–economic perspective as a
socially sustainable and equitable reduction (and eventually stabilization) of society's
throughput”.
“Degrowth proposes the promotion of the most ample substitution possible of the goods
industrially produced and purchased in the commercial route with the autoproduction of
goods. In this choice, that implies a decrease of the GDP, we identify the possibil ity of an
extraordinary imp rovement of the individual and collective life, of the environmental
conditions and of the relations between peoples, states and culture”.
“Sustainable degrowth may be defined as an equitable downscaling of production and
consumption that increases human wellbeing and enhances ecological conditions at the
local and global level, in the short and long term”.

We distinguish from these definitions the key features that describe de notion of degrowth:
First, degrowth appears as a transition that requires a transformation of the global economic
system. As important advocates of degrowth clearly explain (Latouche, 2010, p. 521), the
movement does not advocate for degrowth for the sake of degrowth, an approach that would
describe the same symmetry of the imperative for chrematistic growth and would be absurd, but
degrowth is a process that aims at reversing the unsustainable path of our development. This feature
of escaping from the economy is seen by many authors as a critical one. Latouche (2010, p. 519,
2008; 2007, p. 22) states that it would be best to speak about “agrowth” instead of degrowth, as one
speaks as atheism: “It actually means quite precisely, the abandonment of a religion: the religion of
the economy, growth, progress and development”. In this sense, as Valerie Fournier clearly
emphasized as well (2008, p. 528), the degrowth movement‟s over-arching theme is escaping from
the economy as system of representation. In accordance with a humanist approach - this Cultural
Revolution is indispensable in order to achieve a life style change that is not only accepted and
unconstrained, but translated into development of the “enjoyment of life” (Lavignotte, 2009, p. 13).

important dimension of degrowth. But more than a decrease of consumption and production what is
also needed is the decolonization of the so called economic imagery. The “logic of economy”
requires a new approach, the myth of “limitless growth” needs to be abandoned because after
colonizing all territories of material goods and most part of the territories of services, “the
commodification has sent its vanguard on the mental territories” (Pallante, 2009, p. 12). Therefore
there is a need of an ecology of mind for decolonization of the mental environment.
Second, the obvious objective of degrowth is the reduction of the ecological impact through
the downscaling of production and consumption. Degrowth goes beyond decoupling material and
energy use from growth (dematerialization or green growth), postulating that efficiency
improvements alone are not sufficient and might be counterproductive (Schneider, 2010, p. 512)
because it would consist in a reduction of environmental impact through more efficient or cleaner
technologies, while keeping production and consumption growing, as indicated by the Jevons
Paradox (Polimeni et al., 2008; Polimeni & Polimeni, 2006). In this sense, degrowth advocates are
very firm concerning the distinction between sustainable development and sustainable degrowth
(Ariès, 2010, p. 13; Bonaiuti, 2010; Fournier, 2008, p. 539; Latouche, 2004b, p. 51; Levallois,
2010; Pallante, 2009, p. 20).
A third feature is that this transition is voluntary and participatory, therefore the process of
degrowth is democratic. It is widely accepted within the reference literature, that a definition of
degrowth based only on the reduction of metabolism in terms of material and energy flows
translates in a limited understanding of degrowth. For the degrowth scholars degrowth appears as
the result of a collective choice for a better living, not an imperative imposed by an external
authority. Therefore, degrowth is not defended as a necessity but as a choice, one that has to be
made democratically and openly (Latouche and Harpages, 2010, p. 38; Fournier, 2008; Flipo, 2008;
Schneider, 2010b; Latouche, 2010; Ariès, 2010; Mylondo, 2008, p. 175). Valerie Fournier clearly
emphasized this feature in a widely cited article: “Degrowth is offered as a way of avoiding
„„ecocracy‟‟ in the future, a path we could chose today to remain in a position to collectively and
democratically shape our future in the face of ecological degradation. The more we wait, the more
the shock imposed by the earth natural limits might be brutal and the risk of emerging
„„ecototalitarian‟‟ responses high. But whilst recognizing the threat of environmental degradation,
proponents of degrowth are not prepared to sacrifice democracy to some ecological imperative any
more than to economic or political imperatives” (Fournier, 2008, p. 236). Or as Latouche and
Harpages claimed (2010, p. 38), “the suffered degrowth has nothing to do with the chosen

the same message, Ariès (2010) insisted that degrowth is a choice that defenders would make
without the oncoming ecological crisis, “simply to be human”.
We find relevant to quote here Daly as well: “A condition of nongrowth can come about in
two ways: as a failure of a growth economy, or as the success of a steady-state economy. These two
cases are as different as night and day. No one denies that a failure of a growth economy to grow
brings unemployment and suffering. It is precisely to avoid the suffering of a failed growth
economy (we know growth cannot continue) that we advocate SSE” (1992, p. 126). Daly is the
disciple of Georgescu-Roegen and founder of the steady-state economy concept. Most of the
degrowth scholars admit that the transition of degrowth will lead to the stabilization of a stationary
state economy.
Fourth, the complex phenomenon of degrowth has a strong dimension of equity. Growth is
“intrinsically inequitable” (Lavignotte, 2009, p. 71) because it generated in the former four decades
an increase in disparities both internationally and intranationally, creating a mechanism that allowed
rich people to get richer and poor people to be poorer. Abundant official statis tics and papers
portray the co evolution of unprecedented growth and unparalleled disparities and this evidence is
one of the traditional critiques of growth. All degrowth partisans share the view that the transition
entailed by the degrowth process has to allow a redistribution of the global wealth so that a
degrowth society will be an equitable one - built on social justice. For Illich - maybe the most
important precursor of degrowth - equity is the fundamental value of a convivial society (1973, p.
37). Indeed, degrowth of the poor would be a “countersense” as Pallante (2009, p. 49) stressed. The
allowance for Southern countries or societies, where ecological impacts are low relative to their
biocapacity, to increase their material consumption and thus their ecological footprint, is an idea
explicitly favoured by Georgescu- Roegen as well (1975, p. 378).
A fifth characteristic of the degrowth perspective is the quest for a high quality of life that
moves the focus from more to better, addressing the dichotomy of having and being, and
challenging the significant distinction between the qualitative and the quantitative assets in one‟s
life. Therefore, degrowth does not equal a contraction but the enjoyment of life, a notion commonly
attributed to Georgescu-Roegen (1975, p. 18). He describes it as the true product of the economic
process. The paradigmatic proposition of degrowth that human progress without economic growth
is possible (Schneider et al., 2010, p. 512). Latouche (2010, p. 521) refers to it as a decrease of
“well- having” in order to improve “well-being”. The slogan moins des biens, plus des liens (less
goods, more links) (Ariès, 2010; Latouche and Harpages, 2010; Latouche, 2010 etc.) appears

going beyond the humans – things related to the humans – humans relation, in the very same sense
Karl Polanyi indicated in The Great Transformation (2001).

CHRONOLOGICAL

LANDMARKS

OF

THE

EMERGENCE

OF

LA

DECROISSANCE IN FRANCE

France is deemed on many grounds to be the cradle of the degrowth movement: first, in this
country several milestones took place in the previous decade setting the stage for what promises to
become a new paradigm; second, while the degrowth narrative is increasingly percolating new
territories, the main degrowth ambassadors are mostly French scholars and activists; third, even
though degrowth comes from multiple sources, important precursors of this emergent paradigm are
either French, coming from French speaking countries, or/and writing and publishing in French.
The notion of decroissance does not appear as such in any French dictionary of social
sciences before 2006 (Latouche, 2010a, p. 519, 2010b, p. 14). This indicates that in France as well
the use of the term in the field of economics is of very recent date.
While Lavignotte (2009, p. 11) stated that André Gorz was the first to use the term
decroissance in 1977, The Institute for Social and Economic Studies for Sustainable De growth –
hereafter ISESSD * , shows that the French philosopher André Amar used the term already in 1976
in the magazine Les cahiers de la Nef. The following year (after the presence of Nicholas
Georgescu-Roegen in France) André Gorz advocated already for degrowth in Ecology and Liberty
(1977).
Several reference authors that analyzed the subject of degrowth stated that the term originates
from the French word “decroissance; the same term was used for the translation of a collection of
essays written by the Romanian born economist – Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen (Latouche and
Harpages, 2010, p. 20, Martinez-Alier et al., 2010, p. 1741; Flipo, 2008; Schneider, 2010) – the
intellectual founder of degrowth. The translation of these scientific works by Jacques Grine vald and
Ivo Rens in 1979 into: Demain la Decroissance: Entropie, Ecologie, Economie was to become a
milestone in the degrowth movement.
In 1993, the French ecological magazine Silence, with the headquarters in Lyon, dedicated a
special issue to degrowth and to Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen, edited by Jacques Grinevald. But
during the two decades from 1979 to 1999, the word did not raise but very little attention.

same French city, in 2001, Bruno Clémentin and Vincent Cheynet, founded the magazine Casseurs
de pub, driving inspiration probably from the Canadian periodical Adbusters – the Journal of the
Mental Environment. They imagined the concept of sustainable degrowth (Lavingotte, 2009) and
opposed this concept to sustainable development. As mentioned on the webpage of ISESSD, they
were inspired by the works of Georgescu-Roegen. In 2002, Vincent Cheynet realized a dossier on
degrowth for the magazine Silence. Published initially in 5000 copies, the dossier had two
additionally prints. Next year, together with his colleagues Bruno Clémentin from Casseurs de pub
and Michel Bernard from Silence published the book Objectif décroissance sold in 8000 copies
and republished 3 times.
In 2002 ISESSD was founded and in September 2003 the institute organized the international
colloquium on Sustainable Degrowth in the city hall of Lyon with the participation of about 600
persons. In 2005, following the suggestion of Serge Latouche and the Economic Commission of
Greens a new colloquium on degrowth was organized.
In 2004 degrowth entered the public debate with the first issue of the periodical “La
Decroissance: Le Journal de la Joie de Vivre”. Initially published on a trimestrial basis, it is now
printed monthly in 45 000 to 60 000 copies. The journal is distributed in France, Switzerland,
Luxembourg, Belgium and Canada.
Many other French publications had popularized the years „2000, including large circulation
media. For instance, since 2006 Le Monde has published many articles on degrowth and contributed
to a large extent to the promotion of the movement. As well, several web pages are devoted to
degrowth in France: www.decroissance.net - the online version of the journal La decroissance,
www.decroissance.info – an independent website managed by local groups, www.decroissance.org
– the webpage of ISESSD.
The scientific journal Entropia was launched in 2006 at the French National Assembly by a
group of French academicians, including Serge Latouche, with the aim of

giving theoretical

substance to the idea of degrowth.
Several so called “marches for degrowth” took p lace in various places in France in the recent
years and Degrowth even has its own party in France: the Party for Degrowth (le Parti pour la
Décroissance - PPLD), founded on April 8, 2006 in Dijon. As stated on the webpage * , it calls for a
“degrowth based on equity, sustainability and values that are humanist, democratic, republican,
non-violent, defending human rights and fighting all forms of discrimination and totalitarianism”.

political debates during the presidential election campaigns, when all the candidates were
interpellated on this subject (Latouche, 2007).
In 2008, The First International Conference on Economic Degrowth for Ecological
Sustainability and Social Equity took place in Paris and witnessed the gathering of 140
multidisciplinary scientists. The event was successful: “for the first time, scientists got together in
an interdisciplinary and international academic setting with representatives of the civil society on
the topic of economic degrowth as a possible path for more ecology, more equality and more
wellbeing” (Schneider et al., 2010). The conference proved to be a milestone that developed
academic credibility of the subject of degrowth, idea mainly supported before by civil society
coalitions. Today the fertile ideas behind degrowth are progressively forming an established field of
research.

AN INCREASING AUDIENCE

Nowadays, the degrowth movement is “a rather loose and open network including a variety of
forums for circulating, sharing and debating ideas and experiences” (Fournier, 2008, p. 532). While
originating in France, the movement is increasingly gaining international audience and scope. First
in other Latin countries such as Italy and Spain and in francophone regions (such as the ones in
Belgium, Switzerland and Canada), degrowth is spreading to several other countries in Europe and
across the ocean in both its theoretical and practical dimensions.
Italy appears to be the second cradle of the movement in Europe, where both initiatives for
theoritization and divulgation of degrowth took place almost in parallel with the ones in France,
starting in 2004. La Rete per la decrescita* (Network for Degrowth) was founded by a group o f
activists and intellectuals coming from experiences of solidarity economy, criticism to
development, anti-utilitarism and bioeconomics. Today, the Association for Degrowth has
permanent courses on degrowth issues. In September 2011 they organized as well a summer school
on the subject of degrowth. Moreover, together with the City Hall of Venice, Udine University,
IUAV University, Research and Degrowth Network and other promoters, the association is
responsible for organizing in September 2012 The Third International Conference on Economic
Degrowth for Ecological Sustainability and Social Equity in Venice. One of the central figures on
the degrowth movement in Italy is Maurizio Pallante, who published since 2005 many books on
*

networking the experiences of individuals, associations and comities of people in order to work
together for putting in practice the principles of degrowth.
A Party for Degrowth is active in Italy since July 2007, but degrowth entered the political
debate a year earlier, during the national presidential campaign. Pallante became councilor of the
new Green Minister of the Environment and Paolo Cacciary was elected deputy of Venice after
advocating for degrowth in “Thinking degrowth. Sustainability and Equity”, published in 2006
(Latouche, 2007, p. 18).
In Spain, the Catalonian Network for Degrowth, that today gathers over 1500 members, has
its origins back in 2006. Since that year they organised marches for degrowth, several discussion
sessions, workshops, presentations and other public events for promoting the idea. They even
developed a radio station on degrowth and initiated several projects in various fields such as
permaculture, cooperatives of autoproduction, cohousing. Other eight networks were created in
other regions of Spain. Between March 26th and 29th 2010 the Second International Conference on
Economic Degrowth for Ecological Sustainability and Social Equity was organized. More than 500
scientists, civil society members and practitioners from more than 40 countries joined the event
hosted at the historic building of Universidad de Barcelona.
In Belgium, The Political Movement of Growth Objectors - Le Mouvement politique des
objecteurs de croissance † was founded in 2009 on the 18th October at Brussels. In April 2009, at the
European Parliament building in Brussels, the Club of Rome together with other partners organized
the Workshop on Socially Sustainable Economic Degrowth ‡ .
In Switzerland in November 2008 the first group for promoting degrowth was founded – The
Swiss Network for Growth Objection (Reseau Objection de Croisssance Suisse) that developed first
on the canton of Genève and later on in Vaud and Neuchâtel. New groups were recently created in
Basel § and in Bern** . The platform www.decroissance.ch is an independent initiative promoting all
the activities directly or indirectly linked with degrowth in Switzerland.
In United Kingdom, The New Economic Foundation - NEF organized on January 12th 2010
the conference Rethinking economic growth, Towards an international degrowth network. The term
degrowth became accepted as the English translation for decroissance in 2008, at the international
conference on degrowth from Paris, so only very recently compared with the other countries listed

decroissance in French, numerous initiatives take place already in UK for promoting a transition
towards a future not based on economic growth. The pioneering work of NEF in advancing a new
economy for people and planet and not for profit is representative. NEF published several books
and articles directly linked with the economic degrowth (2010; 2009; 2006). Tim Jackson‟s book,
Prosperity without growth (2009) has gained a considerable atention in the degrowth debate for its
relevance for the transition towards a socio-economic system beyond growth. Transition Towns
Network * in United Kingdom and Ireland that has gradually developed since 2005, is by far one of
the most significant examples of how degrowth can lead to socially and economically sustainable
communities.
Amongst the Scandinavian countries, Finland appears as the initiator of the degrowth debate.
The website www.degrowth.fi represents the online interface of a project that studies degrowth and
takes it into practice in the Finnish context. According to the editors of the webpage, the project,
runned by a couple of researchers that are affiliated with the Aalto University School of Economics
in Helsinki, focuses on the cultural dimensions of degrowth and particularly on the contemporary
practices of citizens, firms, and other organizations that may either encourage or resist the spirit of
growth. In September 24th 2010 the Growth in Transition Conference was organized by The Finnish
Association for Nature Conservation in co-operation with Aalto University School of Economics,
Corporate Environmental and Social Responsibility Research Group and other partners. The
conference brought together over 550 participants including academics, politicians, NGOs,
businesses, the media, and the general public to explore limits to growth as well as possibilities for
ecologically and socially responsible economic models. In addition, more than 400 people watched
the conference on- line on the conference webpage †.
In Eastern Europe, in Hungary, in March 2011 the word degrowth made its way into the
public and academic debates as nemnövekedés, when the degrowth ambassador, Serge Latouche
launched the translation of his book Treaty for Degrowth, in Hungarian (Liegey, 2011).
In Romania, in 2010 the author of this article has contributed together with the French
Cultural Centre of Iasi and the Faculty of Economy and Business Administration from the
“Alexandru Ioan Cuza” University of Iaşi, to the organization of a scientific colloquium on the
aftermaths of the Copenhagen Summit of 2009 that gathered speakers from 7 countries. Following
the suggestion of the author, a session of this colloquium was devoted to degrowth. The session on

the advancement of the growth critiques and the degrowth alternatives locally.
From Europe, across the Atlantic, degrowth movement made its way in 2010 in Canada when
in April 2010 a first conference on Degrowth was organized in Vancouver and following its grand
success, a second one took place in the same city in June 2011 * . Out of a co-operative effort of four
Montreal Universities, a new international conference is scheduled between 14 th and 20th of May
2012 in Montreal †, focusing on the particular situations and dynamics of the Americas related to
degrowth.

CONCLUSIONS

The Romanian economist Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen, considered the intellectual founder of
degrowth, predicted that bioeconomy will be the language that will be spoken by all in the third
millennium. His prophecy seems to become true. Degrowth, on which the economist has insisted as
the only option for a sustainable socio-economic development, has an increasing resonance starting
with the years 2000.
The word decroissance, used for the first time in the‟70 in some French publications for
designating an alternative to the unsustainability of the economic growth, became an activist slogan
in the former decade – in France in 2001, in Italy in 2004 and in Catalunya in 2006, spreading
afterwards in other francophone and Latin regions and countries, including outside Europe. The
English degrowth was accepted at the first international conference on degrowth from 2008;- that
marks as well the extension of the movement in the academic sphere and in the international
debates of civil society.
The contemporary multidimensional crisis (undoubtedly more pronounced on its socio- human
dimension than on the financial and economic ones) offers an opportunity for the advancement of
degrowth: shows the limits of economics, allows the exposure of the growth fetishism as root of the
crisis and generates alternative discourses.
Economic degrowth does not appear as a new doctrine, a programme, an ideology or yet as
another economic theory. Because of the dynamic and complexity of its forms of expression a
comprehensive definition of degrowth is considered to be a difficult task. Nonetheless, from the
reference literature we distinguish some major features of degrowth: it appears as a transition that

ecological impact through reduction of production and consumption. This transition that goes far
beyond decoupling is voluntary and participatory, the degrowth process being a democratic one. As
well degrowth implies equity. Central in the movement is the quest for a high life standard where
the dichotomy quality and quantity is being stressed. Escaping of the economy and the
decolonization of the economic imagery represents the overarching theme of the movement.
The degrowth discourse has echo. As a discourse dominated by the quest for better world
alternatives, it is often interpreted as a new utopia. But it is natural to prefer the utopian discourse in
the place of the dystopian one. Because if we were to refer to the future world where business as
usual types of activities engendered by the imperative of growth will lead finally to a crisis that will
make degrowth inescapable, the scenery will be one of fear and authority and not one in which the
enjoyment of life prevails.
Degrowth is part of a social movement developed on the basis that the economy can degrow
in a democratic and equitable manner. Besides the academic, intellectual and political dimension of
the movement, the civil and the grass roots type of actions form the substantive weight of the
movement. (The various innovative experiences that bring degrowth in practice is the subject of a
subsequent paper with the doctoral research project.)
