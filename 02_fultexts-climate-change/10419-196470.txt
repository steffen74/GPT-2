Introduction
Concern for environmental protection and the implementation of measures against climate
change are issues that have been more often on the agenda of governmental institutions and
researchers worldwide. Therefore, a large number of reports and academic studies have
been written lately bringing arguments in favour of maintaining sustainable economic
growth that would be based on environmental principles and be aimed at producing
renewable biological resources and converting them into bioenergy and biotechnological
products (Ronzon et al., 2017; Carus and Dammer, 2018). In this context, there has
appeared a new paradigm of economic thought called bioeconomy that refers to sustainable
development and smart use of technology (Voineagu, 2006; European Commission, 2012;
Ronzon et al., 2017). The studies on human behaviour mechanisms show the likely effects
of an economic model based on green jobs creation, the growth of gross domestic product
(GDP), environmental protection and national security (Lehr, Lutz and Edler, 2012; Yi,
2013; Golden and Handfield, 2014; Dinu, 2008). Most studies and governmental reports
pay a special attention to green jobs creation as they are involved in economic growth
(OECD, 2011; Yi, 2013), but there are critics arguing that in some cases the main reason
for green jobs creation is economic gain and not the environmental protection (Michaels
and Murphy, 2009; Rabe, 2014; Bowen and Kuralbayeva, 2015). A current challenge for
researchers has been to identify and understand the way in which the factors related to the
creation of jobs may be controlled by the management or governmental institutions for
developing new behavioural models. The study deals with this research issue.
The aim of this paper is to develop a profile of companies that are able to create new jobs.
For this purpose, the literature in the field has been reviewed in order to identify the factors
contributing to green jobs creation (objective 1). The outcomes of literature review have
been used to formulate the research hypotheses in the methodology section. Testing the
correlation of factors related to green jobs creation (Obiective 2) involves the study of data
from secondary data, namely, the Eurobarameter Flash 456 – SMEs, resource efficiency and
green markets (European Commission, 2018). Processing, analysis and interpretation of
results was initially made using descriptive methods, and then using multilevel logistic
regression. The article ends with the presentation of results.

1. Literature review
Environmental sustainable economic development and green job creation have been the
main concern of researchers and governmental institutions. Therefore, there is a broad
literature dealing with these two linked issues, and the findings of studies often report
contradictory findings. First, it is due to the fact that the process of environmental
economic development specific to bioeconomy is complex and long-term, and its results
cannot be accurately foreseen (Mawby et al., 2016; Țugulea, 2017). Second, current
economic studies (Wei, Patadia and Kammen, 2010; Golden and Handfield, 2014;
Sillanpää and Ncibi, 2017) have succeeded in presenting only the influence of specific
factors (for example, analysis of modification of GDP values) on economic development in
terms of creation of new jobs or have examined just specific aspects of this phenomenon
(for example, the area of green energy in relation with green economic growth).
Chapple et al. (2011, p.5) define green economy as “economic activity that reduces the
consumption of energy and improves the quality of environment”. Practically, green
economic development refers to the implementation by companies of measures for effective
use of resources (Cai et al., 2011; Martinez-Fernandez, Hinojosa and Miranda, 2010).
Another broader perspective presents three main features that could describe green
economic development: provides activity in sectors belonging to green industry, contributes
to job creation and responds to strategic actions initiated by governmental policies (Yi,
2013). So, we may observe by analysing these definitions that there is a link between the
two concepts, green economic development supporting the creation of green jobs.
From the perspective of international organisations initiating legislative proposals and
economic policies, creation of green jobs is an important benefit obtained after the
implementation of economic growth policies. International Labour Organization (ILO)
considers that green jobs play the role of contributing to protection and renewal of the
environment. Also, these jobs should have decent conditions, namely, ensure a proper
salary, secure work conditions, and opportunities for career development (ILO, 2015).
Providing these conditions extends the criteria for defining green jobs and contributes to
reaching the important goal of governmental policies: poverty eradication (ILO, 2018).
UECD reports (United Nations Environment Programme) underline the ambiguous nature
of definitions provided by literature and stress out that technology is evolving and what was
viewed as environmental a few years ago, might not be viewed as such now. In addition,
criteria used to view a job as being green could be debatable depending on the level of
economic and technological development of a specific country (Yi, 2013; Bowen and
Kuralbayeva, 2015; OECD, 2017).
Wandzich and Płaza (2017) present the evolution over time of definitions for green jobs.
Initially these played the role of protecting natural environment and were associated with green
industry and bioeconomy. Now, there are low-carbon jobs, energy-efficiency job, and green
jobs found along the logistic chain ensuring the production of green goods and services even if
the job as such involves contact with non-environmental products and technologies. Therefore,
the author presents green jobs as a generic term given to a wide range of jobs from different
sectors of bioeconomy involving various work conditions and qualifications.
Most studies report a positive relation between green sustainable economic growth and job
creation (Rabe, 2004; Yi, 2013). Models of sustainable economic development show a
relation of interdependence between effective allocation of resources, sustainable economic
growth, protection of environment and adoption of new green technologies and innovation
Lehr, Lutz and Edler, 2012). The outcomes of this process have been intensely dealt with in
the literature in the field and in economic policies as they contribute to the understanding of
human behaviour mechanisms searching social welfare: increase of quality of life,
protection of natural resources and biosphere, reduction of pollution, adaptation to climate
change etc. (OECD, 2010; PEP, 2012; Pociovalișteanu et al., 2015; ILO, 2016; Dinu,
Schileru and Atanase, 2012).
The theoretical model developed by Pociovălișteanu et al. (2015) describes a relation of
interdependence between environmental protection and green economic growth through job
creation and change in behaviour of consumption and production and sustainable
development. Other studies on energy industry (Pollin et al., 2008; Apergis and Payne,
2010; Wei, Patadia and Kammen, 2010; Cetin and Egrican, 2011; Lehr, Lutz and Edler,
2012) support taking measures for more efficient use of resources, and implicitly, economic
growth by creating green jobs. These studies make forecasts anticipating progress
generating potential by increasing the number of jobs in specific sectors of industry.
There are more sceptical authors who believe that programs aimed to stimulate the number
of green jobs and green investments only play the role of destabilizing the current industry
and mobilizing considerable funds towards other areas to the detriment of implementing
current investment programs (Cai et al., 2011; Cock, 2014; Forstater, 2014; Rabe, 2014;
Bowen and Kuralbayeva, 2015). High additional costs of green job creation (Bowen and
Kuralbayeva, 2015), lack of data for correct forecasts (Deschênes, 2013; Wandzich and
Płaza, 2017) or bulky legislation comprising vague terminology that may be difficult to put
into practice (Morriss et al., 2009) are just a few areas of vulnerability reported by
researchers that question the main role of green jobs for economic development.
To identify the behavioural models involved in the process of green production, it is first
required to develop a profile of companies employing personnel for green jobs (Jijie and
Bobâlcă, 2009). Numerous studies have analysed the causal relationships between the
following factors and green jobs creation: type of business (production or services) (Russo
and Fouts, 1997; Wei, Patadia and Kammen, 2010; Singh and Fers, 2011; Ronzon et al.,
2017); turnover (Fierman, 1991; Koch and McGrath, 1995; Pujaria, Wrightb and Peattiec,
2003; Lehr, Lutz and Edler, 2012); turnover evolution (Russo and Fouts, 1997; Ronzon et
al., 2017). In other studies, green jobs are associated with traditional and big companies
(Martinez-Fernandez, Hinojosa and Miranda, 2010). Other studies report a relation between
company performance operating in the environmental sector and its size (Arda, Bayraktar
and Tatoglu, 2018). Accordingly, considering that company performance contributes to the
creation of green jobs (Pujaria, Wrightb and Peattiec, 2003; Lehr, Lutz and Edler, 2012).
Studies investigating current jobs in green industries report that it is more likely for
companies operating in B2B (business-to-business), selling goods and services to other
businesses, than for companies selling to end-users (B2C: business-to-consumer) to employ
personnel for green operations. The research underlines the fact that the increase of
technological development imposes the creation of new economic models and implicitly a
higher openness towards new ways of selling products (Ronzon et al., 2017; Wandzich and
Płaza, 2017).
The reports of international organisations promoting sustainable economic development
and adoption of bioeconomy principles include accurate data on the results obtained in
countries with a higher level of development, such as Germany, Sweden, Norway, France,
Austria. These countries have already implemented programs for the labour market aimed
to create green jobs that generated profitability for the employing company (Ge and Zhi,
2016; Altenburg and Assmann, 2017; Ronzon et al. 2017; OECD, 2017). Other studies
support the idea that new technologies adoption may be easier to implement in less
developed than in developed countries that already have a strong industry, which would be
costlier to restructure, and have a workforce, which, in some cases, could be more difficult
to requalify (Bowen and Kuralbayeva, 2015; Wandzich and Płaza, 2017). There are other
views supporting also other factors for evaluating the opportunities for green jobs creation
depending on their belonging to a more or less developed state. These studies report the
type of industry (for example, green energy industry in more developed states is linked to a
higher number of new jobs) or level of development and implementation of governmental
environmental policies (for example, a less developed state with an adequate legislation
providing tax facilities has better chances to create green jobs) (Pollin et al., 2008; Wei,
Patadia and Kammen, 2010; Cai et al., 2011).

2. Methodology
In the methodological approach we considered the view of some authors (Russo and Fouts,
1997) who observe that the aligning of production standards to requirements of
environmental protection is a complex process that involves, besides the above mentioned
factors, (green economic growth, sector, company size, company age, turnover and
turnover evolution, type of client for sale of goods or services, and the country) also the
factors related to the implementation of a new organizational culture and a new human
resources and information management system.
The research question aims to identify and understand the way in which the factors related
to creation of jobs may be controlled by the management or governmental institutions for
developing new behavioural models. Therefore, the aim of the study is to develop a profile
of companies able to create new jobs and it aims to reach the following objectives:
 Objective 1: to identify the factors contributing to green jobs creation;
 Objective 2: to test the correlation of factors related to green jobs creation.
The literature review of previous studies showed a series of factors related to green jobs
creation contributing to reaching the first objective. The second objective includes testing
the following hypotheses formulated based on the review of the literature in the field (for
example, Fierman, 1991; Koch and McGrath, 1995; Russo and Fouts, 1997; Pujaria,
Wrightb and Peattiec, 2003; Wei, Patadia and Kammen, 2010; Singh and Fers, 2011; Lehr,
Lutz and Edler, 2012; Ge and Zhi, 2016; OECD, 2017; UNEP, 2017).
 Hypothesis 1: The more resource efficiency actions a company is taking, the more
likely it is for employees to have a green job.
 Hypothesis 2: Green employment varies by company features (sector of activity,
company size, company age, turnover, turnover evolution). Green employment is more
common in: H2a: industry; H2b: large firms; H2c: older firms; H2d: companies with high
turnover; H2e: companies with positive turnover evolution.
 Hypothesis 3: Companies selling products or services to other companies (B2B) are
more likely to have employees working in green jobs.
 Hypothesis 4: Companies in developed EU countries are more likely to have
employees working in green jobs than those in less developed EU countries.
In order to evaluate the proposed hypotheses, this study uses the Flash Eurobarometer
456 ‒ SMEs, resource efficiency and green markets (European Commission, 2018),
conducted between 11th and 26th of September 2017. Alongside other countries, the survey
was carried out as well in the 28 Member states of the European Union. For the purpose of
this study, the selected sample comprises active businesses employing one or more people
in EU28. Across EU28, 13,117 interviews were conducted with the management of
investigated companies. According to the Flash Eurobarometer technical specifications, the
sample was selected from an international business database (where necessary, additional
sample from local sources was added) and covers both SMEs and large companies
(European Commission, 2017). In this study, considering the particularities of multi-level
logistic regression, the dependent variable measures whether companies have full time

employees working in green jobs (at least some of the time) and is based on a dummy
variable with recoded value 1 if the company has employees in a green job and 0 otherwise.
The “green job” was defined as “a job that directly deals with information, technologies, or
materials that preserves or restores environmental quality. This requires specialised skills,
knowledge, training, or experience (e.g. verifying compliance with environmental
legislation, monitoring resource efficiency within the company, promoting and selling
green products and services)” (European Commission, 2017).
To analyse H1 regarding whether the likelihood to have employees in a green job is
associated with resource efficiency oriented firms, a Resource Efficiency Index is
constructed. The index comprise the number of actions companies are taking to be more
resource efficient and is measures on a scale from 1 to 4 (where 1 means no actions and 4
means many actions). The list of actions considered to be more resource efficient included:
a) Saving water; b) Saving energy; c) Using predominantly renewable energy (e.g.
including own production through solar panels, etc.); d) Saving materials; e) Minimising
waste; f) Selling scrap material to another company; g) Recycling, by reusing material or
waste within the company; h) Designing products that are easier to maintain, repair or
reuse; i) Other action to promote resource efficiency. The higher the index value, the more
resource efficient is the firm.
The other independent variables used to analyse which companies are more likely to have
employees in a green job (H2-H4, according to results in previous studies, Fierman, 1991;
Koch and McGrath, 1995; Russo and Fouts, 1997; Pujaria, Wrightb and Peattiec, 2003;
Wei, Patadia and Kammen, 2010; Singh and Fers, 2011; Lehr, Lutz and Edler, 2012; Ge
and Zhi, 2016; OECD, 2017) are: sector of activity, company size, company age, turnover,
and turnover evolution, type of client for selling products or services, and country.
To analyse the results, we firstly used a descriptive analysis by country, and secondly, a
multi-level logistic regression analysis. The multi-level logistic regression was employed
due to the hierarchical nature of the data, namely companies (i) nested within countries (j).
Considering the particularities of this study, the analysis is conducted according to the
following model specification (Steele, 2009):
log(

𝜋𝑖𝑗
1−𝜋𝑖𝑗

) = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1 𝑋𝑖𝑗 + 𝑢𝑗

(1)

Where:
𝜋𝑖𝑗 - the likelihood to have employees in a green job;
𝛽0 - the overall intercept;
𝛽1 - the cluster specific effect;
𝑋𝑖𝑗 - the vector with explanatory variables;
𝑢𝑗 - the group (random) effect.
For the descriptive analysis, likewise previous studies using similar data (Williams and
Horodnic, 2015a; 2015b; 2016; 2017, 2018a, 2018b; Horodnic and Williams, 2018;
Horodnic, Mazilu and Oprea, 2018; Horodnic et al., 2018; Luca et al., 2018) and as
recommended in the Eurobarometer methodology, we used the sampling weighting scheme.

In a first stage, the multivariate analysis is here conducted using crude data and without
weighting scheme. However, in the second stage weighting scheme is used as well as
imputations for missing data to demonstrate the robustness of the findings. The results are
also used to graphically display whether significant variations between countries exist in
the likelihood to have green employment. The data analyis presented in the tables was
carried out using STATA software, version 14.
3. Results and discussions
Overall, 40% of companies in EU28 have at least one full time employee working in green
jobs at least some of the time. As table no. 1 displays, the distribution of green employment is
uneven across countries. For instance, green employment is more common in Latvia (64% of
all companies having at least one full time employee working in green jobs at least some of the
time), Croatia (58%) and Italy (57%) and less likely in Malta (7%) and Estonia (15%).

To analyse which type of firms are more likely to be associated with green employment, table
no. 2 reports the results of a multi-level logistic regression analysis. Model 1 in table 2 reveals
that there is a positive relationship between green employment and Resource Efficiency
Index. The higher the index value (the more resource efficiency actions a company is taking),
the higher the likelihood to have employees in a green job (confirming H1).
Model 1 in table no. 2 also reveals that green employment is more common for certain
categories of firms. Companies in industry sector are more likely while those in services
sector are less likely to have employees in a green job than companies in manufacturing
sector (confirming H2a). Similarly, not only are larger companies (50 employees or more)

more likely to have employees in a green job (confirming H2b), but so too are those with a
turnover higher than 50 million euros (confirming H2d). Indeed, companies registering a
decreased turnover over the past two years are less likely to participate in green
employment than companies who increased their turnover over the past two years
(confirming H2e). However, no statistically significant association was identified between
green employment and the year when the company was established (refuting H2c).
Similarly, according to Model 1 in table no. 2, no strong association was identified between
green employment and the type of client for selling products or services (refuting H3).
In addition, Model 2 and Model 3 in table no. 2 reveal that the same results are obtained if
running the regression by using the weighting scheme or imputations for missing data).

To determine whether significant variations between countries exist in the propensity to
have green employment, after controlling for variables in Model 1, figure no. 1 displays the
residual country effects.

A country whose confidence interval (5% significance level) does not overlap the line at
zero differs significantly from the EU28 average. For instance, at the lower end, companies
in Malta, Estonia and Lithuania have a significantly lower propensity to have employees in
a green job. At the upper end, companies in Latvia, Croatia, Slovakia, Italy, Sweden and
Finland have a significantly higher propensity to have employees in a green job. Figure 1

therefore reveals that not always companies in affluent countries (e.g., Germany, United
Kingdom, France) have significantly higher propensity to have employees working in green
jobs than those in less affluent countries (refuting H4).

The profile of companies operating in the green sector is another issue investigated in this
study as the variables used for this profile reflect concrete aspects that may be quantified by
company managers who have to adopt a new bioeconomic behavioural model in developing
their strategies. Therefore, manufacturing big companies (over 50 employees) with a
positive turnover evolution are more likely to employ personnel for green jobs. Also, the
study has confirmed the results of other studies linking green jobs creation with goods
manufacturing sector to the detriment of service companies (Russo and Fouts, 1997; Wei,
Patadia and Kammen, 2010; Singh and Fers, 2011; Ronzon et al., 2017). Although the
company age on a market is a profitability index, this study has not found a direct link
between company age and likelihood of green jobs creation.
Modern model of sales operations management led to a natural separation of companies:
B2B interacting with legal entities (other companies) and companies selling services
directly to consumers (end users). Even if some studies report a higher likelihood for B2B
to have green operations and employ personnel for green jobs (Ronzon et al., 2017;
Wandzich and Płaza, 2017), this study has not confirmed this hypothesis. The fact that B2B
and B2C companies have similar behaviour when they take decisions regarding green
operations, including green jobs creation, may be explained by recent high mediatisation of
governmental policies stimulating green behaviour or increased understanding of
importance of green practices by direct experience or market studies.
In what regards the employing company, the findings show that companies in developed
countries (e.g. Germany, Great Britain, France) do not always have significantly higher
likelihood to have green jobs personnel compared to less affluent companies. This result
confirms the findings of studies supporting the opportunity of green jobs creation in less
developed countries lacking an already functioning industrial infrastructure (Bowen and
Kuralbayeva, 2015; Wandzich and Płaza, 2017), and studies considering other factors, such
as type of industry or level of implementation of governmental green policies (Pollin et al.,
2008; Wei, Patadia and Kammen, 2010; Cai et al., 2011).
Conclusions
Once new jobs have been created, there takes place an ecologisation of processes of
production and consumption leading to higher quality of life and changed consumption
behaviour of the population. This study investigates the implications of green jobs creation
in employing companies of the European Union (EU28)
From a theoretical perspective, the conducted analysis was aimed to clarify specific
divergent vies in the literature in the field dealing with the impact of green jobs creation in
the context of inherent changes occurring in a world under a process of transition towards
implementation of principles of economic growth specific to bioeconomy. Efficient use of
resources has been the main recommendation given by researchers and institutions
initiating green public policies and is most commonly accompanied by economic growth
and profitability. In this study, we have analysed the likelihood of a relation between green
jobs and efficient use of resources, and implicitly economic progress. The obtained results
are similar to the results reported in previous studies (Rabe, 2004; Luca and Creţescu, 2010;
Lehr, Lutz and Edler, 2012; Yi, 2013; Pociovălișteanu et al., 2015). Moreover, the study
suggests and develops an index for efficient use of resources that includes the
implementation ofa set of green measures. The literature review also underlines a lack of
uniform methods for measuring and forecasting the effects of green jobs creation. The
instrument used in this study comprises the variables identifies in earlier studies and that
have been validated by the decision-makers in companies opearting in 28 European
countries. Also, the implementation of this instrument may contribute to solving a
controversial issue reported by the literature in the field: lack of uniform methods for
measuring and forecasting the effects of green jobs creation. (Pollin et al., 2008; Bowen and
Kuralbayeva, 2015; Altenburg and Assmann, 2017).
While there are voices supporting that profitability and economic growth may be achieved
by unjustified consumption of natural resources and environmental protection is an expense
for companies to the detriment of profitability, this study confirms what most previous
studies claim, namely, the fact that efficient use of resources and green jobs creation bring
profit to companies, and implicitly lead to higher turnover and its positive evolution also for
companies in less developed European countries.
The practical contributions of the study refer to underlining measures accepted at the
European level that may be implemented by companies to protect the environment. The
profile of companies employing personnel for green jobs is extremely practical as it comprises
quantifiable variables that may be used by managers of companies in the green sector. Also,
governmental institutions and reserchers could use them to write country reports and studies
analysing the behaviour of companies in Europe employing personnel for green jobs.
The paper discusses a current issue stirring the interest of researchers and decision-makers
initiating governmental policies, which leads to an increasing number of studies and reports
on the implications of green jobs creation in the context of transition to bioeconomy. Lack
of a unifies viewpoint on the methods for defining and measuring this concept is a
limitation applicable to this study. Another limitation of this study is lack of longitudinal
data allowing us to test a relation of causal type. Although the study provides input on the
relation among the variables, the analysis is still of descriptive type
The analysed issue, green jobs creation, is the main element for the implementation of
bioeconomic mechanisms together with other factors, such as increase of gross domestic
product (GDP), environmental protection and natural security. For a broader view on the
implications of behavioural variables on the process of transition to bioeconomy, future
studies could test the links among these factors and variables describing the profile of

companies employing personnel involved in green operations that have been confirmed by
this study: manufacturing big companies, with effective use of resources, with over 50
employees, a turnover over 500 million Euro, and a positive evolution of turnover
irrespective of the type pf operations (B2B or B2C) or country of origin.
