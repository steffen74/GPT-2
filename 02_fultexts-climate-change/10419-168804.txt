Introduction
The companies that managed to survive the current economic and financial crisis—often
resulting in contraction of supply markets and a limitation of access to various resources or
raw materials, and in a shrinking of outlets as a result of consumers’ changed preferences,
desires and attitudes and a relatively multifaceted behaviour (Dabija, Pop, 2013)—had to
address pressing challenges caused by the need to keep their position on the market, the
intensification of competition and the worsening of market conditions provoked, by the
changes in environment protection or consumer rights legislation.
It is impossible to set objectives able to meet these requirements or successfully implement
strategies capable of ensuring a healthy increase and a consistent development of the
company without considering the sustainability of the actions conducted and their impact
on the environment, society or the effectiveness of its own activities. Developing and, in
particular, pursuing a long-term vision represents an advantage of the company that thinks
and acts by the principles of sustainability, which ensures the ongoing development of its
own activities. The company’s management must build on its competitive financial or
technological capital (infrastructure, innovation etc.) (Martin, Shouten, 2012) which
generates unique advantages, differentiation opportunities and particularly a long-lasting
relationship with customers. Therefore, it is only normal for decision-making factors to
consider the ways in which one can harness the principles and dimensions of sustainability
and always attempt to find out the proper means to harmonize the social, environment and
economic aspects with the company’s own objectives, strategies and tactics.
It becomes imperative, within this context, that the concept of sustainable development
along with its facets should be applied to the different economic sectors as well as to
retailing, tourism, manufacturing or service industry etc. (Pelău, Fufezan, 2009). The
people responsible for developing a business are often found to be visionless, even inert in
applying consistently and pertinently the principles of sustainability. These shortcomings
are the outcome of the lack of experience in managing sustainability components and of the
inability to develop an integrated vision for their own business. Other limitations stem from
a lack of understanding of the place, role and importance for their business of the
philosophy of sustainability, the estimation that implementation costs might be too high or
the lack of time to turn the principles of sustainability into good results (adapted by
Hobson, Essex, 2001).
The authors of the current research, being aware of these limits, attempt to identify the
relevant aspects of sustainable development in the Romanian hospitality industry and
highlight consumers’ approach to the social, environment and economic dimensions and
how these impact on tourists’ satisfaction with the products and services of the tourist
accommodation units. The authors conduct an exploratory study whereby they attempt to
blaze a trail for the scientific research of the sustainability of Romanian tourism businesses.

The issue of business sustainability and how this concept is being translated into daily
practice has been dealt with for quite a long time. Understood as a system’s capacity for
self-preservation and renewal (Martin, Shouten, 2012), business sustainability has been
intensely debated for more than three decades, when researchers and practitioners began to
be fully aware that the exploitation of natural resources would surpass in scope the
possibilities of their being reproduced. As the gap between the consumption of natural
resources, so needed to ensure mankind’s living, and the pace of their renewal will widen,
this will impact on both the environment and the amount of resources and raw materials
available to future generations (Counsell, 1998). The Bruntland Report published by World
Commission on Environment and Development (WCED, 1987) stated that public and
private organizations should assume greater responsibility for their activity in general and,
in particular, for their actions, strategies and tactics which affect the environment or
society. The Commission Report was the first to officially approach sustainable
development which was defined as “the development that meets the needs of the present
without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs” (WCED,
1987; Martin, Shouten, 2012).
This document served as basis for subsequent debates on sustainable development both
among researchers (Srivastava, 1995) and within meetings of international organizations
(Earth Summit 1992) focused on formulating and implementing sustainable developmentoriented actions and/or strategies (Hobson, Essex, 2001). According to researchers,
sustainable development of a business means finding those market opportunities that allow
the company to generate a competitive advantage by the harmonious and synergic blend
and integration of economic, social and environment dimensions (Elkington, 1994). The
sustainability of the economic dimension refers to the whole range of activities pertaining
to a business’ sales, profits, cash flow or number of jobs created. The environment
dimension refers to the air or water quality, the (cost-) effective use of energy, the recycling
or reuse of waste produced by production processes. The social aspects pertain mainly to
the rights of employees, the impact of supplied products and services on the local
community, the safety of production processes, good practices in the workplace, labour
protection etc. (Martin, Shouten, 2012; Savitz, Weber, 2006; Osoian, Zaharie, 2010). The
concept of sustainable development is still subject to a constant revision (Clarke, 1997)
while researchers are more and more concerned with the need to address it (Muhibudin,
Mohamed, 2012).
2. Sustainable development in tourism
2.1 General aspects
The application of the concept of sustainable development to tourist businesses has some
major characteristics determined by the forms and types of business conducted in this field
of activity and by the various effects of the companies’ actions on the environment.
Although sometimes it is difficult, even impossible, to measure the impact of a tourist
business on the environment, the adverse effects of an unsustainable economic activity may
cause tourism to disappear from a particular area or diminish drastically in importance
(Hobson, Essex, 2001). The heavy pollution of a beach area or the lack of a unitary,
pleasant architecture may have tourists change their preference for a particular destination,

regardless of the reason for visitation (Stanciulescu, Ţîrcă, 2010). Both the management of
tourist companies (agencies, tour-operators, accommodation and food service units,
transporters etc.) and the representatives of local authorities may happen to face a range of
major environment problems such as the lack of a clear strategic vision for the harmonious
and integrated promotion and development of the resort, the lack of coordinated
involvement by all tourist actors in developing and implementing in a controlled way a
sustainable strategy in the area, the increasing quantities of waste and waste water
generated by local tourist businesses, the lack of an energy-effective transshipment between
train stations or air terminals, increased energy consumption, limited possibilities to reuse
package, the impossibility to purchase local products to support producers in the area etc.
(Persic-Zivadinov, 2009).
The contribution of sustainable development of a tourist business to the creation of a
competitive advantage is also underlined by Pavia et al. (2013). The authors’ conclusion, at
least for the region under analysis, is that there is no development of a tourist offer without
a careful focus on ensuring the quality of the tourist products and services, a fundamental
restructuring of the businesses in the area (infrastructure renewal and improvement,
repositioning local tourist businesses according to customer profile, integration of hotel
units into internationally recognized hotel chains etc.), making use of new forms of tourism
(ecotourism, cultural tourism, niche programs for clearly defined tourist segments, tourist
holiday programs etc.) or the sustained promotion of a tourist destination integrated into a
unitary vision.
The relevance of preserving the natural resources correlated with ensuring the social
balance of tourist destinations represents a real strategic driver for international and
national sustainable development. This is admitted by many organizations, associations and
institutions operating in the field of international tourism which bring their contribution to
upholding the efforts of local and national authorities, and by tourism business
representatives who admit their activities exert an impact on the environment and lead to
degradation of infrastructure in the area. Mention must be made that these efforts are
largely appreciated and properly upheld by the public (Dorobantu, Nistoreanu, 2012).
2.2 From the perspective of society and of local and national authorities
There is no fostering of sustainable tourism within various tourist destinations without
appropriate legislation (Morgera, 2010) that should regulate a number of specific factors
such as investments into the preservation of biodiversity and the promotion of sustainable
local businesses, the integrated approach to ecosystems, protection of local communities
from the negative effects of discrimination and/or marginalization, the harmonious
preservation and upholding of local traditions and customs to be handed down to future
generations, reduction of waste and pollution, decrease of social risks and of the rush for
resources, supporting opportunities for future generations with a view to increasing their
employment in the local communities etc. (Neamtu, 2012). Additionally, it is necessary to
lay down application rules, levy penalties and fines, pursue consistently and earnestly the
implementation proper of restrictive measures and punish the culpable (Nedelea, Dolpischi,
2004).
An issue that local communities deem relevant is the actual measuring of sustainable
development (Pelău et al., 2009). A relatively ample piece of research was conducted by
following factors: environment (number of parks, special protection areas), related
legislation (rules issued by national authorities and professional associations), quantitative
assessment of the impact on the environment (the cost-benefit analysis, the environment
audit, planning of resource exploitation), tourists management (tourists flow, transportation
restrictions etc.), indicators of the area’s carrying capacity (the maximum capacity of
tourists, the speed of resource regeneration, the level of noise pollution etc.), the public
consultation (through questionnaires or other survey techniques), ethical principles applied
by all actors in the area and the sustainability indicators (use of resources, access to tourist
facilities, local production, nature or culture diversity etc.).
A particular area may benefit from the positive contribution of sustainable development
expressed through the economic component (improving the transportation system, refitting
infrastructure, increase of the inhabitants’ income, strengthening urban security, increase of
employment and the living standard, using local infrastructure for cultural, sports etc.
events) on condition that public policy-makers develop an action plan with carefully
defined objectives, support local initiatives and tourist businesses to attract more tourists,
and make sustained investments in the promotion of tourism at the national, supranational
and international level (Akpan, Obang, 2012).
2.3 The management perspective
The successful implementation on a tourist business of a sustainable development-oriented
strategic vision depends largely on the policy-makers’ capacity to adjust substantially the
mundane realities, the market signals, the attitude or behaviour changes, and the customers’
desires and preferences (Berry, Ladkin, 1997).
Initiatives on the sustainability of tourist accommodation businesses have long ceased to be
something of a novelty as they are increasingly used by the management of big hotel chains
as strategic vector for promoting and supporting their own visions. The enforcement of
ethical standards on daily activities has been recognized in the case of Marriott
International which, in 2013, was awarded the prize “the World’s Most Ethical Company”
by Etisphere Institute (Marriott, 2013). Within its activities fostering the sustainable and
long-term development of the business, Marriott performs actions directed towards its own
employees (training courses on citizens’ rights and child protection, vocational retraining,
qualification and re-qualification of employees through programs conducted in various
fields—maintenance, cooking, cleaning, check-in etc.), ensuring that a significant number
of attendees are women. Another way that the Marriott chain understands sustainability is
developing offers for customers exhibiting unusual sexual orientations. Marriott
International was the first hotel chain that launched in 2012 a website exclusively for the
LGBT community, available in several languages (Marriott LGBT, 2013). The company
also directs its offers towards Afro-American, Hispanic or European tourists. The
company’s social actions also included numerous sponsorships, fund raising, fostering the
development of local communities or participating voluntarily to their actions, creating new
jobs. By building new hotels in countries such as Haiti, Peru or Rwanda, Marriott’s
management believes that this action will stimulate the national economy and attract quite a
large number of tourists towards these destinations. Within its environment-oriented policy,
Marriott pursues a drop of 20% in the consumption of energy and water by the end of 2020,
the building of eco-efficient hotels, signing partnerships with suppliers that, in like manner,
pursue a sustainable development strategy, proper training of employees and tourists with a
view to preserving the available resources, the consistent implementation of environment
protection actions (Marriott, 2013).
Other international hotel chains have also undertook similar sustainable development
initiatives. The Accor chain, for example, has defined seven strategic pillars for sustainable
development: healthy products and services, preservation of nature, reduction of carbon
emissions, continuous innovation, orientation towards local communities, dialogue with
customers and care for employees (Accor, 2011). On the other hand, Best Western attempts
to infuse an eco-friendly orientation into all its locations (energy production from
geothermal or solar resources, using recycled paper or ink from vegetable oils, equipping
hotel bathrooms with low pressure shower heads, composting food waste, signing
partnerships with suppliers that meet the standards of sustainable development etc.) (Best
Western Hotels, 2013).
Decentralized management and sustainable development were the two principles
successfully implemented by the new manager of the European group Scandic Hotels in the
mid-1990s of the last century (Goodman, 2000). The severe decline experienced by the
company demanded a change of the leadership vision. The new CEO, Roland Nilsson,
believed that the company’s sustained and lasting development was only achievable if it
exhibited a better customer, employee and environment orientation. Thus, the manager
adopted a new leadership philosophy/policy focused on fostering direct interaction between
the personnel of hotels and customers, as these have become the main driver for turning
into practice the responsibility towards the environment. In fact, Nilsson realizes quite early
that the loyalty of tourist customers may be increased by developing an emotional
relationship with them, particularly in relation to a common goal—the environment
protection. In his opinion, environment protection pertains to energy efficiency, reduced
consumption of drinking water, increasing the number of energy-saving bulbs, equipping
rooms with temperature monitoring systems, avoiding the use of chlorine to disinfect
bedclothes lest nature be heavily affected by the washing process, replacing solid soap with
liquid soap, which reduces drastically the amount of partially-used soap that previously was
thrown away etc. Through its own training school, the Scandic Hotels chain implemented
the “dialogue on the environment” program within which employees were trained to
contribute to the common goal of achieving a better environment. Additionally, the
company also implemented a program for environment innovation in collaboration with the
supply-chain partners (Goodman, 2000).
Naturally, not all examples in the literature reveal positive effects of sustainable
development in tourism. The primary research conducted by Hobson and Essex (2001)
within the management of tourist accommodation units reveals a low degree of
understanding and implementation of the concept of sustainable development within tourist
businesses of Plymouth UK as well as low usage of such practices. A possible problem
identified by the study is the way in which managers of these units define and understand
the concept of sustainable development. In many cases, managers identify the said concept
with the preservation of the tourist sector than with a focus on social, economic and
environment aspects that contribute to the welfare of the future generations.
Another study by Quintano et al (2011) conducted on managers of tourist accommodation
units shows that although managers are aware of the need to implement the principles of
sustainable development on their activities, they either fail to provide pertinent answers or
this regard. In other words, although accepting the need to implement sustainability,
managers are less knowledgeable about the actual ways of implementing the dimensions of
sustainability on their own businesses. The authors conclude that managers should be better
educated and/or informed about the significance and implications of sustainable
development so that they may merge sustainability actions into daily activities.
A similar situation was signaled by a study conducted on managers of some Croatian
hotels. The conclusions thereof explicitly indicate that the principles of business
sustainability are wrongly applied, waste reuse or recycling is only implemented when
public subsidies are received, energy efficiency is insufficiently applied, more or less toxic
substances are often used to clean or wash linen, laundry etc., and renewable energy
sources are used to a very low extent (Persic-Zivadinov, Blazevik, 2010).
2.4 Consumers’ perspective
Sustainable development in tourism is an asset not only of public authorities (national,
regional or local) and tourist business representatives (accommodation, food and transport
units), but also of consumers. Tourists must know and understand the principles of
sustainability, adjust their behaviour, preferences, consumption habits or attitudes to the
norms and rules applicable in tourism, and pay due attention to the dimensions of
sustainability. Additionally, they may perform an objective assessment of sustainability
actions conducted by authorities or the actors in tourism industry, issuing relevant opinions
or proposing means to improve the activities underway (Dinu et al., 2012).
Therefore, marketing has a very important role to play in informing, teaching and making
tourists aware of the sustainable behaviour that they must exhibit when they visit a business
or leisure destination and when they get in touch with a representative of the tourism
industry. Recent studies show that a highly significant percentage of Europeans are
concerned with the environment protection and with an active involvement in sustainability
actions, even though they do not fully appreciate the significance of the concept. They also
expect enterprises to show increased responsibility towards environment and/or societyoriented actions, that is, sustainable development (Martin, Schouten, 2012).
The consumption of tourist products becomes sustainable only to the extent that the concept
of sustainability is properly understood, pursued and put into practice by tourists (Danciu,
2013). Tourist business operators search for the optimal and useful way to advertise their
own products and services, showing customers how they can obtain sustainability through
consumption (Pop et al., 2012). The challenge is even greater as such products and services
are sold at an premium price, thus entailing bigger efforts to support them and show the
customers the advantages they can obtain (high standard cleanliness, exclusivity, getting
priority in the provision of products and services, customized services, etc.).
The management of one’s own business in compliance with the principles of sustainable
development by increasing responsibility towards some environment issues (reducing the
quantity of waste, streamlining a hotel’s water or energy consumption etc.) may lead to an
increase of the number of tourist arrivals (Hobson, Essex, 2001). Tourists are likely to
choose those destinations where the local actors (accommodation and/or food units,
entertainment units etc.) promote and support actions and activities that contribute to the

development of a sustainable environment (environment protection, social responsibility
etc.).
3. Research objectives and methodology
The main goal of the current research is to investigate how the three dimensions of
sustainable development—the orientation towards environment protection, orientation
towards society and the economic component—peculiar to hospitality businesses are
perceived by the consumers of these services, namely, the tourists. To this effect, the
authors have researched into the effect of these three dimensions on the customers’
satisfaction with the products and services of two, three and four-star hotels and
guesthouses in a big city of Romania. The empirical model tested by the authors is
presented in Figure 1.

Figure no. 1. The proposed analysis model
The literature (Danciu, 2013) indicates the possibility to analyze satisfaction with the
sustainable development actions. This is all the more interesting in the case of the
Romanian hospitality industry as the research findings point to relevant and representative
management decisions that can be made with respect to the objectives and strategies
adopted by tourist business operators. The scarcity of empirical studies on the
operationalization (turning theoretical concepts into statements able to be assessed by
tourists) of dimensions of sustainable development in tourism business (orientation towards
economy, society and the environment protection) prompted the authors to search for
studies already validated in other fields of activity. The operationalization proper based on
the said studies is presented in Table 1.
Following their operationalization, the dimensions of sustainable development as well as
satisfaction were integrated into a questionnaire as statements of a five-point Likert scale
(total agreement—total disagreement). As experimental research, the questionnaire was
administered through the survey technique on tourists who booked into two, three or fourstar hotels and guesthouses. The managers of the accommodation units were contacted to
facilitate the implementation of the research, while tourists were approached in public
spaces.

2000; Yun, Good, 2007.
Out of over 1,000 collected questionnaires, only 850 could be validated. Through these,
120 guesthouses and 730 hotels were evaluated. As the precise categorization of tourists
was unknown, a sampling plan proper could not be developed. However, to ensure
representativeness, the survey included individuals of either sex, domestic and foreign
tourists, and tourists who travel for business or pleasure. Thus, almost 15% of the
interviewed foreign tourists were Italians, Germans, British, Hungarians or French, 50.6%
were men and 49.4% were women, respectively. 28.4% of respondents spend one night at
the investigated units, most of whom preferring the three-star units (119 individuals). A
two-night stay is preferred by 211 tourists (24.8% of the overall sample) for business
purposes in four-star hotels and by 155 tourists in three-star hotels. Tourists prefer almost
equally the three-star hotels (81 individuals) and four-star hotels (83 individuals) for stays
longer than three nights, enjoyed almost exclusively for private purposes.
Following their collection, the answers were introduced into SPSS and subject to tests in
order to check their correctness, reliability and internal consistency. To this effect, the
authors made use of the Cronbach’s alpha coefficient (α >0.7), the “item-to-total”
correlation, the KMO criterion (> 0.7), Bartlett’s test of sphericity for the exploratory factor
analysis conducted for the three dimensions presented in Table 1 and for satisfaction
(Churchill, 1991; Dabija, 2010). To ascertain the model’s reliability and predictive
performance, we could also have appealed to the ROC curve (Dragos, 2010). This tool was
abandoned, however, because of the mismatch between the causal relationships among
variables and their typology. The obtained results presented in Table two indicate that the
statements feature a high level of fit and consistency. A seven-item scale was initially
applied to the dimension “orientation toward society”. As the value of the alpha coefficient
was found to increase by the removal of two statements (concern with creating jobs and
with purchasing local brands), these statements were no longer used. As Table 2 shows, the
fit indices recorded a slight improvement.

Analyzed individually, the dimensions of sustainable development turned out to be stable.
Therefore, they were integrated into a single exploratory factor analysis, using oblique
rotation, a method peculiar to exploratory empirical research (Walsh, Beatty, 2007). This
time, too, the resulted indices exhibited increased fit (KMO = 0.943, χ2 = 10937.627****;
df = 420; Eigenvalues 6.018 / 3.682 / 1.312). Consequently, all dimensions presented in
Figure 1 were subject to structural equations modelling in AMOS 20.0. The model’s fit was
confirmed as quite high values were obtained for the indices GFI, AGFI, TLI, NLI, CFI >
0.8, SRMR > 0.8 (Standardized Root Mean Square Residual) and RMSEA > 0.8 (Forza,
Filippini, 1998; Ju et al., 2006; Dabija, 2010).
4. Research findings
4.1 The general model
As for the overall sample, it was ascertained that all fit indices highlighted by the literature
exceed the minimum threshold levels (see Table 3).

The above data allow us to validate the proposed empirical model (Figure 1) and set to
interpret the findings. One of the first aspects to highlight is respondents’ delineation of the
three dimensions of sustainable development—social/societal orientation (SO),
environment orientation (EN) and the economic orientation (EC)—and their combined
contribution to building satisfaction. The greatest influence was noticed with the economic
component (0.425***). The result is not surprising because the above elements mirror the
management’s great concern for conducting activities that turn the business into a success,
upon which equally depends tourists’ satisfaction.
The social dimension of sustainable development influences to a lesser degree the
satisfaction felt by tourists (0.130*). This may be accounted for by tourists’ being less
interested in these issues, viewing them irrelevant in building satisfaction, or by the low
involvement of hotels and guesthouses in the life of the local communities or do not
promote active participation in these projects. Policy-makers are expected to pay increased
attention in the future to the social component of sustainable development—coordination or
co-organization of charitable events, participation in and/or sponsoring cultural activities,
involvement in the life of the local community (employment opportunities, local initiatives,
cooperation with local producers, etc.).
The environment protection is the most visible dimension and the easiest to perceive and
understand (0.221**) as it stands for the head of the concept of sustainable development.
Hotel rooms are usually equipped with information materials which express the hotel’s
intention to protect the environment by changing towels, using package or products made
of recyclable materials, setting up water or soap-saving devices, using sources of renewable
energy etc. Some accommodation units take one step further by inviting their customers to
take part in this initiative so that they may contribute together to preserving the natural
resources. On the other hand, one of the most important trends among consumers
worldwide is the shift in their attitude toward the concept of sustainability, particularly
towards the environment protection. Reports of international bodies attest the Europeans’
concern about the environment protection issues (Martin, Shouten, 2012).
4.2 Research findings broken down by hotels versus guesthouses
The comparative research on hotels and guesthouses reveals different situations between
the two types of units (Table 4). The economic component of sustainable development is
more significant in the case of hotels (0.477****) but less relevant in the case of
guesthouses (0.413*). This is likely due to the fact that guesthouses are less successful in
developing and implementing consistent policies on the economic sustainability. As
indicated in Table 4, both the intensity and the significance of the impact of the social and
environment sustainability on satisfaction is neither important nor consistent in the case of
guesthouses and hotels, respectively.

Hotels most likely are constantly ready to properly display within their units the measures
pertaining to the charity events organized, the involvement in local or humanitarian
projects, creation of new jobs or hiring individuals from the community. However, the
somewhat low intensity of the connection (0.098**) leads to the conclusion that the
management of the analyzed units fails to properly impress upon tourists or communicate
to them in an integrated, synergic manner the actual actions that were performed. The
recommendation is that the social actions performed by hotels should be brought to the
public’s attention.
A totally different situation exists in the case of environment efforts targeting sustainable
development. These efforts have a great contribution in building tourists’ satisfaction
(0.275***). Informing tourists about the annual energy consumption coupled with the
efforts made to diminish it (for example, by equipping rooms with energy-saving bulbs) or
resorting to renewable resources may naturally generate satisfaction, particularly in visitors
who imbue their own actions with “green” overtones, in compliance with the principles of
the environment preservation.
4.3 Research findings according to star rating
The findings breakdown by star rating revealed a very interesting and representative
situation. First, all the model fit indices exceed the minimum threshold level (Table 5). In
the case of the two-star accommodation units, the impact of the economic and social
component lacks significance in generating the tourists’ satisfaction.

The findings indicate that either two-star tourist accommodation units do not perform local
community-oriented activities to streamline economic activity or fail to properly

building their satisfaction. It is only the impact of the environment measures (albeit of a
low intensity and significance) that tourists perceive to a certain extent (0.188*). We
believe that these units should pay increased attention to the measures aimed at social
involvement, reducing pollution, streamlining the energy consumption or using
environment friendly substances. It is also possible that the satisfaction of tourists who used
the services of these hotels might depend more on some measures taken by the management
(accommodation fee, characteristics of the hotel room, food services etc.) and less on those
that contribute to sustainable development in tourism (environment protection, social
involvement, efficient use of resources etc.).
The effect of the economic orientation on satisfaction is quite strong (0.450*) in the case of
the three-star accommodation units, which means tourists appreciate favourably their
economic and financial efforts. By comparison with the previous case, the impact of the
social and environment dimensions on satisfaction is much more intense and quite highly
significant. We believe tourists perceive properly the relevant efforts made by the
accommodation units in terms of social involvement, support of local initiatives or
involvement in co-organization of events.
The strongest and most significant effect of sustainable development components on
tourists’ satisfaction is far and away revealed by the four-star accommodation units. Unlike
the two or three-star units, the four-star units make sustained and consistent efforts to
inform guests on their involvement in local community-supporting activities, either by
promoting local brands or regional food, or by sponsoring various events. The management
of these units are constantly striving—naturally, for economic reasons as well (see the
Marriott case referred to at the beginning of the paper)—to reduce significantly the quantity
of package, the water consumption, and to use energy from renewable sources etc.
Conclusions
The current research clearly reveals that the aspects that support sustainable development
may also build tourists’ satisfaction with the accommodation units. Even if only
exploratory in nature, our endeavor needs further research and analysis by other authors to
reveal even more clearly how sustainable development may contribute not only to draw
individuals to a particular destination but also to build their satisfaction and loyalty. The
components of sustainable development may actually take the form of marketing stimuli for
the informed tourist who wishes to leave the future generation a lasting legacy, and become
elements generating competitive advantage, which contribute to differentiating products
and services and to attracting customers.
The findings breakdown by star rating showed that respondents are able to delineate
precisely the dimensions of sustainable development promoted by the units’ management.
The environment component was particularly stressed as it contributes to the generation of
satisfaction among the interviewed tourists. We believe that the management of four-star
hotels and guesthouses are the best in performing social, cultural and environment actions
within their regular activities and in informing the customers about such actions. Naturally,
the target segment of four-star hotels is likely to be more concerned with the sustainability
of the unit’s behaviour. Therefore, every related effort may contribute to increasing their
level of satisfaction. Tourists thus can create a clearer image of the unit in their mind and

bring their contribution in time to the unit’s better positioning on the market and to
pursuing a proper competitive strategy.
Clients of two-star hotels emphasize the fact that the units where they check into do not
take appropriate measures to increase their satisfaction by means of sustainable
development actions. One of the following two reasons may underlie this situation: tourists
are unaware of, or uninterested in the measures pertaining to sustainable development
(performing charitable actions, creating new jobs, supporting local initiatives, protecting
the environment etc.) or managers are ignorant of the fact that by focusing on sustainability
they can generate competitive advantage and identify the appropriate ways of
differentiating their products and services.
Although the present scientific paper has its own important limitations, the authors believe
that this topic should be studied more thoroughly in the future through scientific research
that better investigates this phenomenon. In fact, an integrated piece of research should
have taken into account tourist consumers’ perception of sustainable development efforts
undertaken not only by one of the tourist operators (accommodation units) but also by other
tourism representatives or the local, regional or national authorities. The difficulty of
implementing a theoretical model of this kind lies, on the one hand, in the scarcity of
similar studies aimed at analyzing these aspects and, on the other hand, in failing to
determine easily the precise components that should, or can be, analyzed. We believe,
however, that there is increased potential for further research in this field.
Last but not least, the model could also have taken into account the policy-makers’
(managers’) perception of the analyzed dimensions. This would have established a
comparative correlation between the opinions and perceptions of those who know and work
in the sector (managers) and of those who evaluate the sector (tourists).
