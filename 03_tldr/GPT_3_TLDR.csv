Test Abstract 1 - Generation 1,"The risk of drought-induced tree mortality has not been quantified, but the magnitude of the issue is likely to be significant."
Test Abstract 1 - Generation 2,"Greenhouse gas emissions have significantly altered global climate, and will continue to do so in the future. Increases in the frequency, duration, or severity of drought and heat stress associated with climate change could profoundly alter the composition, structure, and biogeography"
Test Abstract 1 - Generation 3,Existing projections of tree mortality are based on models that lack functionally realistic mortality mechanisms.
Test Abstract 1 - Generation 4,"Greenhouse gas emissions have significantly altered global climate, and will continue to do so in the future."
Test Abstract 1 - Generation 5,"Tree mortality due to increased drought and heat stress is likely to increase in many regions, but not all."
Test Abstract 2 - Generation 1,"The most complex and nonlinear forest-atmosphere feedbacks can be dampened or amplified by tropical, temperate and boreal reforestation and afforestation."
Test Abstract 2 - Generation 2,Forests are under tremendous pressure from global change. Interdisciplinary science that integrates knowledge of the many interacting climate services of forests with the impacts of global change is necessary to identify and understand as yet unexplored feedbacks in the Earth system and potential to mitigate
Test Abstract 2 - Generation 3,Forests are under tremendous pressure from global change. Interdisciplinary science that integrates knowledge of the many interacting climate services of forests with the impacts of global change is necessary to identify and understand as yet unexplored feedbacks in the Earth system and potential for forests
Test Abstract 2 - Generation 4,The forests influence climate by dampening or amplifying anthropogenic climate change.
Test Abstract 2 - Generation 5,Forests are under tremendous pressure from global change. Interdisciplinary science that integrates knowledge of the many interacting climate services of forests with the impacts of global change is necessary to identify and understand as yet unexplored feedbacks in the Earth system and the potential of
Test Abstract 3 - Generation 1,The paper presents current knowledge about the impact of livestock sector on climate change. The main sources of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from livestock are described and the contribution of livestock sector to the global GHG emissions is presented on the basis of latest results
Test Abstract 3 - Generation 2,The current knowledge about the impact of livestock sector on climate change is summarized and a general overview of an emergent environmental issue such as the impact of livestock sector on climate change is provided.
Test Abstract 3 - Generation 3,Livestock sector contributes to the global warming.
Test Abstract 3 - Generation 4,The paper documents the impact of livestock on climate change and provides a general overview of an emerging environmental issue.
Test Abstract 3 - Generation 5,The paper summarises the current knowledge about the impact of livestock sector on climate change. The main sources of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from livestock are described and the contribution of livestock sector to the global GHG emissions is presented on the basis of
Test Abstract 4 - Generation 1,"Using climate models, the authors estimate that in temperate and tropical regions, yield changes are expected to be 0.3–2% per year by 2050."
Test Abstract 4 - Generation 2,Feeding a growing global population in a changing climate presents a significant challenge to society.
Test Abstract 4 - Generation 3,"The combined impacts of climate change and adaptation are expected to increase yields by an average of 7–15% in temperate regions, but will not be sufficient for all crop varieties."
Test Abstract 4 - Generation 4,"Using projections of future climate, the authors predict that if greenhouse gases continue to increase, 15-37% of crops and livestock will be committed to extinction."
Test Abstract 4 - Generation 5,"Climate change predictions are confirmed by the collective increase in crop yields, and projections of climate-induced changes in productivity."
Test Abstract 5 - Generation 1,"Climate change impacts on biodiversity are increasingly well documented. In this Review, we summarize different approaches used for assessing species' vulnerability to climate change. We describe three main methods used to derive these currencies (correlative, mechanistic and trait-based), and"
Test Abstract 5 - Generation 2,Climate change is the main driver of biodiversity loss
Test Abstract 5 - Generation 3,"To minimize biodiversity losses, conservationists need to identify species that are likely to be most vulnerable to shifts in climate."
Test Abstract 5 - Generation 4,"Climate change predictions are confirmed by the collective changes in distribution of species, and the climate-change impacts on biodiversity."
Test Abstract 5 - Generation 5,"Climate change impacts on biodiversity are increasingly well documented, and many methods have been developed to assess species' vulnerability to climatic changes. To minimize global biodiversity losses, conservationists need to identify those species that are likely to be most vulnerable to the impacts of"
