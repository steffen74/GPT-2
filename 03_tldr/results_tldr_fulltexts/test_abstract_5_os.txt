Abstract:
Causal attribution of recent biological trends to climate change is complicated because non-climatic influences dominate local, short-term biological changes. Any underlying signal from climate change is likely to be revealed by analyses that seek systematic trends across diverse species and geographic regions; however, debates within the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reveal several definitions of a ‘systematic trend’. Here, we explore these differences, apply diverse analyses to more than 1,700 species, and show that recent biological trends match climate change predictions. Global meta-analyses documented significant range shifts averaging 6.1 km per decade towards the poles (or metres per decade upward), and significant mean advancement of spring events by 2.3 days per decade. We define a diagnostic fingerprint of temporal and spatial ‘sign-switching’ responses uniquely predicted by twentieth century climate trends. Among appropriate long-term/large-scale/multi-species data sets, this diagnostic fingerprint was found for 279 species. This suite of analyses generates ‘very high confidence’ (as laid down by the IPCC) that climate change is already affecting living systems.
TL;DR:
Climate change predictions are confirmed by the collective change in distribution of species, and the change in timing of biological events.

Abstract:
The effects of climate change on biodiversity are increasingly well documented, and many methods have been developed to assess species' vulnerability to climatic changes, both ongoing and projected in the coming decades. To minimize global biodiversity losses, conservationists need to identify those species that are likely to be most vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. In this Review, we summarize different currencies used for assessing species' climate change vulnerability. We describe three main approaches used to derive these currencies (correlative, mechanistic and trait-based), and their associated data requirements, spatial and temporal scales of application and modelling methods. We identify strengths and weaknesses of the approaches and highlight the sources of uncertainty inherent in each method that limit projection reliability. Finally, we provide guidance for conservation practitioners in selecting the most appropriate approach(es) for their planning needs and highlight priority areas for further assessments.
TL;DR:
The climate change hypothesis is not well understood and is poorly validated. Many models rely on a single set of climate variables for their assessment (e.g., Sustainability, Sustainability Scorecard, etc.), while many different models incorporate many different aspects of climate variability (e.g., Sustainability Scorecard, etc.). The paper has several flaws, and some of the data is not robust enough to be used in a general framework. However, we suggest that future research should address thes

TL;DR:
The paper is structured as follows: we present a comprehensive description of the proposed models and their dependencies, and then we review their application in a conceptual framework. We present the main findings, the proposed empirical data sets, and the empirical results, respectively. Then, we perform a meta-analysis to assess whether climate change impacts are likely to be amplified by more stringent methods or more stringent methods. Our main conclusion is that the climate change models are, in many respects, too good to be used for assessin
