Abstract:
Causal attribution of recent biological trends to climate change is complicated because non-climatic influences dominate local, short-term biological changes. Any underlying signal from climate change is likely to be revealed by analyses that seek systematic trends across diverse species and geographic regions; however, debates within the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reveal several definitions of a ‘systematic trend’. Here, we explore these differences, apply diverse analyses to more than 1,700 species, and show that recent biological trends match climate change predictions. Global meta-analyses documented significant range shifts averaging 6.1 km per decade towards the poles (or metres per decade upward), and significant mean advancement of spring events by 2.3 days per decade. We define a diagnostic fingerprint of temporal and spatial ‘sign-switching’ responses uniquely predicted by twentieth century climate trends. Among appropriate long-term/large-scale/multi-species data sets, this diagnostic fingerprint was found for 279 species. This suite of analyses generates ‘very high confidence’ (as laid down by the IPCC) that climate change is already affecting living systems.
TL;DR:
Climate change predictions are confirmed by the collective change in distribution of species, and the change in timing of biological events.

Abstract:
Feeding a growing global population in a changing climate presents a significant challenge to society. The projected yields of crops under a range of agricultural and climatic scenarios are needed to assess food security prospects. Previous meta-analyses have summarized climate change impacts and adaptive potential as a function of temperature, but have not examined uncertainty, the timing of impacts, or the quantitative effectiveness of adaptation. Here we develop a new data set of more than 1,700 published simulations to evaluate yield impacts of climate change and adaptation. Without adaptation, losses in aggregate production are expected for wheat, rice and maize in both temperate and tropical regions by 2 °C of local warming. Crop-level adaptations increase simulated yields by an average of 7–15%, with adaptations more effective for wheat and rice than maize. Yield losses are greater in magnitude for the second half of the century than for the first. Consensus on yield decreases in the second half of the century is stronger in tropical than temperate regions, yet even moderate warming may reduce temperate crop yields in many locations. Although less is known about interannual variability than mean yields, the available data indicate that increases in yield variability are likely.
TL;DR:
The climate change process is complex, and it requires complex data sets to be comprehensible. The scientific literature on climate change is rife with articles and papers that describe how changes in the climate system affect crop production, yield, and ecosystem services (e.g., [1–4]). Yet little attention is paid to the impact of changes in climate on agricultural production, for example, [5–9]. Thus, it is crucial to systematically examine the mechanisms underlying these complex interactions. Our paper addresses thes

TL;DR:
The recent scientific literature has been dominated by a mix of theoretical and empirical evidence that shifts in climate change are accelerating. In particular, empirical research has focused on the link between increases in temperature and increases in crop yield. This article examines recent climate-change effects on crop yield and discusses how they may change over time. We present estimates of the link between changes in temperature and crop yield that are more closely related to changes in climate. In particular, we use a multi-model stochastic model t

‘Climate change impacts are amplified by the persistence of insufficient agricultural land and water availability. The projected yield of crops under a given climate scenario is needed to assess food security prospects. Past studies have used the same crop yield as a proxy for climate change to compare the effect of climate change and herbicide use on yield. This new set of empirical data sets provides a clearer picture of how long-term spatial and temporal variability of crop yield influences the timing of crop yield changes. We apply the proposed interpretatio
