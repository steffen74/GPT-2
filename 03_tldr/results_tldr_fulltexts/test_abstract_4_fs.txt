Abstract:
Causal attribution of recent biological trends to climate change is complicated because non-climatic influences dominate local, short-term biological changes. Any underlying signal from climate change is likely to be revealed by analyses that seek systematic trends across diverse species and geographic regions; however, debates within the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reveal several definitions of a ‘systematic trend’. Here, we explore these differences, apply diverse analyses to more than 1,700 species, and show that recent biological trends match climate change predictions. Global meta-analyses documented significant range shifts averaging 6.1 km per decade towards the poles (or metres per decade upward), and significant mean advancement of spring events by 2.3 days per decade. We define a diagnostic fingerprint of temporal and spatial ‘sign-switching’ responses uniquely predicted by twentieth century climate trends. Among appropriate long-term/large-scale/multi-species data sets, this diagnostic fingerprint was found for 279 species. This suite of analyses generates ‘very high confidence’ (as laid down by the IPCC) that climate change is already affecting living systems.
TL;DR:
Climate change predictions are confirmed by the collective change in distribution of species, and the change in timing of biological events.

Abstract:
Significantly more carbon is stored in the world's soils—including peatlands, wetlands and permafrost—than is present in the atmosphere. Disagreement exists, however, regarding the effects of climate change on global soil carbon stocks. If carbon stored belowground is transferred to the atmosphere by a warming-induced acceleration of its decomposition, a positive feedback to climate change would occur. Conversely, if increases of plant-derived carbon inputs to soils exceed increases in decomposition, the feedback would be negative. Despite much research, a consensus has not yet emerged on the temperature sensitivity of soil carbon decomposition. Unravelling the feedback effect is particularly difficult, because the diverse soil organic compounds exhibit a wide range of kinetic properties, which determine the intrinsic temperature sensitivity of their decomposition. Moreover, several environmental constraints obscure the intrinsic temperature sensitivity of substrate decomposition, causing lower observed ‘apparent’ temperature sensitivity, and these constraints may, themselves, be sensitive to climate.
TL;DR:
Soil carbon decomposition may be sensitive to climate, but the amount of decomposition is constrained by other factors.

Abstract:
Feeding a growing global population in a changing climate presents a significant challenge to society. The projected yields of crops under a range of agricultural and climatic scenarios are needed to assess food security prospects. Previous meta-analyses have summarized climate change impacts and adaptive potential as a function of temperature, but have not examined uncertainty, the timing of impacts, or the quantitative effectiveness of adaptation. Here we develop a new data set of more than 1,700 published simulations to evaluate yield impacts of climate change and adaptation. Without adaptation, losses in aggregate production are expected for wheat, rice and maize in both temperate and tropical regions by 2 °C of local warming. Crop-level adaptations increase simulated yields by an average of 7–15%, with adaptations more effective for wheat and rice than maize. Yield losses are greater in magnitude for the second half of the century than for the first. Consensus on yield decreases in the second half of the century is stronger in tropical than temperate regions, yet even moderate warming may reduce temperate crop yields in many locations. Although less is known about interannual variability than mean yields, the available data indicate that increases in yield variability are likely.
TL;DR:
‘Climate change impacts are hard to quantify, but yield changes are difficult to quantify. The proposed dataset is designed to capture yield changes in both spatial and temporal contexts. In this way, estimates of the temporal context of climate change are obtained through a multi-stakeholder approach, such as cross-country comparisons. In particular, this approach requires that the spatial and temporal spatial data be spatially and spatially spatially constrained. However, the proposed dataset also requires that the spatial data be spa

‘Climate change impacts are expected to be stronger in temperate and tropical regions than in the second half of the century. Yields in these regions may be higher than in the first half, but the benefits of adaptation are lessened by climate change. This paper has several limitations. First, it does not account for the different spatial/temporal distributions of adaptation across regions. The spatial/temporal distributions of climate change responses are highly variable, and their spatial distribution is often hard to interpre

‘Climate change impacts are complex and involve multiple variables, including climate change, crop yield, changes in climatic regimes, and changes in agricultural production systems. There is insufficient systematic literature on such complex and diverse data sets to characterize their impact on agricultural yield.

The present paper is the first attempt to quantify the effect of climate change on yield, and to identify possible adaptive mechanisms. We test th
