Abstract:
Causal attribution of recent biological trends to climate change is complicated because non-climatic influences dominate local, short-term biological changes. Any underlying signal from climate change is likely to be revealed by analyses that seek systematic trends across diverse species and geographic regions; however, debates within the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reveal several definitions of a ‘systematic trend’. Here, we explore these differences, apply diverse analyses to more than 1,700 species, and show that recent biological trends match climate change predictions. Global meta-analyses documented significant range shifts averaging 6.1 km per decade towards the poles (or metres per decade upward), and significant mean advancement of spring events by 2.3 days per decade. We define a diagnostic fingerprint of temporal and spatial ‘sign-switching’ responses uniquely predicted by twentieth century climate trends. Among appropriate long-term/large-scale/multi-species data sets, this diagnostic fingerprint was found for 279 species. This suite of analyses generates ‘very high confidence’ (as laid down by the IPCC) that climate change is already affecting living systems.
TL;DR:
Climate change predictions are confirmed by the collective change in distribution of species, and the change in timing of biological events.

Abstract:
The world's forests influence climate through physical, chemical, and biological processes that affect planetary energetics, the hydrologic cycle, and atmospheric composition. These complex and nonlinear forest-atmosphere interactions can dampen or amplify anthropogenic climate change. Tropical, temperate, and boreal reforestation and afforestation attenuate global warming through carbon sequestration. Biogeophysical feedbacks can enhance or diminish this negative climate forcing. Tropical forests mitigate warming through evaporative cooling, but the low albedo of boreal forests is a positive climate forcing. The evaporative effect of temperate forests is unclear. The net climate forcing from these and other processes is not known. Forests are under tremendous pressure from global change. Interdisciplinary science that integrates knowledge of the many interacting climate services of forests with the impacts of global change is necessary to identify and understand as yet unexplored feedbacks in the Earth system and the potential of forests to mitigate climate change.
TL;DR:
The climate change process can have multiple drivers and consequences, but the most important one is the feedback mechanism that modulates the planetary energetics. This paper provides a comprehensive review of recent literature on the relationship between climate change and ecosystem resilience and suggests a novel tool for understanding this relationship. It also provides a framework for future research on how this mechanism may play out across different parts of the Earth system and across different sub-systems. The paper also highlights the importance of interdisciplinary research to advance understandin

TL;DR:
The paper focuses on the contribution of ecosystems to global warming and its relationship to climate change. This is a preliminary step in understanding the mechanisms of climate change and its relationship to ecosystem services. The paper then develops and tests the hypothesis that ecosystem services play an important role in mitigating climate change. The paper then concludes that the role of ecosystems in mitigating climate change is poorly understood. Future research needs to identify the mechanisms of climate change and its interactions with ecosystem services. The paper concludes that the proposed mechanisms of climat

TL;DR:
‘A truly global system is likely to exhibit extreme weather events, drought, and flooding. These events, exacerbated by the global warming, may exacerbate regional or global food shortages, displacing cities and towns and forcing the spread of diseases and more widespread infectious diseases.‘(Pfeiffer, 1998, p. 12)Climate change may exacerbate these events, but the mechanisms that cause them are not well understood. The mechanisms by which climate change may exacerbate these events are not well understood

The paper draws on the literature on climate change to explore the complex interplay of the human-environmental and natural-resource interactions on climate. The paper concludes that the current literature on climate change is incomplete because of the absence of a well-defined, spatially and spatially spanning interlocking influence on the natural-resource environment of the human-environmental and natural-resource interactions.
