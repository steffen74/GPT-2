"Test Abstract 1 - Generation 1				";Climate change predictions are confirmed by the collective change in distribution of species, and the change in timing of biological events.;The present paper presents the first empirical assessment of the effects of climate change on biomass consumption and greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions from biomass production in Uganda. The analysis of the results indicates that GHG emissions are positively correlated with biomass consumption, but positively correlated with greenhouse gases (GHG) emissions. The results also indicate that biomass consumption increases GHG emissions, but decreases GHG emissions. This is important because GHG emissions are a major component of energy consumption. Further, this paper examines th;;;
"Test Abstract 1 - Generation 2				";Drought is not a serious threat to the world's forests but it is a significant contributor to the current state of affairs. Therefore, the international community must ensure that future climate-related threats do not exacerbate existing ecological and social problems.;A global awareness of the impact of climate change on the environment is necessary. However, despite the fact that nearly half of the world's population lives in extreme poverty and climate-related disasters, the planet's carbon dioxide concentration is still below the level considered necessary for human survival.
