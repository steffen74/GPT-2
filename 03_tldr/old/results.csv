Test Abstract 4 - Generation 1;;;The climate change process is complex, and it requires complex data sets to be comprehensible. The scientific literature on climate change is rife with articles and papers that describe how changes in the climate system affect crop production, yield, and ecosystem services (e.g., [1–4]). Yet little attention is paid to the impact of changes in climate on agricultural production, for example, [5–9]. Thus, it is crucial to systematically examine the mechanisms underlying these complex interactions. Our paper addresses thes;‘Climate change impacts are hard to quantify, but yield changes are difficult to quantify. The proposed dataset is designed to capture yield changes in both spatial and temporal contexts. In this way, estimates of the temporal context of climate change are obtained through a multi-stakeholder approach, such as cross-country comparisons.

Test Abstract 4 - Generation 3;;;The recent scientific literature has been dominated by a mix of theoretical and empirical evidence that shifts in climate change are accelerating. In particular, empirical research has focused on the link between increases in temperature and increases in crop yield.

We present estimates of the link between changes in temperature and crop yield that are more closely related to changes in climate. In particular, we use a multi-model stochastic model t;‘Climate change impacts are expected to be stronger in temperate and tropical regions than in the second half of the century.

Test Abstract 4 - Generation 4;;;‘Climate change impacts are amplified by the persistence of insufficient agricultural land and water availability. The projected yield of crops under a given climate scenario is needed to assess food security prospects. Past studies have used the same crop yield as a proxy for climate change to compare the effect of climate change and herbicide use on yield. This new set of empirical data sets provides a clearer picture of how long-term spatial and temporal variability of crop yield influences the timing of crop yield changes. We apply the proposed interpretatio;‘Climate change impacts may be adaptive, but the timing of adaptation is constrained by other factors.’(1)(2)In this paper, we evaluate the relationship between crop yield and the degree of adaptation to climate change.
