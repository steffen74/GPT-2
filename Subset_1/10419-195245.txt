In the past few decades international trade has increased exponentially and
production fragmentation was one of the main causes. The fragmentation process,
referred as ‘‘trade in tasks’’ by Grossman and Rossi-Hansberg (2008), has led to an
increase in global integration, generating a web of economic interactions commonly
denoted as international production networks. In the beginning, this change
involved mostly trade among rich nations, but the real ‘‘revolution started when
supply chain trade gained importance among high-tech and low-wage nations
between 1985 and 1995’’ (Baldwin and Lopez-Gonzalez 2015). Production
fragmentation opened new possibilities of economic growth to developing
countries, allowing their engagement in the production process of manufactured
goods that they were not able to produce.
The expansion of production networks changed the rules of the economic
development game, facilitating developing countries’ access to networks, global
markets, capital, knowledge, and technology (OECD 2013). Previously, a country
had to climb every single step in the industrial development ladder, mastering all
production processes, to manufacture a given good. However, the advent of
production networks offered the possibility of skipping steps in the catch-up
procedure through the acquisition of knowledge and technology from third countries
and the specialization in one or few steps of the production process. Understanding
these changes and their consequent implications is crucial to draw policies that
integrate a country in this new production structure and allow it to explore the best
possibilities for guaranteeing sustainable economic growth and development.
The empirical literature about production fragmentation is very rich, with many
studies focusing on the regions where production fragmentation is more developed:
East Asia, the European Union, and North America.1 Although the demand is
growing for the analysis of the current situation and the effects that this new trend
can have on Latin America, the literature is still incipient.
A few papers provide some information about the status of production
fragmentation in Latin America based on descriptive analysis. Aminian et al.
(2009) compared the economic integration process in East Asia and Latin America,
analyzing the characteristics and intensity of intra-bloc and inter-bloc trade. They
used a revealed comparative advantage (RCA) index to identify the share of traded
manufacture parts and components with comparative advantage in the intra-bloc
trade. Curran and Zignago (2013) studied the regionalization of trade in South
America from 1994 to 2007, differentiating the trade ﬂows by the end use of the
products and the level of embodied technology. They concluded that the trade
agreements have not extensively affected the regional trade level and that trade of
intermediate products was still very low, indicating that regional production
networks were still under-developed. Calfat et al. (2011) investigated the
participation of Argentina, Brazil, Guatemala, and Nicaragua in fragmented world

participation in fragmented production. Fung et al. (2015a) used manufacturing
trade data, classiﬁed according to the Standard International Trade Classiﬁcation
(SITC), to compare production sharing in Latin America, North America, and East
Asia from 1985 to 2006. They identiﬁed the existence of a relatively thick
production network involving the trade of parts of motor vehicles, telecommunication equipment, and electronic components. However, it was concentrated on
Mexico’s trade with US and Canada, while Brazil also played a smaller role. Fung
et al. (2015b) used the same data and methodology to compare Brazil, China, and
Mexico’s participation in production networks. They analyzed the international
trade patterns for the period 1990–2010, identifying that China’s global presence in
the trade of parts and components increased. Although Mexico concentrated its
trade of parts and components with the US, the data showed that China has become
a major source of parts and components to Mexico and Brazil. The authors highlight
the increasing importance of a Pan-Paciﬁc link and a possible creation of a China–
Brazil–Mexico production network.
Florensa et al. (2015) produced the ﬁrst paper that used a quantitative framework
to analyze economic integration and production fragmentation in Latin America.
Using trade data classiﬁed according to the Broad Economic Categories (BEC), the
authors analyzed the impact that changes in import of intermediate goods from
different world regions had in the development of Latin America’s regional trade.
They found evidence of increasing regional production networks and the importance
of other regions as suppliers of intermediate products, with special attention on
China.
Given the importance of this topic to the development literature and that
production networks in Latin America are still understudied, this work contributes
to the literature shedding light on the evolution of Latin American machinery
industry. The ﬁrst reason to focus on this industry is that machinery ﬁnal products
have a high level of complexity and use of a large number of parts and components,
being the most developed manufacturing industry in terms of production fragmentation. Consequently, when the industry is more fragmented, a country will have
more opportunities to engage in the production network. The second reason is that
the high level of fragmentation and the availability of disaggregated trade data allow
us to classify this industry into four different sectors. This division permits the
development of a ﬁner correspondence between parts and components and ﬁnal
products for a speciﬁc sector, reducing the bias that more aggregated data can
generate. Finally, the share of machinery in Latin American exports and imports of
manufactured products in 1996 was approximately 49.5 and 55.8%, respectively,
while in 2011, the shares increased to 55.5 and 56.7%, respectively. Therefore,
machinery is the most important industry in the region’s manufacturing trade.2
The contribution of this article is threefold. First, to the best of our knowledge,
this is the ﬁrst article to analyze the quality effects that the changes in the structural
composition of suppliers of parts and components have had in the development of

The shares were calculated based on the harmonized system (HS) classiﬁcation. The manufactured
the previous papers on Latin American production networks that use aggregated
intermediate manufacture data, we focus our analysis on a speciﬁc industry and use
disaggregated data. Third, in this paper we adopt a model similar to Florensa et al.
(2015), but estimate it using the PPML method instead of the ordinary least squares
(OLS) to control the zero trade values and the data heteroscedasticity.
The study is organized as follows. Section 2 includes a descriptive analysis of
Latin America’s participation in the machinery trade. In Sect. 3, we present the data
and in Sect. 4 we describe the empirical methodology employed. Section 5 shows
the results of the quantity analysis, while Sect. 6 contains the results for the quality
analysis. The ﬁnal considerations of the paper are available in Sect. 7.

2 Machinery international trade and Latin America
In this section, we used trade data—classiﬁed according to the Harmonized System
(HS) disaggregated to the six-digit level—to analyze the machinery international
market and Latin America’s participation in it in 1996 and 2011. We also
considered the changes in trade patterns from a trade margin and product
sophistication perspective to identify modiﬁcations in Latin American countries’
trade basket composition.
2.1 Descriptive analysis: traded values
Production networks, in particular the machinery ones, are constituted mainly of
geographical agglomerations that form regional blocs of production. Three main
regional blocs are recognized for machinery production: the East Asian region, the
European Union, and NAFTA. In general, machinery trade studies focus on these
main areas, ignoring the situation in Latin America and the rest of the world. The
main reason for this fact is illustrated by Fig. 1, which shows the data for world
imports and exports of machinery. The aforementioned main areas are responsible
for the bulk of the traded values, while Latin America and the rest of the world are
responsible for a very small share.3 Another important difference is that the traded
value of parts and components is larger than the ﬁnal product in the three main
regions, while in Latin America, the traded value of the ﬁnal product is higher. This
evidence suggests a lower engagement of Latin America in machinery production
networks.
The idiosyncrasies of Latin America, a heterogeneous region composed of
countries of different sizes and governments with different political and economic
orientation, localized in a vast territory full of geographical barriers, such as the
Andes Mountains and the Amazon Forest, are possible reasons for its low level of
engagement in production networks. Another reason, identiﬁed by Moreira et al.

and Kimura (2015)

(2013), is the quality of the local infrastructure that penalizes the trade, increasing
the freight costs or simply making it impracticable at competitive prices.
Nevertheless, Fig. 2 reveals that for the period 1996–2011 parts and components
traded value increased relative to ﬁnal products. Latin American export data show
an increase in traded parts and components from 46.6 percentage points to 54.4
percentage points. Although import data reveal an increase in traded parts and
components share of just 0.5 percentage points, in terms of values this change
represents a substantial increase, given that imported machinery parts and
components value is higher than the exported machinery total value. Even though
traded values are still smaller than the three main blocs, the increase in import of
parts and components indicate that Latin America is slowly adhering to production
networks in the machinery industry. Table 1 displays the compound annual growth
rate of the machinery trade, revealing that Latin America had the highest growth
rate for total machinery export and the second highest for machinery import. In fact,
considering just the trade of parts and components, the region had the highest
growth rates, corroborating the idea that participation in machinery production
networks is growing in this region.
According to fragmentation theory, the core of a production network is
concentrated in regional agglomerations, given the reduced costs incurred in
shorter distance transport freights, reduced lead time, and the possibility of faster
coordination for the whole network (Harrigan and Venables 2004; Kimura et al.
2007). Nonetheless, the development of the internet and other communication and
coordination technologies, as well as the decrease in freight cost, has led to a
decrease in the service link costs (Jones and Kierzkowski 2005), allowing for a
growth in interactions between regional blocs. As a result, the East Asian region
increased its role as a supplier of machinery parts and components to other region’s

composition of parts and components suppliers for all ﬁve regions to verify changes
and patterns. As expected, except for NAFTA in 2011, the intra-bloc import of
machinery parts and components is dominant in the three main regions. We also
verify an increase of the East Asian share in all regions. Data for Latin America
reveal a few things: ﬁrst, the Latin American share as a supplier is irrelevant in all
regions except Latin America; second, its intra-bloc share is smaller than the shares

was the region where the share of East Asian parts and components increased the
most, a growth of more than 20 percentage points.
From the perspective of production fragmentation logic, a country purchases
more parts and components from a given region if these products have some
comparative advantage. The existing literature highlights two channels through
which access to inputs can beneﬁt a country: an efﬁciency gain in the production
process by the acquisition of cheaper and/or higher quality inputs (Amiti and
Konings 2007; Goldberg et al. 2010) and the possibility of having access to inputs
that previously could not be produced domestically or obtained from a third country
(Goldberg et al. 2009). In both cases, a gain in productivity and changes in
production pattern are expected. Based on this fact, we consider the hypothesis that
the increase in import of parts and components, especially from East Asia, should be
beneﬁcial to Latin American machinery production networks.
In the next subsection, we analyze the trade margins to identify possible trade
pattern modiﬁcations.
2.2 Descriptive analysis: the trade margins approach
The trade ﬂow can be decomposed in extensive and intensive margins, revealing
how the intensiﬁcation of trade in existing relations and the beginning or ending of
trade relations contribute to change this ﬂow. Although the intensive margin is
expected to be the main factor responsible for the changes, authors such as
Hummels and Klenow (2005) and Kehoe and Ruhl (2013) identiﬁed that in situations
of considerable trade growth the extensive margin contribution is also relevant. Our
main interest in observing the extensive margins is to identify evidence of changes
in Latin American countries’ import and export baskets.
A country’s trade relation is understood as a product–destination pair in the case
of exports and a product–supplier pair in the case of imports. Given an initial and a
ﬁnal period, if a pair is active in both periods it is classiﬁed as a continuing pair. If
country A imported (exported) a given product from (to) country B in the ﬁrst
period and then does not in the second period, but it still imports (exports) the
product in question from (to) a third country, we have an exit of supplier
(destination). If a similar situation occurs, but in the second period the product in
question is not imported (exported) from (to) any other country, then it is classiﬁed
as an exit of product. If in the second period, country A imports (exports) a product
that was not imported (exported) from (to) any other country in the ﬁrst period, then
this new relation is classiﬁed as an enter of product. If in the second period, country
A starts to import (export) from (to) country B a product that was already imported
(exported) in the ﬁrst period from (to) a third country, then this new relation is
classiﬁed as an entry of supplier (destination).
Considering only the number of relations, Fig. 4 illustrates the margins of each
Latin American country import of machinery parts and components. Mexico and
Brazil had the highest number of product–supplier active pairs in 2011, while El
Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua and Paraguay had the lowest number of active pairs.

of supplier margin had a very important contribution in all cases, signaling an
increasing integration of Latin America in the international economy.
Following Obashi and Kimura (2016), we identify the contribution that each
margin had in the trade growth. To calculate these contributions, we use the
following methodology:

the entering countries, EXPc are the exiting products, and EXCc are the exiting
countries.
Figure 5 conﬁrms that the most important contribution is the intensive margin.
Even though the supplier entry contribution is not as big as in the previous ﬁgure, it
still accounted for an important portion of the parts and components import growth,
indicating that the Latin American countries increased their diversity of parts and
margins from 1996 to 2011 (%). Source Author’s calculation, using data available from the UN Comtrade

We also observe the contribution of the extensive and intensive margins in Latin
American countries exports to verify if there were changes in the variety of exported
products and destinations. Figure 6 shows the export margins considering only the
numbers of product–destination pairs. Once again, the entry of new destinations and
the continuation of existing pairs are important margins. However, this time the
entry of new products is also important, indicating a change in the exported goods
variety. Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico already had a more developed industrial park
in 1996; consequently, their entry of products is very small. Another interesting
feature is that in some cases the exit of products and destinations is large, also
indicating a change in the export basket composition.
Next, we decompose the export growth according to its respective margins.
Figure 7 reveals different patterns. The growth in countries with more developed
industrial parks such as Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico focused on the intensive
margin (Honduras is an exception, having a similar pattern to these countries). The
entry of new products was an important margin in countries such as Ecuador,
Nicaragua, Paraguay, and Uruguay, while in other cases, the entry of new product–
destination pairs was more important. In countries such as Bolivia, El Salvador,
Peru, and Venezuela, the exit of products and destinations had an important role,
showing an export basket specialization tendency.
The previous ﬁgures offer evidence that the pattern of Latin American countries’
imports and exports changed during the studied period. We performed one
1996 to 2011. Source Author’s calculation, using data available from the UN Comtrade

predominant increase in the variety of exports to Latin American countries,

Given the economic growth of China after the WTO accession in 2001, we consider the importance of
disentangling the impacts of this country from the rest of the East Asian region. We separate the East
Asian region into two groups: a ﬁrst group composed only of China and Hong Kong (hereafter referred to
as China), and a second group composed of the other countries in the region that we address as East Asia
433 machinery parts and components and 691 machinery ﬁnal products. Source Author’s calculation,

followed by an increase in the variety of parts and components exported to other
regions.
Given the evidence of change in the import and export pattern of Latin American
countries, in the next subsection we analyze the changes on traded products quality.
2.3 Descriptive analysis: sophistication level
Concomitant to the increase in Latin America’s machinery trade ﬂow and changes
in the structural composition of machinery parts and components suppliers, a
modiﬁcation in the trade basket composition is expected. To evaluate this change,
we used the PRODY index5 developed in Hausmann et al. (2007). According to the
authors, the PRODY ‘‘index is a weighted average of the per capita GDP of
countries exporting a given product, and thus represents the income level associated
with that product’’. In other words, this index attributes to each one of the products a
value that varies according to the share and per capita GDP of the countries that
export it. This result means that products with higher PRODY values were exported
more by developed countries, while products with lower PRODY values were

exported more by developing countries. The PRODY index can be used as a proxy
for the sophistication of the product.
Table 2 contains the PRODY index summary statistics for all products according
to the HS classiﬁcation disaggregated to the six-digit level. The index varies from
747.7 to 46,860.5, and the mean is 14,171.7. Although the index represents the
income level associated with a given product, it is hard to attribute a sense of
cardinality, making it easier to interpret as an ordinal index. In the lower part of the
table, the products were classiﬁed into three different categories.6 We observe that
non-manufactured products have the lowest PRODY index mean, while machinery
products have the highest. Additionally, the standard deviation of the machinery
goods PRODY index is the lowest, indicating that, in general, the products of this
category are more sophisticated than the others.
Next, we use the PRODY index to calculate the sophistication of the parts and
components import basket and the intra-bloc export basket. The objective is to
verify if changes in the parts and components import pattern led to changes in the
pattern of the Latin American intra-bloc trade. Figure 9 reveals that for six countries
the average sophistication degree of their machinery parts and components imports
decreased, while the rest experienced an increase in the sophistication level.
Figure 10 illustrates the changes in the sophistication of the intra-regional export
basket. We observed a decrease in the sophistication level of the ﬁnal products
export basket for seven countries, while the same occurs for just ﬁve countries in the
parts and components export basket case. Although the results are not homogeneous, we verify gains in the export basket sophistication for the majority of the
countries.
2.4 Descriptive analysis: machinery sector data
According to previous studies on machinery production networks, the machinery
industry can be classiﬁed into four different sectors: general machinery, electric
machinery, transport equipment, and precision machinery. Based on this classiﬁcation, Fig. 11 reveals Latin America’s machinery parts and components imports by
sector. We observe that electric parts and components had the biggest share in both

years, although it declines in 2011. General machinery had the second biggest share,
followed by transport equipment. Figure 12 plots the share of each sector in regional
exports of ﬁnal products and parts and components. Despite the observed increase in
export pattern with electric machinery achieving the second biggest share. A similar
movement occurred for the case of parts and components exports. Observing the
total exports share, we identify that transport equipment products were the most
exported ones inside Latin America, while electric machinery became the second
most traded in 2011. Based on the importance of these two sectors and that the study
of their heterogeneity be a common practice in the literature, we also investigate
them independently.
In view of the facts presented in this section, the change in Latin America’s
machinery trade pattern, the increase in trade ﬂows and the modiﬁcation in the
average sophistication level of the traded products, in the next sections, we present
the data and methodology employed to study the effects that changes in the
structural composition of machinery parts and components suppliers had in the
expansion of Latin American production networks and in the sophistication of the
intra-bloc export basket.

3 Data
In the economics literature, many studies have been conducted on the fragmentation
of production with different ways of deﬁning the object of study. Some scholars
employ a more comprehensive deﬁnition of production networks, including in their
analysis all inputs used, from the raw materials to the ﬁnal product. To capture all
production steps they use international input–output tables.7 On the other hand,
some scholars do not consider the raw materials in their analysis, understanding that
just the trade of parts and components used in a given industry should be analyzed.
This second group of researchers adopt a more reﬁned classiﬁcation to isolate parts
and components from ﬁnal products.8
We embrace the second view for two reasons: no international input–output data
are available for the majority of the Latin American countries, and the second
deﬁnition permits the use of more disaggregated and speciﬁc data. Considering that
the machinery industry presents a high level of complexity and uses a large number
of parts and components, we adopted this industry as our object of study.
The analysis of machinery production networks was based on the classiﬁcation of
the machinery trade in parts and components and ﬁnal products.9 The data used was
collected from the United Nations Commodity Trade Statistics Database (UN
Comtrade), classiﬁed according to the HS disaggregated to the six-digit level. The
machinery industry comprises all the goods categorized as general machinery sector
7

For example, Timmer et al. (2015) used the World Input–Output Database (WIOD), while Baldwin and
Lopez-Gonzalez (2015) employed WIOD and OECD-WTO TiVA data to analyze production networks.

8

For example, Athukorala (2005) separates manufacturing parts and components from ﬁnal products
using the SITC data, while Ando and Kimura (2005) do the same for the machinery industry using HS
data.

9

This process was performed in accordance with the classiﬁcation presented in Ando and Kimura
and precision machinery sector (HS90–92).
We consider the import of parts and components from countries that were
responsible for at least 0.01% of the international machinery trade in 2011. The
selected 89 countries are grouped in six regions.10 We deﬁne Latin America as the
group of 17 countries consisting of Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia,
Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua,
Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela.
The PRODY measure was employed as the qualitative measure for the export and
import basket of Latin American countries.11 We also used tariff data and the depth
of the Preferential Trade Agreements (PTA)12 to account for the level of integration
of the Latin American economies. The tariff data were collected from the World
Integrated Trade Solution (WITS)13 and the PTAs depth measures were calculated
based on Mulabdic et al. (2017) using the contents of trade agreements from the
World Bank database (Hofmann et al. 2016). Given the availability of tariff and
trade data, this study is restricted to the period from 1996 to 2011.

4 Methodology
Because the core of production networks is regionally concentrated, in this work, we
focus on the impacts that changes in the structural composition of parts and
components suppliers have on Latin America’s intra-bloc exports. For this empirical
exercise, we use a model known as the workhorse of empirical international trade
analysis: the gravity model (Baier and Bergstrand 2007). The gravity model is
distinguished by its good ﬁt and its parsimonious and tractable representation of
economic interactions among many countries, also allowing for disaggregation of
the trade in different levels of geographical organization and product classiﬁcation
(Anderson 2011).
To quantify the impact that changes in the structural composition of parts and
components suppliers had on the development of the intra-bloc machinery trade, we
follow the methodology proposed by Florensa et al. (2015), an augmented gravity
model that accounts for the effect of the import of intermediate products. The
adoption of such a framework is justiﬁed by the fact that, different from the standard
gravity framework, this version accounts for the effect that the import of parts and
10

The list containing the 89 countries divided by regions is available in the Table 8 in ‘‘Appendix’’.

We use the PRODY measures calculated by Hausmann et al. (2007). According to the authors they
‘‘constructed the PRODY measure for a consistent sample of countries that reported trade data in each of
the years 1999–2001. These indexes are the result of an average of 3 years’’ (Hausmann et al. 2007).
Because the chosen years are previous to the Chinese accession to the World Trade Organization, the
possibility of a downward bias in the ranking of the machinery goods (in particular, ﬁnal goods, given the
increase in multinationals assembling their ﬁnal products China) is minimized.
12
We thank an anonymous referee for suggesting the use of PTAs depth to implicitly control non-tariff
barriers.
13
Tariff data were classiﬁed to HS six-digit level and when necessary was converted to the HS1992
intra-bloc exports. The proposed model assumes that in the ﬁrst period, Latin
American countries can import parts and components from any region of the world.
These parts and components are employed to produce other parts and components
that in a second period will be used domestically or traded with another country.
Alternatively, they can be used to manufacture a ﬁnal product that will be consumed
domestically or traded with a third country. We assume that Latin American
production networks are created when Latin American countries use parts and
components imported from any region of the world to produce a ﬁnal product or
other parts and components that are exported to another Latin American country.
The Latin American intra-bloc trade of ﬁnal products and parts and components
in a given year is explained by the tariffs imposed by the importer country in the
same year and the exporter country imports of parts and components in the previous
year. We augment the Florensa et al. (2015) model to capture the possible effects of
the non-tariff barriers by adding a PTA depth measure. The PTA depth index
calculation follows Mulabdic et al. (2017): based on the content of the trade
agreements database, we count the number of legally enforceable provisions
covered by each agreement and normalize it between 0 and 1.
Fixed-effect dummies are used to capture all sources of unobserved heterogeneity
that are constant for each period of time, individual, and sector. Following Anderson
and van Wincoop (2003, 2004), exporter-time and importer-time dummies are
employed to control for the multilateral resistance, sector dummies control for
unobserved heterogeneities of each machinery sector, while exporter–importer
dummies are added to guard against unobserved heterogeneities on the relation of
each country pair (Baier and Bergstrand 2007). The proposed models were deﬁned
as follows:

where XFijkt and XPCijkt denote the traded value of ﬁnal products and parts and
components from country i to country j (these countries are limited to Latin
American countries only) of sector k in year t. The traded values are explained by
country i’s imports of parts and components of sector k from a given region r in year
t - 1 (M pcriktÀ1 ), the tariff imposed by the importing country j over the product of
sector k provided by country i in time t tariff jikt , the depth measure of the PTA
between country i and j in year t depthijt , exporter-time and importer-time dummies
deﬁnition of the object of study. As already mentioned, we selected a more speciﬁc
object of study, focusing on the machinery industry alone. This allows us to use
more disaggregated and detailed data, increasing the reﬁnement of the parts and
components and ﬁnal products correspondence. Additionally, we can classify
machinery industry products into four different sectors, decreasing the bias that can
result from the use of aggregated data.
Based on previous works about production fragmentation and use of imported
inputs, it is expected that the purchase of parts and components from another
country should provide some efﬁciency gain or advantage to Latin American
countries. Based on this fact, we expect that the increase in imports of parts and
components from the East Asian region should guarantee a production gain for
Latin American countries, increasing the intra-bloc machinery trade.
An important contribution of this paper is that the analysis is not limited to the
quantity impact of the import of parts and components on the intra-bloc trade; we
also propose a way of verifying quality changes. Since we know that there was a
change in the shares of machinery parts and components providers, we attempt to
evaluate if this variation also produced a modiﬁcation in the Latin American intrabloc trade pattern. Once again, it is expected that if the East Asian region is more
efﬁcient in the production of machinery parts and components, providing inputs
with higher quality and/or cheaper prices, Latin American countries should be able
to diversify and improve the quality of their intra-bloc trade basket.
To check this hypothesis, we propose a substitution of the traded values by a
trade basket sophistication index that is calculated based on the PRODY index
developed in Hausmann et al. (2007). The PRODY index can be used as a proxy for
the sophistication of the product, and according to Hausmann et al. (2007), countries
that have an export basket more similar to the developed countries tend to register
economic growth in the subsequent periods. Based on this concept and the
importance of economic growth for the development of Latin American countries,
we use the PRODY index to calculate the composition of the import basket of parts
and components (IMPY index) and the intra-bloc export basket (EXPY index). The
objective is to estimate if the imports of parts and components from speciﬁc regions
contributed or not to bring the Latin American intra-bloc export basket closer to the
developed countries. The proposed models are deﬁned as follows:

where EXPYFijkt and EXPYPCijkt denote the EXPY index attributed to the basket of
The EXPY index is calculated as the weighted average of the PRODY index of each
component of the basket of a given sector. The EXPY index attributed to the baskets
of ﬁnal products and parts and components traded inside Latin America is explained
by the IMPY index attributed to the basket of parts and components of sector k that
country i imported from a given region r in year t - 1 (IMPY pcriktÀ1 ), the depth
measure of the PTA between country i and j in year t depthijt , the tariff imposed by
the importing country j over the product of sector k provided by country i in time t
tariff jikt , the exporter-time and importer-time dummies (time is deﬁned as a 5-year
period), and the sector and the importer–exporter dummies.

5 Results: quantity analysis
A common characteristic of trade data is the existence of missing and zero trade
values. As the natural logarithm of zero does not exist, the estimated regressions do
not consider the zero trade values that are important information about the trade
pattern. The dropped data are information not used in the estimation, possibly
leading to a bias in the regression results.14 To avoid this problem, we estimate the
regressions using the pseudo-Poisson maximum likelihood (PPML) method (Santos
Silva and Tenreyro 2006). The PPML is the most accepted technique in the gravity
model literature, allowing us to account for the observations with zero trade
values.15 In addition, trade data are plagued by heteroscedasticity, consequently the
use of OLS can lead to the estimation of biased elasticities (Santos Silva and
Tenreyro 2006).
We ﬁrst estimate Eqs. (2) and (3) for the values of the pooled machinery intrabloc exports. We also consider separate estimations for the main machinery sectors:
electric machinery and transport equipment.
The ﬁrst half of Table 3 contains the results for the intra-bloc exports of
machinery ﬁnal products. The tariff coefﬁcient for the pooled data regression is
negative and statistically signiﬁcant, indicating that reductions in import tariffs of
machinery ﬁnal products are associated with increases in their intra-bloc exports.
Consequently, the advance of the regional integration in Latin America through the
decrease in the import tariffs imposed over the intra-bloc machinery trade have a
positive impact on the development of Latin American machinery production
networks. On the opposite side, the coefﬁcient for PTA depth is statistically
insigniﬁcant, showing that changes in non-tariff barriers do not affect production
networks. The variables related to the origin of the imported parts and components
reveal that an intensiﬁcation of imports from the rest of the world (ROW), East Asia
(EA), and Latin American (LA) countries, increase the intra-bloc trade of ﬁnal
products in the subsequent period. The results reveal that a 1% increase in imports
14
The share of dropped values when the OLS method is employed ranges from around 17–29% of the
total values estimated with the PPML technique.

of parts and components from LA leads to an increase of 0.53% in the intra-bloc
exports of ﬁnal products. The coefﬁcient for imports from EA is also high,
approximately 0.45%, while imports from the ROW have a smaller effect,
approximately 0.15%. On the other hand, the coefﬁcient of imports from the North
America16 and China are negative, indicating a decrease on the intra-bloc trade of
ﬁnal machinery products of 0.32 and 0.27%, respectively. Although it is not
possible to identify the exact reasons why imports from these suppliers do not
stimulate intra-bloc trade, we consider a few hypotheses. The ﬁrst is that an
important share of imported parts and components are used in domestic production
networks being consumed in the domestic market. Given the lack of data we cannot
verify this hypothesis. A second possibility is that a share of these parts and
16

This case is beyond the scope of this paper. It could also be the case that imports
from these regions are used to produce parts and components that are exported to
other Latin American countries. If that is the case, coefﬁcients will be positive in the
second half of the table, when dependent variables are parts and components
exports.
Results in the second column refer to the electric machinery trade. The import
tariff coefﬁcient is negative, indicating that a decrease of 1% in the tariffs imposed
on electric machinery parts and components imports, all ceteris paribus, stimulates
an increase of 0.12% in intra-bloc exports of electric machinery ﬁnal products. Once
again, the coefﬁcient for imports from North America is negative, indicating that a
1% increase in imports from this region causes a decrease in the intra-bloc exports
of ﬁnal electric machinery of 0.52%. Imports from the ROW also have a negative
impact of 0.24%. On the opposite side, a 1% increase in imports of electric
machinery parts and components from China promotes an intensiﬁcation of 0.22%
in the intra-bloc trade of ﬁnal products. The PTA depth coefﬁcient is statistically
signiﬁcant and indicates that deeper agreements lead to a decrease in the intraregional trade of electric machinery ﬁnal products. According to Hofmann et al.
(2016), agreements between developing countries are in general less deep and focus
more on the decrease of import tariffs, since they are still high.17 This is in
accordance with our ﬁndings that show that decreases in import tariffs are more
efﬁcient than deeper agreements in the promotion of intra-bloc electric machinery
ﬁnal products exports. Additionally, in Latin America shallow agreements embrace
more members, while deeper ones are in general bilateral agreements involving
Mexico and Central American countries. Consequently, members of shallower
agreements, such as the Mercosur, promote higher trade ﬂows among themselves
than members of deeper agreements. Lastly, according to Baier and Bergstrand
(2007), all PTAs are ‘‘phased-in’’ over time, approximately 5–10 years. Therefore,
older and shallower agreements, implemented in the 1990s, should have bigger
impacts than the deeper ones, the majority of which were implemented in 2009,
only 2 years before the end of the period studied.18
With regard to transport equipment, the results are almost all statistically
insigniﬁcant. The exception is the coefﬁcient for imports from the ROW, indicating
that a 1% increase in imports of transport equipment parts and components from this
region leads to an increase of 0.18% in intra-bloc exports of ﬁnal transport
equipment.
The second half of Table 3 displays the intra-bloc parts and components export
coefﬁcients. In this case, import tariff and PTA depth coefﬁcients are statistically
insigniﬁcant, signaling an increase in regional integration through the decrease of
the import tariffs or non-tariff barriers would not affect the production fragmentation and relocation inside Latin America. Imports of parts and components from
17
The mean of the import tariff between Latin American countries in the studied period was 6.89% for
machinery ﬁnal products and 5.64% for machinery parts and components. For the case of electric
machinery, the average import tariffs are 9.92% for ﬁnal products and 6.62% for parts and components.

coefﬁcients. As observed in Florensa et al. (2015), imports of parts and components
from these regions generate what they called a ‘‘complementary effect’’. In other
words, they stimulate production fragmentation and its relocation inside Latin
America, since parts and components imported by a Latin American country in the
ﬁrst period produce other parts and components that will be used in a third Latin
American country, promoting these countries engagement in machinery productions
networks. A 1% increase in parts and components imports from LA results in an
increase of 0.64% of the intra-bloc export of parts and components. Imports from
North America promote an increase of 0.31%, while imports from the ROW have a
smaller effect of 0.19%.
In the speciﬁc case of electric machinery, imports from EA stimulate the intrabloc trade of parts and components with a coefﬁcient of 0.39%, while imports from
European Union (EU) and North America have a negative effect. In the case of
transport equipment, the LA coefﬁcient is positive, while the North American one is
negative. Florensa et al. (2015) refer to the situation when coefﬁcients are negative
as the ‘‘substitution effect’’, because instead of enhancing the development of
production networks among Latin American countries, it promotes trade inside
domestic markets or with countries in third regions.
Evidence indicates that increases in the import of parts and components from LA
have the biggest positive impact in the creation of a Latin American machinery
production network. This result aligns with Florensa et al. (2015) and the production
fragmentation theory that states that the core of production networks is regionally
organized. Imports from North America, a region that is geographically close to
Latin America and known for engaging in back-and-forth intra-ﬁrm production
network transactions with Mexico and Central American countries, presented mixed
results. It stimulates the intra-bloc trade of machinery parts and components in
general, but decreases the trade of ﬁnal products. Conversely, the results indicate
that in the speciﬁc case of electric machineries, imports from EA and China foment
production fragmentation. This result also aligns with Florensa et al. (2015) and
Fung et al. (2015b) who veriﬁed an increase of parts and components supplies from
Asian countries supporting Latin America’s engagement in production networks.
As mentioned in Sect. 2, Latin America is an area where economic integration
still lags behind other regions of the globe. Although there are 21 different PTAs
signed by LA countries, none of them integrates the whole region. Given this fact,
we perform one extra exercise to explore the heterogeneity inside the region. Based
on economic proximity and negotiated PTAs, we classiﬁed Latin America into three
subregions: one composed of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay, who are
members of Mercosur; a second composed of Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru,
and Venezuela who are members of the Andean Community (CAN); and a third
with the members of Central America (Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala,
Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama), Mexico and Chile.19
19
Venezuela was classiﬁed as part of CAN, because during the majority of the studied period it was a
member of it. Chile and Mexico were aggregated with Central American economies given the existence

Table 4 contains the results of machinery exports from each subregion.20 Given
the reduction in the number of observations, we consider only the pooled machinery
data results. The majority of the coefﬁcients are statistically insigniﬁcant for the
case of CAN exports. Indeed, among the three subregions, CAN is the one with the
smallest machinery trade. The results reveal that imports from LA and EA countries
enhance the intra-regional trade of ﬁnal machinery by 0.5 and 0.36%, while imports
20

components by 0.4%. In the cases of Central America, Mexico and Chile, we
observe that imports from EA, LA and North America enhance the intra-regional
trade of machinery ﬁnal products by 0.15, 0.32, and 0.42%, respectively. Imports
from these three regions and the ROW enhance the regional trade of parts and
components by 0.25, 0.45, 0.58, and 0.23%, respectively. On the opposite side,
imports from China and EU have negative effects. The results indicate that
production fragmentation in Central America, Mexico and Chile is stronger than in
CAN, with EA, LA and North America, who, in ascending order, have been
important suppliers for the regional production networks. Though composed of only
four economies, Mercosur is responsible for the biggest intra-bloc machinery trade.
The results also indicate that imports from the ROW and EA stimulate the exports
of ﬁnal products, while imports from the ROW and China enhance the exports of
parts and components inside Latin America. Coefﬁcients for EA and China are
higher than the ROW: a 1% increase in import of parts and components from EA
induced an increase of 0.66% in the intra-bloc trade of ﬁnal products compared with
0.15% for imports from the ROW, while imports from China promoted a 0.26%
increase in the intra-bloc trade of parts and components compared with 0.10% for
imports from the ROW. On the opposite side, imports from North America do not
stimulate the intra-bloc export of machinery.
We conclude that, different from Central American, Mexico and Chile,
production networks promoted by Mercosur countries depend more on imports
from China and EA, while imports from North America have a negative impact. In
this case, it seems that geographical and economic proximity still play an important
role, with North American imports fomenting the ﬁrst regions’ engagement in
production fragmentation, while in Mercosur’s case, a region more distant from
North America, the imports from EA and China are more important.

6 Results: quality analysis
Considering the wide range of machinery products and that some are more
sophisticated than the others, our next step is to examine which regions provide
parts and components that promote Latin American production networks of
products more similar to the ones produced by developed countries. Being involved
in the manufacturing process of products with higher sophistication level instead of
just buying the ﬁnal product from other regions, Latin American countries gain
access to technology, beneﬁt from positive spillover effects, and increase the
possibilities of enjoying economic growth.
The ﬁrst half of Table 5 presents the results for the intra-bloc trade of ﬁnal
products, while results for the intra-bloc trade of machinery parts and components
are in the second half. The ﬁrst notable feature is that the tariff coefﬁcient is positive
in all columns, indicating that a decrease in the import tariff leads to a decrease in
the sophistication of the machinery export basket. In other words, the export basket
becomes more similar to the developing countries. One possible interpretation for

Results that are statistically signiﬁcant and different from zero are highlighted using bold text

values that are comparatively easier to be produced by developing countries were
manufactured in most of the countries and were consumed in the domestic market,
while machinery products with a higher level of sophistication were produced by
just a few countries in the region and traded inside the bloc. The import tariff
reduction allowed for an increase in the intra-bloc trade and specialization. This
phenomenon promoted a faster growth in the trade of less sophisticated products
than the sophisticated ones.
Considering parts and components suppliers, we verify that imports from the
ROW, EU, EA, LA, and North America promoted an increase in the sophistication
of the ﬁnal products traded inside Latin America. A 1% increase in North American
participation in the import basket composition, all ceteris paribus, promotes an
increase of 0.06% in the quality of the intra-bloc export basket, while imports from
imports just from LA and North America had a positive effect in the electric
machinery sector, while the coefﬁcients for imports from other regions are
statistically insigniﬁcant. Increases of 1% in imports from North America promote
an increase of 0.07% in the quality of ﬁnal electric machinery intra-bloc export
basket, while imports from LA promote an increase of 0.06%. Transport equipment
coefﬁcients were all statistically insigniﬁcant. In the second half of Table 5, we
verify similar results for the case of pooled machinery data. North American
imports promote an increase of 0.1% in the quality of the parts and components
export basket, while imports from the EU and EA promote an increase of 0.04%
each. In column 5, the coefﬁcients are slightly different, revealing that imports only
from China promote a 0.04% increase in the intra-bloc export basket of electric
machinery parts and components, while imports from EA have a negative effect.
Once again, transport equipment coefﬁcients are statistically insigniﬁcant.
Results in this section partially support the hypothesis that an increase in imports
of parts and components from Asian countries promotes an increase in the quality of
the intra-bloc export basket. Nevertheless, imports from EU and North America had
a bigger positive effect. Table 6 presents the PRODY mean of the import basket
from each region in 1996 and 2011, revealing that import baskets from EU and
North America were still composed of products with a high sophistication level.
Given the increase in Asian product imports share in the detriment of imports from
both regions, we can conclude that imports from EU and North America
concentrated in higher sophistication products, while Asia supplied products with
a slightly lower level of sophistication at very competitive prices. Another
interesting feature is that, although the share of imports from the ROW is the
smallest one, imports from this region are concentrated in products with a very high
level of sophistication.
As in the previous section, we perform a similar exercise considering the exports
of countries classiﬁed in three different subregions to explore their differences.

from the ROW, EU, and EA promote an increase in the sophistication of the ﬁnal
products this region produced and exported inside LA. Conversely, imports from
North America and China have a surprisingly negative effect. The pattern does not
change even when intra-bloc exports of parts and components are considered. The
only difference is that LA imports have a negative impact. Table 6 reveals that from
1996 to 2011 the PRODY mean of this subregion import basket decreased,
coefﬁcient is positive and statistically signiﬁcant only in this case comprising the
Central American countries Chile and Mexico, a subregion with the deepest PTAs.
For the Andean Community members, imports of parts and components from EU
have a negative impact, while imports from EA and North America increase the
sophistication of the machinery ﬁnal products they export inside Latin America.
When intra-bloc exports of parts and components are considered, imports from the
ROW assume a positive coefﬁcient. Although Table 6 revealed no decrease in the
PRODY mean from 1996 to 2011, after econometrically controlling all variables,
the model reveals a negative effect on intra-bloc exports of parts and components in
the cases of imports from China, EA and EU.
Increases in EA and the ROW participation in Mercosur’s import basket
composition have a positive impact on Mercosur members’ exports of machinery
ﬁnal products and parts and components, while North American participation in the
import basket have a negative impact.
These results indicated that depending on the subregion, the origin of the imports
can have a positive or negative effect on the sophistication level of the machinery
exports inside Latin America. In general, imports from EA and the ROW had
positive effects, while imports from North America and China had negative impacts.
However, when we consider all Latin American countries, we verify positive
contributions from North American imports. The results indicate that in the case of
imports from China, the effect on the intra-bloc exports sophistication level were
not positive as expected, revealing that its exports to Latin America were still
composed of cheaper and less sophisticated parts and components. The exception is
in the speciﬁc case of electric machinery, where imports from China increased the
sophistication of the intra-bloc exports of parts and components.

7 Final considerations
In this paper, we investigated how the changes in the structural composition of Latin
America’s suppliers of machinery parts and components affected the development
of Latin American regional production networks. In our analysis, we considered a
quantity and a quality dimension of the impact of these imports.
In the ﬁrst part of the paper, the descriptive analysis indicated a growth in the import
of parts and components from all regions of the world. However, we observed that the
growth in imports from the East Asian region was higher, resulting in a change in the
structural composition of the suppliers. Concomitant with this composition change, we
also veriﬁed a modiﬁcation in the sophistication level on the intra-bloc exports. In the
second part of the paper, we proceeded with an econometric analysis to identify from
which regions the import of parts and components contributed more to develop
production networks inside Latin America and increase the sophistication level of the
traded products. The quantity analysis provided evidence that Latin American
production networks increased during the studied period, and they were fomented by
import of machinery parts and components from the ROW, LA, EA, and North
North America stimulated the intra-bloc trade of machinery parts and components in
general, decreasing the trade in speciﬁc machinery sectors. The expected result that the
increase in imports from EA and China fomented production networks inside Latin
America was conﬁrmed for the speciﬁc case of electric machineries. Conversely,
imports of parts and components from North America did not stimulate the intra-bloc
trade of machineries ﬁnal products and parts and components for the two speciﬁc
sectors analyzed.
Exploring subregional heterogeneities, we identiﬁed that imports from North
America had the highest positive impact in intra-bloc exports in the cases of the
exports from Central America, Chile and Mexico subregions, as well as the Andean
Community. Imports from EA and China had the highest positive effects in the case
of exports from Mercosur countries. It is possible that geographical and economic
proximity played an important role in this result, with North American imports
fomenting the ﬁrst two regions’ engagement in production fragmentation, while
imports from EA and China were more important for Mercosur members.
Considering the second dimension studied, the sophistication of the products traded
in Latin America’s regional production networks, the results provided evidence that
partially supported the hypothesis that increases in imports of parts and components
from Asian countries promote an increase in the quality of the intra-bloc export basket.
The EA coefﬁcient was positive for the pooled machinery data in Latin America and
almost all subregions, while imports from China increased the sophistication of intrabloc exports of electric machinery parts and components. The coefﬁcients for
subregional pooled machinery data imports from China were negative, revealing that its
exports to Latin America were still composed of cheaper and less sophisticated parts
and components. The results from imports from North America were mixed, with
negative coefﬁcients in the subregional cases and positive coefﬁcients when all Latin
American countries were analyzed.
The ﬁndings of this paper indicate that Latin American governments should
consider the possibility of being more proactive in the development of regional
policies to facilitate the import and use of machinery parts and components. The
heterogeneity between subregions indicates that countries from Mercosur could
beneﬁt more from imports from the EA and China to foment the expansion of
regional production networks and the increase in the sophistication level of the
machinery products traded inside Latin America, while North America appears as a
natural and better option for the other countries. Moreover, Latin American
countries could take advantage of the internalization of some machinery production
steps to engage in machinery production networks and decrease the imports of
machinery ﬁnal products from third regions. These initial policies can proportionate
economic growth and other positive spillover effects. In the medium and long term,
these strategies could help Latin American countries overcome the lack of
competitiveness in given machinery products and enhance the region’s participation
in the international machinery trade.

Abstract This paper investigates the effects that the increase in the importation of
machinery parts and components and the changes in the supplier composition had in
the trade of ﬁnal products and parts and components inside Latin America. In our
analysis, we consider these effects according to two dimensions: a quantity one that
captures whether there was an intensiﬁcation of trade and a quality one that captures
changes in the sophistication of the traded goods. The research employs disaggregated trade data obtained from UN Comtrade for 17 Latin American countries
between 1996 and 2011. We ﬁnd evidence that an increase in the importation of
parts and components from Latin America had positive impacts on both the quantity
and quality dimensions. Subregional heterogeneities revealed that, in general,
imports from East Asia had positive effects on the quantity dimension, nurturing the
expansion of machinery production networks inside Latin America, and on the
quality dimension, increasing the sophistication of the products traded inside Latin
America, especially for Mercosur member exports. Imports from North America
had positive quantity effects, especially for exports of countries from the Andean
Community, Central America, Chile, and Mexico.

In the past few decades international trade has increased exponentially and
production fragmentation was one of the main causes. The fragmentation process,
referred as ‘‘trade in tasks’’ by Grossman and Rossi-Hansberg (2008), has led to an
increase in global integration, generating a web of economic interactions commonly
denoted as international production networks. In the beginning, this change
involved mostly trade among rich nations, but the real ‘‘revolution started when
supply chain trade gained importance among high-tech and low-wage nations
between 1985 and 1995’’ (Baldwin and Lopez-Gonzalez 2015). Production
fragmentation opened new possibilities of economic growth to developing
countries, allowing their engagement in the production process of manufactured
goods that they were not able to produce.
The expansion of production networks changed the rules of the economic
development game, facilitating developing countries’ access to networks, global
markets, capital, knowledge, and technology (OECD 2013). Previously, a country
had to climb every single step in the industrial development ladder, mastering all
production processes, to manufacture a given good. However, the advent of
production networks offered the possibility of skipping steps in the catch-up
procedure through the acquisition of knowledge and technology from third countries
and the specialization in one or few steps of the production process. Understanding
these changes and their consequent implications is crucial to draw policies that
integrate a country in this new production structure and allow it to explore the best
possibilities for guaranteeing sustainable economic growth and development.
The empirical literature about production fragmentation is very rich, with many
studies focusing on the regions where production fragmentation is more developed:
East Asia, the European Union, and North America.1 Although the demand is
growing for the analysis of the current situation and the effects that this new trend
can have on Latin America, the literature is still incipient.
A few papers provide some information about the status of production
fragmentation in Latin America based on descriptive analysis. Aminian et al.
(2009) compared the economic integration process in East Asia and Latin America,
analyzing the characteristics and intensity of intra-bloc and inter-bloc trade. They
used a revealed comparative advantage (RCA) index to identify the share of traded
manufacture parts and components with comparative advantage in the intra-bloc
trade. Curran and Zignago (2013) studied the regionalization of trade in South
America from 1994 to 2007, differentiating the trade ﬂows by the end use of the
products and the level of embodied technology. They concluded that the trade
agreements have not extensively affected the regional trade level and that trade of
intermediate products was still very low, indicating that regional production
networks were still under-developed. Calfat et al. (2011) investigated the
participation of Argentina, Brazil, Guatemala, and Nicaragua in fragmented world

participation in fragmented production. Fung et al. (2015a) used manufacturing
trade data, classiﬁed according to the Standard International Trade Classiﬁcation
(SITC), to compare production sharing in Latin America, North America, and East
Asia from 1985 to 2006. They identiﬁed the existence of a relatively thick
production network involving the trade of parts of motor vehicles, telecommunication equipment, and electronic components. However, it was concentrated on
Mexico’s trade with US and Canada, while Brazil also played a smaller role. Fung
et al. (2015b) used the same data and methodology to compare Brazil, China, and
Mexico’s participation in production networks. They analyzed the international
trade patterns for the period 1990–2010, identifying that China’s global presence in
the trade of parts and components increased. Although Mexico concentrated its
trade of parts and components with the US, the data showed that China has become
a major source of parts and components to Mexico and Brazil. The authors highlight
the increasing importance of a Pan-Paciﬁc link and a possible creation of a China–
Brazil–Mexico production network.
Florensa et al. (2015) produced the ﬁrst paper that used a quantitative framework
to analyze economic integration and production fragmentation in Latin America.
Using trade data classiﬁed according to the Broad Economic Categories (BEC), the
authors analyzed the impact that changes in import of intermediate goods from
different world regions had in the development of Latin America’s regional trade.
They found evidence of increasing regional production networks and the importance
of other regions as suppliers of intermediate products, with special attention on
China.
Given the importance of this topic to the development literature and that
production networks in Latin America are still understudied, this work contributes
to the literature shedding light on the evolution of Latin American machinery
industry. The ﬁrst reason to focus on this industry is that machinery ﬁnal products
have a high level of complexity and use of a large number of parts and components,
being the most developed manufacturing industry in terms of production fragmentation. Consequently, when the industry is more fragmented, a country will have
more opportunities to engage in the production network. The second reason is that
the high level of fragmentation and the availability of disaggregated trade data allow
us to classify this industry into four different sectors. This division permits the
development of a ﬁner correspondence between parts and components and ﬁnal
products for a speciﬁc sector, reducing the bias that more aggregated data can
generate. Finally, the share of machinery in Latin American exports and imports of
manufactured products in 1996 was approximately 49.5 and 55.8%, respectively,
while in 2011, the shares increased to 55.5 and 56.7%, respectively. Therefore,
machinery is the most important industry in the region’s manufacturing trade.2
The contribution of this article is threefold. First, to the best of our knowledge,
this is the ﬁrst article to analyze the quality effects that the changes in the structural
composition of suppliers of parts and components have had in the development of
2

The shares were calculated based on the harmonized system (HS) classiﬁcation. The manufactured
the previous papers on Latin American production networks that use aggregated
intermediate manufacture data, we focus our analysis on a speciﬁc industry and use
disaggregated data. Third, in this paper we adopt a model similar to Florensa et al.
(2015), but estimate it using the PPML method instead of the ordinary least squares
(OLS) to control the zero trade values and the data heteroscedasticity.
The study is organized as follows. Section 2 includes a descriptive analysis of
Latin America’s participation in the machinery trade. In Sect. 3, we present the data
and in Sect. 4 we describe the empirical methodology employed. Section 5 shows
the results of the quantity analysis, while Sect. 6 contains the results for the quality
analysis. The ﬁnal considerations of the paper are available in Sect. 7.

2 Machinery international trade and Latin America
In this section, we used trade data—classiﬁed according to the Harmonized System
(HS) disaggregated to the six-digit level—to analyze the machinery international
market and Latin America’s participation in it in 1996 and 2011. We also
considered the changes in trade patterns from a trade margin and product
sophistication perspective to identify modiﬁcations in Latin American countries’
trade basket composition.
2.1 Descriptive analysis: traded values
Production networks, in particular the machinery ones, are constituted mainly of
geographical agglomerations that form regional blocs of production. Three main
regional blocs are recognized for machinery production: the East Asian region, the
European Union, and NAFTA. In general, machinery trade studies focus on these
main areas, ignoring the situation in Latin America and the rest of the world. The
main reason for this fact is illustrated by Fig. 1, which shows the data for world
imports and exports of machinery. The aforementioned main areas are responsible
for the bulk of the traded values, while Latin America and the rest of the world are
responsible for a very small share.3 Another important difference is that the traded
value of parts and components is larger than the ﬁnal product in the three main
regions, while in Latin America, the traded value of the ﬁnal product is higher. This
evidence suggests a lower engagement of Latin America in machinery production
networks.
The idiosyncrasies of Latin America, a heterogeneous region composed of
countries of different sizes and governments with different political and economic
orientation, localized in a vast territory full of geographical barriers, such as the
Andes Mountains and the Amazon Forest, are possible reasons for its low level of
engagement in production networks. Another reason, identiﬁed by Moreira et al.

and Kimura (2015)

(2013), is the quality of the local infrastructure that penalizes the trade, increasing
the freight costs or simply making it impracticable at competitive prices.
Nevertheless, Fig. 2 reveals that for the period 1996–2011 parts and components
traded value increased relative to ﬁnal products. Latin American export data show
an increase in traded parts and components from 46.6 percentage points to 54.4
percentage points. Although import data reveal an increase in traded parts and
components share of just 0.5 percentage points, in terms of values this change
represents a substantial increase, given that imported machinery parts and
components value is higher than the exported machinery total value. Even though
traded values are still smaller than the three main blocs, the increase in import of
parts and components indicate that Latin America is slowly adhering to production
networks in the machinery industry. Table 1 displays the compound annual growth
rate of the machinery trade, revealing that Latin America had the highest growth
rate for total machinery export and the second highest for machinery import. In fact,
considering just the trade of parts and components, the region had the highest
growth rates, corroborating the idea that participation in machinery production
networks is growing in this region.
According to fragmentation theory, the core of a production network is
concentrated in regional agglomerations, given the reduced costs incurred in
shorter distance transport freights, reduced lead time, and the possibility of faster
coordination for the whole network (Harrigan and Venables 2004; Kimura et al.
2007). Nonetheless, the development of the internet and other communication and
coordination technologies, as well as the decrease in freight cost, has led to a
decrease in the service link costs (Jones and Kierzkowski 2005), allowing for a
growth in interactions between regional blocs. As a result, the East Asian region
increased its role as a supplier of machinery parts and components to other region’s

composition of parts and components suppliers for all ﬁve regions to verify changes
and patterns. As expected, except for NAFTA in 2011, the intra-bloc import of
machinery parts and components is dominant in the three main regions. We also
verify an increase of the East Asian share in all regions. Data for Latin America
reveal a few things: ﬁrst, the Latin American share as a supplier is irrelevant in all
regions except Latin America; second, its intra-bloc share is smaller than the shares

was the region where the share of East Asian parts and components increased the
most, a growth of more than 20 percentage points.
From the perspective of production fragmentation logic, a country purchases
more parts and components from a given region if these products have some
comparative advantage. The existing literature highlights two channels through
which access to inputs can beneﬁt a country: an efﬁciency gain in the production
process by the acquisition of cheaper and/or higher quality inputs (Amiti and
Konings 2007; Goldberg et al. 2010) and the possibility of having access to inputs
that previously could not be produced domestically or obtained from a third country
(Goldberg et al. 2009). In both cases, a gain in productivity and changes in
production pattern are expected. Based on this fact, we consider the hypothesis that
the increase in import of parts and components, especially from East Asia, should be
beneﬁcial to Latin American machinery production networks.
In the next subsection, we analyze the trade margins to identify possible trade
pattern modiﬁcations.
2.2 Descriptive analysis: the trade margins approach
The trade ﬂow can be decomposed in extensive and intensive margins, revealing
how the intensiﬁcation of trade in existing relations and the beginning or ending of
trade relations contribute to change this ﬂow. Although the intensive margin is
expected to be the main factor responsible for the changes, authors such as
Hummels and Klenow (2005) and Kehoe and Ruhl (2013) identiﬁed that in situations
of considerable trade growth the extensive margin contribution is also relevant. Our
main interest in observing the extensive margins is to identify evidence of changes
in Latin American countries’ import and export baskets.
A country’s trade relation is understood as a product–destination pair in the case
of exports and a product–supplier pair in the case of imports. Given an initial and a
ﬁnal period, if a pair is active in both periods it is classiﬁed as a continuing pair. If
country A imported (exported) a given product from (to) country B in the ﬁrst
period and then does not in the second period, but it still imports (exports) the
product in question from (to) a third country, we have an exit of supplier
(destination). If a similar situation occurs, but in the second period the product in
question is not imported (exported) from (to) any other country, then it is classiﬁed
as an exit of product. If in the second period, country A imports (exports) a product
that was not imported (exported) from (to) any other country in the ﬁrst period, then
this new relation is classiﬁed as an enter of product. If in the second period, country
A starts to import (export) from (to) country B a product that was already imported
(exported) in the ﬁrst period from (to) a third country, then this new relation is
classiﬁed as an entry of supplier (destination).
Considering only the number of relations, Fig. 4 illustrates the margins of each
Latin American country import of machinery parts and components. Mexico and
Brazil had the highest number of product–supplier active pairs in 2011, while El
Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua and Paraguay had the lowest number of active pairs.

of supplier margin had a very important contribution in all cases, signaling an
increasing integration of Latin America in the international economy.
Following Obashi and Kimura (2016), we identify the contribution that each
margin had in the trade growth. To calculate these contributions, we use the
following methodology:

i,t
the entering countries, EXPc are the exiting products, and EXCc are the exiting
countries.
Figure 5 conﬁrms that the most important contribution is the intensive margin.
Even though the supplier entry contribution is not as big as in the previous ﬁgure, it
still accounted for an important portion of the parts and components import growth,
indicating that the Latin American countries increased their diversity of parts and
margins from 1996 to 2011 (%). Source Author’s calculation, using data available from the UN Comtrade

We also observe the contribution of the extensive and intensive margins in Latin
American countries exports to verify if there were changes in the variety of exported
products and destinations. Figure 6 shows the export margins considering only the
numbers of product–destination pairs. Once again, the entry of new destinations and
the continuation of existing pairs are important margins. However, this time the
entry of new products is also important, indicating a change in the exported goods
variety. Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico already had a more developed industrial park
in 1996; consequently, their entry of products is very small. Another interesting
feature is that in some cases the exit of products and destinations is large, also
indicating a change in the export basket composition.
Next, we decompose the export growth according to its respective margins.
Figure 7 reveals different patterns. The growth in countries with more developed
industrial parks such as Argentina, Brazil, and Mexico focused on the intensive
margin (Honduras is an exception, having a similar pattern to these countries). The
entry of new products was an important margin in countries such as Ecuador,
Nicaragua, Paraguay, and Uruguay, while in other cases, the entry of new product–
destination pairs was more important. In countries such as Bolivia, El Salvador,
Peru, and Venezuela, the exit of products and destinations had an important role,
showing an export basket specialization tendency.
The previous ﬁgures offer evidence that the pattern of Latin American countries’
imports and exports changed during the studied period. We performed one
1996 to 2011. Source Author’s calculation, using data available from the UN Comtrade

predominant increase in the variety of exports to Latin American countries,

Given the economic growth of China after the WTO accession in 2001, we consider the importance of
disentangling the impacts of this country from the rest of the East Asian region. We separate the East
Asian region into two groups: a ﬁrst group composed only of China and Hong Kong (hereafter referred to
as China), and a second group composed of the other countries in the region that we address as East Asia
433 machinery parts and components and 691 machinery ﬁnal products. Source Author’s calculation,
using data available from the UN Comtrade

followed by an increase in the variety of parts and components exported to other
regions.
Given the evidence of change in the import and export pattern of Latin American
countries, in the next subsection we analyze the changes on traded products quality.
2.3 Descriptive analysis: sophistication level
Concomitant to the increase in Latin America’s machinery trade ﬂow and changes
in the structural composition of machinery parts and components suppliers, a
modiﬁcation in the trade basket composition is expected. To evaluate this change,
we used the PRODY index5 developed in Hausmann et al. (2007). According to the
authors, the PRODY ‘‘index is a weighted average of the per capita GDP of
countries exporting a given product, and thus represents the income level associated
with that product’’. In other words, this index attributes to each one of the products a
value that varies according to the share and per capita GDP of the countries that
export it. This result means that products with higher PRODY values were exported
more by developed countries, while products with lower PRODY values were

exported more by developing countries. The PRODY index can be used as a proxy
for the sophistication of the product.
Table 2 contains the PRODY index summary statistics for all products according
to the HS classiﬁcation disaggregated to the six-digit level. The index varies from
747.7 to 46,860.5, and the mean is 14,171.7. Although the index represents the
income level associated with a given product, it is hard to attribute a sense of
cardinality, making it easier to interpret as an ordinal index. In the lower part of the
table, the products were classiﬁed into three different categories.6 We observe that
non-manufactured products have the lowest PRODY index mean, while machinery
products have the highest. Additionally, the standard deviation of the machinery
goods PRODY index is the lowest, indicating that, in general, the products of this
category are more sophisticated than the others.
Next, we use the PRODY index to calculate the sophistication of the parts and
components import basket and the intra-bloc export basket. The objective is to
verify if changes in the parts and components import pattern led to changes in the
pattern of the Latin American intra-bloc trade. Figure 9 reveals that for six countries
the average sophistication degree of their machinery parts and components imports
decreased, while the rest experienced an increase in the sophistication level.
Figure 10 illustrates the changes in the sophistication of the intra-regional export
basket. We observed a decrease in the sophistication level of the ﬁnal products
export basket for seven countries, while the same occurs for just ﬁve countries in the
parts and components export basket case. Although the results are not homogeneous, we verify gains in the export basket sophistication for the majority of the
countries.
2.4 Descriptive analysis: machinery sector data
According to previous studies on machinery production networks, the machinery
industry can be classiﬁed into four different sectors: general machinery, electric
machinery, transport equipment, and precision machinery. Based on this classiﬁcation, Fig. 11 reveals Latin America’s machinery parts and components imports by
sector. We observe that electric parts and components had the biggest share in both

years, although it declines in 2011. General machinery had the second biggest share,
followed by transport equipment. Figure 12 plots the share of each sector in regional
exports of ﬁnal products and parts and components. Despite the observed increase in
export pattern with electric machinery achieving the second biggest share. A similar
movement occurred for the case of parts and components exports. Observing the
total exports share, we identify that transport equipment products were the most
exported ones inside Latin America, while electric machinery became the second
most traded in 2011. Based on the importance of these two sectors and that the study
of their heterogeneity be a common practice in the literature, we also investigate
them independently.
In view of the facts presented in this section, the change in Latin America’s
machinery trade pattern, the increase in trade ﬂows and the modiﬁcation in the
average sophistication level of the traded products, in the next sections, we present
the data and methodology employed to study the effects that changes in the
structural composition of machinery parts and components suppliers had in the
expansion of Latin American production networks and in the sophistication of the
intra-bloc export basket.

3 Data
In the economics literature, many studies have been conducted on the fragmentation
of production with different ways of deﬁning the object of study. Some scholars
employ a more comprehensive deﬁnition of production networks, including in their
analysis all inputs used, from the raw materials to the ﬁnal product. To capture all
production steps they use international input–output tables.7 On the other hand,
some scholars do not consider the raw materials in their analysis, understanding that
just the trade of parts and components used in a given industry should be analyzed.
This second group of researchers adopt a more reﬁned classiﬁcation to isolate parts
and components from ﬁnal products.8
We embrace the second view for two reasons: no international input–output data
are available for the majority of the Latin American countries, and the second
deﬁnition permits the use of more disaggregated and speciﬁc data. Considering that
the machinery industry presents a high level of complexity and uses a large number
of parts and components, we adopted this industry as our object of study.
The analysis of machinery production networks was based on the classiﬁcation of
the machinery trade in parts and components and ﬁnal products.9 The data used was
collected from the United Nations Commodity Trade Statistics Database (UN
Comtrade), classiﬁed according to the HS disaggregated to the six-digit level. The
machinery industry comprises all the goods categorized as general machinery sector
7

For example, Timmer et al. (2015) used the World Input–Output Database (WIOD), while Baldwin and
Lopez-Gonzalez (2015) employed WIOD and OECD-WTO TiVA data to analyze production networks.

8

For example, Athukorala (2005) separates manufacturing parts and components from ﬁnal products
using the SITC data, while Ando and Kimura (2005) do the same for the machinery industry using HS
data.

9

This process was performed in accordance with the classiﬁcation presented in Ando and Kimura
and precision machinery sector (HS90–92).
We consider the import of parts and components from countries that were
responsible for at least 0.01% of the international machinery trade in 2011. The
selected 89 countries are grouped in six regions.10 We deﬁne Latin America as the
group of 17 countries consisting of Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia,
Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua,
Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, and Venezuela.
The PRODY measure was employed as the qualitative measure for the export and
import basket of Latin American countries.11 We also used tariff data and the depth
of the Preferential Trade Agreements (PTA)12 to account for the level of integration
of the Latin American economies. The tariff data were collected from the World
Integrated Trade Solution (WITS)13 and the PTAs depth measures were calculated
based on Mulabdic et al. (2017) using the contents of trade agreements from the
World Bank database (Hofmann et al. 2016). Given the availability of tariff and
trade data, this study is restricted to the period from 1996 to 2011.

4 Methodology
Because the core of production networks is regionally concentrated, in this work, we
focus on the impacts that changes in the structural composition of parts and
components suppliers have on Latin America’s intra-bloc exports. For this empirical
exercise, we use a model known as the workhorse of empirical international trade
analysis: the gravity model (Baier and Bergstrand 2007). The gravity model is
distinguished by its good ﬁt and its parsimonious and tractable representation of
economic interactions among many countries, also allowing for disaggregation of
the trade in different levels of geographical organization and product classiﬁcation
(Anderson 2011).
To quantify the impact that changes in the structural composition of parts and
components suppliers had on the development of the intra-bloc machinery trade, we
follow the methodology proposed by Florensa et al. (2015), an augmented gravity
model that accounts for the effect of the import of intermediate products. The
adoption of such a framework is justiﬁed by the fact that, different from the standard
gravity framework, this version accounts for the effect that the import of parts and
10

The list containing the 89 countries divided by regions is available in the Table 8 in ‘‘Appendix’’.

We use the PRODY measures calculated by Hausmann et al. (2007). According to the authors they
‘‘constructed the PRODY measure for a consistent sample of countries that reported trade data in each of
the years 1999–2001. These indexes are the result of an average of 3 years’’ (Hausmann et al. 2007).
Because the chosen years are previous to the Chinese accession to the World Trade Organization, the
possibility of a downward bias in the ranking of the machinery goods (in particular, ﬁnal goods, given the
increase in multinationals assembling their ﬁnal products China) is minimized.
12
We thank an anonymous referee for suggesting the use of PTAs depth to implicitly control non-tariff
barriers.
13
Tariff data were classiﬁed to HS six-digit level and when necessary was converted to the HS1992
intra-bloc exports. The proposed model assumes that in the ﬁrst period, Latin
American countries can import parts and components from any region of the world.
These parts and components are employed to produce other parts and components
that in a second period will be used domestically or traded with another country.
Alternatively, they can be used to manufacture a ﬁnal product that will be consumed
domestically or traded with a third country. We assume that Latin American
production networks are created when Latin American countries use parts and
components imported from any region of the world to produce a ﬁnal product or
other parts and components that are exported to another Latin American country.
The Latin American intra-bloc trade of ﬁnal products and parts and components
in a given year is explained by the tariffs imposed by the importer country in the
same year and the exporter country imports of parts and components in the previous
year. We augment the Florensa et al. (2015) model to capture the possible effects of
the non-tariff barriers by adding a PTA depth measure. The PTA depth index
calculation follows Mulabdic et al. (2017): based on the content of the trade
agreements database, we count the number of legally enforceable provisions
covered by each agreement and normalize it between 0 and 1.
Fixed-effect dummies are used to capture all sources of unobserved heterogeneity
that are constant for each period of time, individual, and sector. Following Anderson
and van Wincoop (2003, 2004), exporter-time and importer-time dummies are
employed to control for the multilateral resistance, sector dummies control for
unobserved heterogeneities of each machinery sector, while exporter–importer
dummies are added to guard against unobserved heterogeneities on the relation of
each country pair (Baier and Bergstrand 2007). The proposed models were deﬁned
as follows:

where XFijkt and XPCijkt denote the traded value of ﬁnal products and parts and
components from country i to country j (these countries are limited to Latin
American countries only) of sector k in year t. The traded values are explained by
country i’s imports of parts and components of sector k from a given region r in year
t - 1 (M pcriktÀ1 ), the tariff imposed by the importing country j over the product of
sector k provided by country i in time t tariff jikt , the depth measure of the PTA
between country i and j in year t depthijt , exporter-time and importer-time dummies
deﬁnition of the object of study. As already mentioned, we selected a more speciﬁc
object of study, focusing on the machinery industry alone. This allows us to use
more disaggregated and detailed data, increasing the reﬁnement of the parts and
components and ﬁnal products correspondence. Additionally, we can classify
machinery industry products into four different sectors, decreasing the bias that can
result from the use of aggregated data.
Based on previous works about production fragmentation and use of imported
inputs, it is expected that the purchase of parts and components from another
country should provide some efﬁciency gain or advantage to Latin American
countries. Based on this fact, we expect that the increase in imports of parts and
components from the East Asian region should guarantee a production gain for
Latin American countries, increasing the intra-bloc machinery trade.
An important contribution of this paper is that the analysis is not limited to the
quantity impact of the import of parts and components on the intra-bloc trade; we
also propose a way of verifying quality changes. Since we know that there was a
change in the shares of machinery parts and components providers, we attempt to
evaluate if this variation also produced a modiﬁcation in the Latin American intrabloc trade pattern. Once again, it is expected that if the East Asian region is more
efﬁcient in the production of machinery parts and components, providing inputs
with higher quality and/or cheaper prices, Latin American countries should be able
to diversify and improve the quality of their intra-bloc trade basket.
To check this hypothesis, we propose a substitution of the traded values by a
trade basket sophistication index that is calculated based on the PRODY index
developed in Hausmann et al. (2007). The PRODY index can be used as a proxy for
the sophistication of the product, and according to Hausmann et al. (2007), countries
that have an export basket more similar to the developed countries tend to register
economic growth in the subsequent periods. Based on this concept and the
importance of economic growth for the development of Latin American countries,
we use the PRODY index to calculate the composition of the import basket of parts
and components (IMPY index) and the intra-bloc export basket (EXPY index). The
objective is to estimate if the imports of parts and components from speciﬁc regions
contributed or not to bring the Latin American intra-bloc export basket closer to the
developed countries. The proposed models are deﬁned as follows:

where EXPYFijkt and EXPYPCijkt denote the EXPY index attributed to the basket of
The EXPY index is calculated as the weighted average of the PRODY index of each
component of the basket of a given sector. The EXPY index attributed to the baskets
of ﬁnal products and parts and components traded inside Latin America is explained
by the IMPY index attributed to the basket of parts and components of sector k that
country i imported from a given region r in year t - 1 (IMPY pcriktÀ1 ), the depth
measure of the PTA between country i and j in year t depthijt , the tariff imposed by
the importing country j over the product of sector k provided by country i in time t
tariff jikt , the exporter-time and importer-time dummies (time is deﬁned as a 5-year
period), and the sector and the importer–exporter dummies.

5 Results: quantity analysis
A common characteristic of trade data is the existence of missing and zero trade
values. As the natural logarithm of zero does not exist, the estimated regressions do
not consider the zero trade values that are important information about the trade
pattern. The dropped data are information not used in the estimation, possibly
leading to a bias in the regression results.14 To avoid this problem, we estimate the
regressions using the pseudo-Poisson maximum likelihood (PPML) method (Santos
Silva and Tenreyro 2006). The PPML is the most accepted technique in the gravity
model literature, allowing us to account for the observations with zero trade
values.15 In addition, trade data are plagued by heteroscedasticity, consequently the
use of OLS can lead to the estimation of biased elasticities (Santos Silva and
Tenreyro 2006).
We ﬁrst estimate Eqs. (2) and (3) for the values of the pooled machinery intrabloc exports. We also consider separate estimations for the main machinery sectors:
electric machinery and transport equipment.
The ﬁrst half of Table 3 contains the results for the intra-bloc exports of
machinery ﬁnal products. The tariff coefﬁcient for the pooled data regression is
negative and statistically signiﬁcant, indicating that reductions in import tariffs of
machinery ﬁnal products are associated with increases in their intra-bloc exports.
Consequently, the advance of the regional integration in Latin America through the
decrease in the import tariffs imposed over the intra-bloc machinery trade have a
positive impact on the development of Latin American machinery production
networks. On the opposite side, the coefﬁcient for PTA depth is statistically
insigniﬁcant, showing that changes in non-tariff barriers do not affect production
networks. The variables related to the origin of the imported parts and components
reveal that an intensiﬁcation of imports from the rest of the world (ROW), East Asia
(EA), and Latin American (LA) countries, increase the intra-bloc trade of ﬁnal
products in the subsequent period. The results reveal that a 1% increase in imports
14
The share of dropped values when the OLS method is employed ranges from around 17–29% of the
total values estimated with the PPML technique.

of parts and components from LA leads to an increase of 0.53% in the intra-bloc
exports of ﬁnal products. The coefﬁcient for imports from EA is also high,
approximately 0.45%, while imports from the ROW have a smaller effect,
approximately 0.15%. On the other hand, the coefﬁcient of imports from the North
America16 and China are negative, indicating a decrease on the intra-bloc trade of
ﬁnal machinery products of 0.32 and 0.27%, respectively. Although it is not
possible to identify the exact reasons why imports from these suppliers do not
stimulate intra-bloc trade, we consider a few hypotheses. The ﬁrst is that an
important share of imported parts and components are used in domestic production
networks being consumed in the domestic market. Given the lack of data we cannot
verify this hypothesis. A second possibility is that a share of these parts and
16

This case is beyond the scope of this paper. It could also be the case that imports
from these regions are used to produce parts and components that are exported to
other Latin American countries. If that is the case, coefﬁcients will be positive in the
second half of the table, when dependent variables are parts and components
exports.
Results in the second column refer to the electric machinery trade. The import
tariff coefﬁcient is negative, indicating that a decrease of 1% in the tariffs imposed
on electric machinery parts and components imports, all ceteris paribus, stimulates
an increase of 0.12% in intra-bloc exports of electric machinery ﬁnal products. Once
again, the coefﬁcient for imports from North America is negative, indicating that a
1% increase in imports from this region causes a decrease in the intra-bloc exports
of ﬁnal electric machinery of 0.52%. Imports from the ROW also have a negative
impact of 0.24%. On the opposite side, a 1% increase in imports of electric
machinery parts and components from China promotes an intensiﬁcation of 0.22%
in the intra-bloc trade of ﬁnal products. The PTA depth coefﬁcient is statistically
signiﬁcant and indicates that deeper agreements lead to a decrease in the intraregional trade of electric machinery ﬁnal products. According to Hofmann et al.
(2016), agreements between developing countries are in general less deep and focus
more on the decrease of import tariffs, since they are still high.17 This is in
accordance with our ﬁndings that show that decreases in import tariffs are more
efﬁcient than deeper agreements in the promotion of intra-bloc electric machinery
ﬁnal products exports. Additionally, in Latin America shallow agreements embrace
more members, while deeper ones are in general bilateral agreements involving
Mexico and Central American countries. Consequently, members of shallower
agreements, such as the Mercosur, promote higher trade ﬂows among themselves
than members of deeper agreements. Lastly, according to Baier and Bergstrand
(2007), all PTAs are ‘‘phased-in’’ over time, approximately 5–10 years. Therefore,
older and shallower agreements, implemented in the 1990s, should have bigger
impacts than the deeper ones, the majority of which were implemented in 2009,
only 2 years before the end of the period studied.18
With regard to transport equipment, the results are almost all statistically
insigniﬁcant. The exception is the coefﬁcient for imports from the ROW, indicating
that a 1% increase in imports of transport equipment parts and components from this
region leads to an increase of 0.18% in intra-bloc exports of ﬁnal transport
equipment.
The second half of Table 3 displays the intra-bloc parts and components export
coefﬁcients. In this case, import tariff and PTA depth coefﬁcients are statistically
insigniﬁcant, signaling an increase in regional integration through the decrease of
the import tariffs or non-tariff barriers would not affect the production fragmentation and relocation inside Latin America. Imports of parts and components from
17
The mean of the import tariff between Latin American countries in the studied period was 6.89% for
machinery ﬁnal products and 5.64% for machinery parts and components. For the case of electric
machinery, the average import tariffs are 9.92% for ﬁnal products and 6.62% for parts and components.

coefﬁcients. As observed in Florensa et al. (2015), imports of parts and components
from these regions generate what they called a ‘‘complementary effect’’. In other
words, they stimulate production fragmentation and its relocation inside Latin
America, since parts and components imported by a Latin American country in the
ﬁrst period produce other parts and components that will be used in a third Latin
American country, promoting these countries engagement in machinery productions
networks. A 1% increase in parts and components imports from LA results in an
increase of 0.64% of the intra-bloc export of parts and components. Imports from
North America promote an increase of 0.31%, while imports from the ROW have a
smaller effect of 0.19%.
In the speciﬁc case of electric machinery, imports from EA stimulate the intrabloc trade of parts and components with a coefﬁcient of 0.39%, while imports from
European Union (EU) and North America have a negative effect. In the case of
transport equipment, the LA coefﬁcient is positive, while the North American one is
negative. Florensa et al. (2015) refer to the situation when coefﬁcients are negative
as the ‘‘substitution effect’’, because instead of enhancing the development of
production networks among Latin American countries, it promotes trade inside
domestic markets or with countries in third regions.
Evidence indicates that increases in the import of parts and components from LA
have the biggest positive impact in the creation of a Latin American machinery
production network. This result aligns with Florensa et al. (2015) and the production
fragmentation theory that states that the core of production networks is regionally
organized. Imports from North America, a region that is geographically close to
Latin America and known for engaging in back-and-forth intra-ﬁrm production
network transactions with Mexico and Central American countries, presented mixed
results. It stimulates the intra-bloc trade of machinery parts and components in
general, but decreases the trade of ﬁnal products. Conversely, the results indicate
that in the speciﬁc case of electric machineries, imports from EA and China foment
production fragmentation. This result also aligns with Florensa et al. (2015) and
Fung et al. (2015b) who veriﬁed an increase of parts and components supplies from
Asian countries supporting Latin America’s engagement in production networks.
As mentioned in Sect. 2, Latin America is an area where economic integration
still lags behind other regions of the globe. Although there are 21 different PTAs
signed by LA countries, none of them integrates the whole region. Given this fact,
we perform one extra exercise to explore the heterogeneity inside the region. Based
on economic proximity and negotiated PTAs, we classiﬁed Latin America into three
subregions: one composed of Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay, who are
members of Mercosur; a second composed of Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador, Peru,
and Venezuela who are members of the Andean Community (CAN); and a third
with the members of Central America (Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala,
Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama), Mexico and Chile.19
19
Venezuela was classiﬁed as part of CAN, because during the majority of the studied period it was a
member of it. Chile and Mexico were aggregated with Central American economies given the existence

Table 4 contains the results of machinery exports from each subregion.20 Given
the reduction in the number of observations, we consider only the pooled machinery
data results. The majority of the coefﬁcients are statistically insigniﬁcant for the
case of CAN exports. Indeed, among the three subregions, CAN is the one with the
smallest machinery trade. The results reveal that imports from LA and EA countries
enhance the intra-regional trade of ﬁnal machinery by 0.5 and 0.36%, while imports
20

components by 0.4%. In the cases of Central America, Mexico and Chile, we
observe that imports from EA, LA and North America enhance the intra-regional
trade of machinery ﬁnal products by 0.15, 0.32, and 0.42%, respectively. Imports
from these three regions and the ROW enhance the regional trade of parts and
components by 0.25, 0.45, 0.58, and 0.23%, respectively. On the opposite side,
imports from China and EU have negative effects. The results indicate that
production fragmentation in Central America, Mexico and Chile is stronger than in
CAN, with EA, LA and North America, who, in ascending order, have been
important suppliers for the regional production networks. Though composed of only
four economies, Mercosur is responsible for the biggest intra-bloc machinery trade.
The results also indicate that imports from the ROW and EA stimulate the exports
of ﬁnal products, while imports from the ROW and China enhance the exports of
parts and components inside Latin America. Coefﬁcients for EA and China are
higher than the ROW: a 1% increase in import of parts and components from EA
induced an increase of 0.66% in the intra-bloc trade of ﬁnal products compared with
0.15% for imports from the ROW, while imports from China promoted a 0.26%
increase in the intra-bloc trade of parts and components compared with 0.10% for
imports from the ROW. On the opposite side, imports from North America do not
stimulate the intra-bloc export of machinery.
We conclude that, different from Central American, Mexico and Chile,
production networks promoted by Mercosur countries depend more on imports
from China and EA, while imports from North America have a negative impact. In
this case, it seems that geographical and economic proximity still play an important
role, with North American imports fomenting the ﬁrst regions’ engagement in
production fragmentation, while in Mercosur’s case, a region more distant from
North America, the imports from EA and China are more important.

6 Results: quality analysis
Considering the wide range of machinery products and that some are more
sophisticated than the others, our next step is to examine which regions provide
parts and components that promote Latin American production networks of
products more similar to the ones produced by developed countries. Being involved
in the manufacturing process of products with higher sophistication level instead of
just buying the ﬁnal product from other regions, Latin American countries gain
access to technology, beneﬁt from positive spillover effects, and increase the
possibilities of enjoying economic growth.
The ﬁrst half of Table 5 presents the results for the intra-bloc trade of ﬁnal
products, while results for the intra-bloc trade of machinery parts and components
are in the second half. The ﬁrst notable feature is that the tariff coefﬁcient is positive
in all columns, indicating that a decrease in the import tariff leads to a decrease in
the sophistication of the machinery export basket. In other words, the export basket
becomes more similar to the developing countries. One possible interpretation for

values that are comparatively easier to be produced by developing countries were
manufactured in most of the countries and were consumed in the domestic market,
while machinery products with a higher level of sophistication were produced by
just a few countries in the region and traded inside the bloc. The import tariff
reduction allowed for an increase in the intra-bloc trade and specialization. This
phenomenon promoted a faster growth in the trade of less sophisticated products
than the sophisticated ones.
Considering parts and components suppliers, we verify that imports from the
ROW, EU, EA, LA, and North America promoted an increase in the sophistication
of the ﬁnal products traded inside Latin America. A 1% increase in North American
participation in the import basket composition, all ceteris paribus, promotes an
increase of 0.06% in the quality of the intra-bloc export basket, while imports from
imports just from LA and North America had a positive effect in the electric
machinery sector, while the coefﬁcients for imports from other regions are
statistically insigniﬁcant. Increases of 1% in imports from North America promote
an increase of 0.07% in the quality of ﬁnal electric machinery intra-bloc export
basket, while imports from LA promote an increase of 0.06%. Transport equipment
coefﬁcients were all statistically insigniﬁcant. In the second half of Table 5, we
verify similar results for the case of pooled machinery data. North American
imports promote an increase of 0.1% in the quality of the parts and components
export basket, while imports from the EU and EA promote an increase of 0.04%
each. In column 5, the coefﬁcients are slightly different, revealing that imports only
from China promote a 0.04% increase in the intra-bloc export basket of electric
machinery parts and components, while imports from EA have a negative effect.
Once again, transport equipment coefﬁcients are statistically insigniﬁcant.
Results in this section partially support the hypothesis that an increase in imports
of parts and components from Asian countries promotes an increase in the quality of
the intra-bloc export basket. Nevertheless, imports from EU and North America had
a bigger positive effect. Table 6 presents the PRODY mean of the import basket
from each region in 1996 and 2011, revealing that import baskets from EU and
North America were still composed of products with a high sophistication level.
Given the increase in Asian product imports share in the detriment of imports from
both regions, we can conclude that imports from EU and North America
concentrated in higher sophistication products, while Asia supplied products with
a slightly lower level of sophistication at very competitive prices. Another
interesting feature is that, although the share of imports from the ROW is the
smallest one, imports from this region are concentrated in products with a very high
level of sophistication.
As in the previous section, we perform a similar exercise considering the exports
of countries classiﬁed in three different subregions to explore their differences.

from the ROW, EU, and EA promote an increase in the sophistication of the ﬁnal
products this region produced and exported inside LA. Conversely, imports from
North America and China have a surprisingly negative effect. The pattern does not
change even when intra-bloc exports of parts and components are considered. The
only difference is that LA imports have a negative impact. Table 6 reveals that from
1996 to 2011 the PRODY mean of this subregion import basket decreased,
coefﬁcient is positive and statistically signiﬁcant only in this case comprising the
Central American countries Chile and Mexico, a subregion with the deepest PTAs.
For the Andean Community members, imports of parts and components from EU
have a negative impact, while imports from EA and North America increase the
sophistication of the machinery ﬁnal products they export inside Latin America.
When intra-bloc exports of parts and components are considered, imports from the
ROW assume a positive coefﬁcient. Although Table 6 revealed no decrease in the
PRODY mean from 1996 to 2011, after econometrically controlling all variables,
the model reveals a negative effect on intra-bloc exports of parts and components in
the cases of imports from China, EA and EU.
Increases in EA and the ROW participation in Mercosur’s import basket
composition have a positive impact on Mercosur members’ exports of machinery
ﬁnal products and parts and components, while North American participation in the
import basket have a negative impact.
These results indicated that depending on the subregion, the origin of the imports
can have a positive or negative effect on the sophistication level of the machinery
exports inside Latin America. In general, imports from EA and the ROW had
positive effects, while imports from North America and China had negative impacts.
However, when we consider all Latin American countries, we verify positive
contributions from North American imports. The results indicate that in the case of
imports from China, the effect on the intra-bloc exports sophistication level were
not positive as expected, revealing that its exports to Latin America were still
composed of cheaper and less sophisticated parts and components. The exception is
in the speciﬁc case of electric machinery, where imports from China increased the
sophistication of the intra-bloc exports of parts and components.

7 Final considerations
In this paper, we investigated how the changes in the structural composition of Latin
America’s suppliers of machinery parts and components affected the development
of Latin American regional production networks. In our analysis, we considered a
quantity and a quality dimension of the impact of these imports.
In the ﬁrst part of the paper, the descriptive analysis indicated a growth in the import
of parts and components from all regions of the world. However, we observed that the
growth in imports from the East Asian region was higher, resulting in a change in the
structural composition of the suppliers. Concomitant with this composition change, we
also veriﬁed a modiﬁcation in the sophistication level on the intra-bloc exports. In the
second part of the paper, we proceeded with an econometric analysis to identify from
which regions the import of parts and components contributed more to develop
production networks inside Latin America and increase the sophistication level of the
traded products. The quantity analysis provided evidence that Latin American
production networks increased during the studied period, and they were fomented by
import of machinery parts and components from the ROW, LA, EA, and North
North America stimulated the intra-bloc trade of machinery parts and components in
general, decreasing the trade in speciﬁc machinery sectors. The expected result that the
increase in imports from EA and China fomented production networks inside Latin
America was conﬁrmed for the speciﬁc case of electric machineries. Conversely,
imports of parts and components from North America did not stimulate the intra-bloc
trade of machineries ﬁnal products and parts and components for the two speciﬁc
sectors analyzed.
Exploring subregional heterogeneities, we identiﬁed that imports from North
America had the highest positive impact in intra-bloc exports in the cases of the
exports from Central America, Chile and Mexico subregions, as well as the Andean
Community. Imports from EA and China had the highest positive effects in the case
of exports from Mercosur countries. It is possible that geographical and economic
proximity played an important role in this result, with North American imports
fomenting the ﬁrst two regions’ engagement in production fragmentation, while
imports from EA and China were more important for Mercosur members.
Considering the second dimension studied, the sophistication of the products traded
in Latin America’s regional production networks, the results provided evidence that
partially supported the hypothesis that increases in imports of parts and components
from Asian countries promote an increase in the quality of the intra-bloc export basket.
The EA coefﬁcient was positive for the pooled machinery data in Latin America and
almost all subregions, while imports from China increased the sophistication of intrabloc exports of electric machinery parts and components. The coefﬁcients for
subregional pooled machinery data imports from China were negative, revealing that its
exports to Latin America were still composed of cheaper and less sophisticated parts
and components. The results from imports from North America were mixed, with
negative coefﬁcients in the subregional cases and positive coefﬁcients when all Latin
American countries were analyzed.
The ﬁndings of this paper indicate that Latin American governments should
consider the possibility of being more proactive in the development of regional
policies to facilitate the import and use of machinery parts and components. The
heterogeneity between subregions indicates that countries from Mercosur could
beneﬁt more from imports from the EA and China to foment the expansion of
regional production networks and the increase in the sophistication level of the
machinery products traded inside Latin America, while North America appears as a
natural and better option for the other countries. Moreover, Latin American
countries could take advantage of the internalization of some machinery production
steps to engage in machinery production networks and decrease the imports of
machinery ﬁnal products from third regions. These initial policies can proportionate
economic growth and other positive spillover effects. In the medium and long term,
these strategies could help Latin American countries overcome the lack of
competitiveness in given machinery products and enhance the region’s participation
in the international machinery trade.
