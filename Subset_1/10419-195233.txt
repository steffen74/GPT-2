In recent years, Latin America has made remarkable progress in the reduction of
poverty and inequality. Between 2000 and 2013, the percentage of the population
living on less than $2.5 per capita per day decreased from 28.8 to 15.9 %, while the
share of the population living on less than $4 dropped from 46.3 to 29.7 %. Over the
same period, the region has also managed to reduce its unfortunately distinctive
inequality: the Gini coefﬁcient of the income distribution fell from 0.57 to 0.51.
These improvements were largely driven by sustained economic growth, which
led to an expansion of the middle class.1 However, despite these positive trends, the
region is still home to 92 million extreme poor and 77 million moderate poor. In
addition, most of those that exited poverty joined the vulnerable class and are still at
substantial risk of falling into poverty (Fig. 1).
The trends in the incidence and depth of poverty, however, do not fully capture
poverty dynamics, i.e., its duration and how often families enter and exit poverty.
This information is very important for the design of effective social safety nets,
particularly as far as targeting and recertiﬁcation are concerned.2 Frequent
movements in and out of poverty imply the need for ﬂexible safety net entry and
exit rules.
The analysis of poverty dynamics and income mobility in developing countries
has received relatively limited attention, largely due to the lack of adequate
longitudinal data.3 Recently, Ferreira et al. (2013) and Vakis et al. (2015) have
analyzed intra-generational mobility in Latin America, with a focus, respectively,
on the middle class and the chronic poor. Their analysis is based on the synthetic
panel methodology developed by Dang et al. (2014), which is the same we employ
in this paper. The two works construct two-period transition matrices [1995–2010 in
Ferreira et al. (2013), 2004–2012 in Vakis et al. (2015)] and deﬁne the chronic poor
as those that were poor in both years. The analysis only captures mobility from the
ﬁrst period to the last period, and not yearly mobility in between the two.

Targeting is the process of identiﬁcation of poor and vulnerable beneﬁciaries, as opposed to universal
entitlement to beneﬁts. Recertiﬁcation is the periodic veriﬁcation of beneﬁciaries’ living standards, to
assess whether they still qualify for receiving the beneﬁts.

et al. (2013), Vakis et al. (2015). What is missing in this literature is the analysis of poverty or income
dynamics with long panels made of consecutive years. Robles and Saenz (2015) have started to ﬁll this
gap; using synthetic panels (similar to those employed in this paper) and a discrete-time hazard model,
they identify the factors associated with long-term poverty and exit from poverty in a sample of Latin

Consequently, it depicts the vulnerable and the middle class as consolidated in their
position (with a low probability of experiencing poverty).
In this paper, we generate 10-year synthetic panels for a large sample of Latin
American countries, and use them to estimate yearly movements in and out of
poverty from 2003 to 2013. We provide a novel classiﬁcation of households based
on poverty duration, which distinguishes chronic poor, transient poor, future poor,
and never poor. The future poor include those that initially belonged to the
vulnerable, middle, and high-income classes, and experienced poverty at any time
over the following decade.
We ﬁnd that 65 % of the vulnerable (i.e., those with daily income between $4 and
10), and 14 % of those in the middle class (with daily income between $10 and 50)
of 2003, experienced poverty at least once during the period 2004–13. At the same
time, chronic poverty remains widespread, accounting for 91 and 50 % of extreme
and moderate poverty, respectively. Differences between rural and urban areas are
substantial. Urban areas, which are now home to most moderate poor and
vulnerable, are characterized by higher (particularly upward) income mobility.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 deﬁnes poverty and
vulnerability, and describes the data and the methodology employed for constructing synthetic panels and forecasting poverty dynamics. Section 3 presents the trends
in poverty reduction and shows that the Latin American region is highly
heterogeneous in the stage and speed of the socioeconomic transition towards the
middle class. Section 4 analyzes poverty dynamics, including transition matrices
and poverty duration, and discusses household characteristics of chronic and
transient poor. Section 5 highlights the main differences between urban and rural
poverty. Section 6 concludes summarizing key ﬁndings and policy implications.
and recertiﬁcation processes.4
Six annexes provide additional information on data, methods, sensitivity
analyses, and country results. Annex 1 lists the data sources. Annex 2 summarizes
the existing literature comparing results from genuine panel data with nonparametric, parametric, and point estimate synthetic-panel methods. Annex 3 shows
the bounds of selected estimates, providing a visual representation of the quality of
our results. Annex 4 presents sensitivity analyses of key chronic poverty results to
the adoption of alternative poverty lines. Annex 5 shows that the variation in the
share of urban population is limited between 2003 and 2013, which is necessary for
the validity of the rural/urban breakdown of the dynamic analyses based on the
pseudo panel methodology. Finally, Annex 6 presents country-speciﬁc poverty
proﬁles.

2 Data and methodology5
We look at poverty through two lenses, one that focuses on depth and the other on
duration. The former is static, and analyzes a picture of poverty through the value of
daily per-capita income (expressed in 2005 dollars adjusted to reﬂect purchasing
power parity). It divides the population in ﬁve groups: (i) the extreme poor, with
income below $2.5; (ii) the moderate poor, between $2.5 and 4; (iii) the vulnerable,
´
between $4 and 10; (iv) the middle class, between $10 and 50 [as in Lopez-Calva
´
and Ortiz-Juarez (2011)]; and (v) the high-income class, above $50.
The $2.5 line corresponds to the median of the ofﬁcial extreme poverty lines in
Latin American countries (CEDLAS and World Bank 2012), and has already been
used in regional studies (World Bank 2014). It is higher than the international
extreme poverty line of $1.25 used by Ravallion et al. (2008), which corresponds to
the mean of the ofﬁcial extreme poverty lines of the 15 poorest countries in the
world. The use of a higher line reﬂects the relatively more advanced stage of
socioeconomic development (and the higher price levels) of the Latin American
region. Similar considerations hold for the $4 poverty line. The vulnerable class is
´
´
deﬁned by Lopez-Calva and Ortiz-Juarez (2011), as having a per capita daily
income between $4 and 10, which is empirically observed to imply a probability
greater than 10 % of falling into poverty.
The second lens is dynamic and focuses on the duration of poverty. It divides the
population in four groups: (i) the chronic poor, that are poor (either extreme or
4

We refer to social safety nets as the systems of social protection for the poor and vulnerable. In the
Inter-American Development Bank Strategic Framework Document on Social Protection and Poverty,
this is deﬁned as ‘‘(i) efﬁcient redistributive programs that contribute to human capital development; and
(ii) delivery of services for social inclusion, in particular those aimed at early childhood development and
at-risk youth’’ (IDB 2014). The ﬁndings of this paper are particularly relevant for the design and
implementation of redistributive programs, such as conditional cash transfers (CCTs), whose duration and
level of beneﬁts should depend on poverty duration and depth.

Non-technical readers can skip this section with no prejudice to their ability to understand the rest
decade;6 (ii) the transient poor, that are poor in the ﬁrst year, and again in four or
less years over the following decade; (iii) the future poor, that are either vulnerable,
middle class, or high income in the ﬁrst year of analysis, but experience poverty in
at least 1 year during the following 10 years; (iv) the never poor, who are always
above the $4 poverty line.
Conditioning the deﬁnition of chronic and transient poverty on being poor in the
ﬁrst year guarantees that the sum of extreme and moderate poverty equals the sum
of chronic and transient poverty. In other words, the incidence of poverty does not
change, no matter if one looks at it through the lenses of depth or through those of
duration.
The analysis focusing on the static deﬁnition of poverty is based on observed
micro-data from 216 cross-sectional household surveys collected between 2000 and
2013 in 18 Latin American countries (see Annex 1).7 These data are from IDB’s
Harmonized Data Bank of Household Surveys from Latin America and the
Caribbean (also known as IDB’s Sociometro). Regional estimates of the incidence
of poverty are obtained by imputing missing values for years with no survey, then
calculating population-weighted averages of country estimates.
The data are representative both at the national level and at the urban–rural level,
with the exception of Argentina, Uruguay, and Venezuela. In Argentina, the
household survey is only urban. In Uruguay, rural areas have been surveyed only
since 2006; we restrict the analysis to urban areas to ensure comparability over the
period 2000–2013. In Venezuela, since 2004, the survey does not contain a variable
that allows separating rural and urban areas.
Given the unavailability of real-panel data sets, in which the same households are
surveyed across time, the analysis of poverty duration is based on the construction
of synthetic panels a la Dang et al. (2014).8 This method was originally designed to
analyze transitions in and out of poverty based on two (or more) rounds of crosssectional data. In addition, the literature, so far, has focused on proving the
reliability of the methodology (Cruces et al. 2011; Fields and Viollaz 2013; Haynes
et al. 2013). Our objective is slightly different, as we aim to investigate poverty
duration, or more speciﬁcally in how many years a family has been poor over a
decade. For this purpose, we calculate yearly point estimates of per-capita income
based on yearly cross-sectional data.9
The sample is made of families surveyed in the ﬁrst year (t = 0). For each of the
following 10 years (s = 1,10), we estimate per-capita income using time-invariant

6

The 5-year threshold, like any alternative threshold, is somehow arbitrary. However, the results
presented in this paper are generally robust to the adoption of alternative values.

7

These are the 18 countries that regularly execute household surveys and share their databases with the
IDB. We lament not being able to include Caribbean countries, for which such data is not available.

8

Other synthetic or pseudo-panel approaches are those that track cohorts of individuals or households
over repeated cross-sectional surveys (Deaton 1985), and those that recover the stochastic process from
cross sectional data and generate individual income dynamics (Bourguignon et al. 2004).

9

We follow Canavire and Robles (2013), who, using this kind of panels and non-parametric duration
residuals.10 The methodology assumes a linear structure of the income equation,
and is based on the following two assumptions: (i) households do not change, which
ensures that time-invariant variables observed in t = 0 can be used to estimate
income in t = s, and (ii) the correlation of the error terms across time (et¼0 and et=s)
is not negative. This is a reasonable assumption given that income shocks show
persistence over time, and factors leading to a negative correlation of income over
time are unlikely to apply to all households at the same time. The methodology
requires estimating the following equations:
yi;t ¼ b0t xi;t þ ei;t

for t ¼ 0; 10

ð1Þ

i.e., for the ﬁrst period and for the following 10 years, where yi,t is the logarithm of
household i’s per-capita income at time t, and xi,t is a vector of variables measuring
household i’s characteristics at time t. Our speciﬁcation of the model includes
variables typically employed in the literature (Dang et al. 2014; Cruces et al. 2011),
plus statistically signiﬁcant variables at the regional level. The vector x contains the
following variables:
(i)
(ii)

(iii)
(iv)

Household head characteristics: sex, age, age squared, years of schooling,
years of schooling squared, and agricultural work;
Region (ﬁrst-level administrative country subdivision) characteristics:
average years of schooling of the household heads, and proportion of
workers in agriculture;
Geographic controls: rural–urban residence;
Retrospective regressors at regional level in the initial year (2003):
inequality (standard deviation of log income), extreme poverty headcount
($2.5 a day), average per capita income, average household size, and
average years of schooling of the household heads.

^
^
The regressions produce 11 estimates of vectors b and e (bt and et , one for each
^
time period). They also produce 11 estimates of the error term variance (ret ). These
parameters are used to produce the synthetic-panel estimates of yearly per-capita
income.
Following Cruces et al. (2011), Fields and Viollaz (2013), and Haynes et al.
(2013), we use the ‘‘non-parametric’’ version of the method, i.e., we make no
assumptions on the structural form of the joint distribution of the errors terms. Two
extreme assumptions on the non-parametric time correlation of the error terms lead
to a lower and upper bound estimate of per-capita income mobility. At one extreme,
one can assume zero correlation between et¼0 and et=s, i.e., that the two error terms
are independent from each other. The logarithm of per capita income of household
i in t = s (^U ) is estimated as follows:
yi;t¼s

10
Dang et al. (2014) and Cruces et al. (2011) show that the method performs well irrespective of the
forecasting direction, i.e. that estimates of mobility are very similar if one predicts per-capita income in
~
^i;t¼s ^
yU ¼ bt¼s xi;t¼0 þ ei;t¼s

ð2Þ

^
~
where the apex U indicates uncorrelated error terms, and ei;t¼s is the mean of 50
random draws (with replacement) from the vector of estimated residuals in t = s. At
the other extreme, one can assume perfect correlation between et¼0 and et=s. Under
this assumption, the logarithm of per capita income of household i in t = s (^C ) is
yi;t¼s
estimated as follows:
0

^i;t¼s ^
yC ¼ bt¼s xi;t¼0 þ c^i;t¼0
e

ð3Þ

where the apex C indicates correlated error terms, ei;t¼0 is (the time-invariant)
^
^
household i’s empirical error term estimated in t = 0, and c ¼ ret¼0 =ret¼s . is a scale
factor.
Dang et al. (2014) and Cruces et al. (2011) show that: (i) Eq. (2) produces upperbound estimates of income mobility, due to the high variation in the error term, and
overestimates people’s movements in and out of poverty; (ii) Eq. (3) produces
lower-bound estimates of income mobility, due to the constant error term, and
underestimates poverty transitions; and (iii) the average of (2) and (3) approximates
well the observed income mobility, providing a satisfactory estimation of
movements in and out of poverty. This last point is proved empirically by
comparing synthetic-panel estimates of mobility with those observed in genuine
panel data. We, therefore, calculate point estimates of per-capita income of the
households in the synthetic-panel as follows:11Recently, Dang and Lanjouw (2013)
have developed a point estimate synthetic panel approach, which generalizes the use
of non-parametric and parametric methods to produce point estimates of poverty
transitions. This could have been used, as alternative to Eq. (4), to produce the
estimates of poverty duration presented in this paper. We preferred to rely on
Eq. (4), because the two methods have been shown to be empirically equivalent in
terms of accuracy, and because Dang and Lanjouw (2013) indicate that the pointestimate methodology is most accurate when short time periods are analyzed. The
existing literature comparing results from genuine panel data with non-parametric,
parametric, and point estimate synthetic-panel methods is summarized in Annex 2.

As a result, our analysis of income mobility is based on income observed in 2003
along with income estimated for the years between 2004 and 2013. The quality of the
predictions is essential to guarantee that results are credible. As is usual practice, we
carefully ensured the quality of the ﬁt (value of R-squared, signiﬁcance of coefﬁcients,
over-ﬁtting). In Annex 3, we show for selected countries that the upper and lower
bounds of predicted incomes produce poverty rates that are very close to the rates
11

Dang et al. (2014) suggest that standard errors for the bounds can be estimated by bootstrapping. This
involves bootstrap resampling from the original cross-sections while accounting for survey weights
(footnote 14). Similarly, we could obtain standard errors for our point estimates by complementing Dang
of chronic poverty, transient poverty, and future poverty in selected countries.
Our methodology can only be applied to 12 countries that have household survey
data for each year between 2003 and 2013 (Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Costa
Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Honduras, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, El
Salvador, and Uruguay). Regional numbers were obtained pooling micro-data from
the 12 countries and using survey weights.12

3 Static analysis: an heterogeneous and still vulnerable region
Latin America is a very heterogeneous region in terms of the stage of
socioeconomic transition, deﬁned as the process of transition out of poverty
towards the middle class. Countries such as Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay, are at an
advanced stage, being mainly made of middle and high-income class (with the
incidence of poverty around 10 %). On the other hand, countries such as Guatemala
and Honduras, are at the earliest stages: almost half of their population still lives in
extreme poverty, and the incidence of overall poverty exceeds 65 % (Table 1).
One feature, however, is common to all countries: the large size of the vulnerable
class. This represents in most cases 30–40 % of the population, suggesting that an
important share of the population remains at substantial risk of falling into poverty.
Countries with low poverty rates and large middle classes are no exception. In these
countries, the vulnerable class is the back end of the socioeconomic transition; while
in the poorest countries, the vulnerable class leads the way.
Country heterogeneity is also high in the speed of the socio-economic transition.
For example, Colombia and Ecuador reduced the incidence of poverty by more than
25 percentage points (pp), and expanded their middle and upper classes by more
than 15 pp (Table 1). In contrast, progress was sluggish in Mexico and Dominican
Republic, despite the fact that these countries started from poverty headcounts
around 40 %.
Table 2 summarizes the region’s heterogeneity by classifying the Latin American
countries based on the stage and speed of their socioeconomic transition. In the
countries in the upper-left cell, for example, Nicaragua and El Salvador, the poor
still represents the largest share of the population, and poverty reduction has been
relatively slow (less than 25 % between 2000 and 2013). These are the countries
with the highest need for reforming and/or expanding the social safety net, as
poverty is widespread and resilient. These are also the countries with less ﬁnancial
resources for its implementation, so efﬁciency should be at the top of their policy
agenda.

Brazil does not have a household survey for 2010. In order to include it in the dynamic analysis, we
considered mobility over the period 2002–2013. It is important to highlight the caveat that our dynamic
analysis is based on twelve countries with available data. Among the excluded countries is Mexico, which
accounts for an important share of the population of the region. The exclusion of Mexico is due to the fact
that the Encuesta Nacional sobre Ingresos y Gastos de los Hogares is carried out every two years, while
the Encuesta Nacional de Ocupacion y Empleo is yearly but has been nationally representative only since

4 Dynamic analysis: poverty is still largely chronic
Income mobility between 2003 and 2013 was considerable. Poverty reduction was
the net effect of many exiting poverty, while fewer were falling back. Upward
mobility was particularly high for those that started in moderate poverty.
Most of the moderate poor rose to the vulnerable class, and a few (6 %) made it
to the middle class (Table 3).13 In contrast, 73 % of those that were initially extreme
poor were still poor after a decade, although many enjoyed less severe poverty and
another quarter rose to the vulnerable class. As may be expected (as they started
from higher initial living standards), also the vulnerable enjoyed less upper
mobility. Only 28 % of them rose to the middle class, while 62 % remained in the
initial income category and 10 % fell into poverty.
Chronic poverty was widespread among both the extreme and the moderate poor.
Many of those that were initially moderate poor, despite enjoying a high likelihood
of rising to the vulnerable class in 2013, were poor in at least 5 years over the period
2004–2013. This may be explained by an ascending trajectory that only rose above
the poverty line in the last part of the period of analysis.
On average, 91 % of extreme poverty were chronic (Table 4), with very little
country heterogeneity (Fig. 2). In almost all countries with available data, about
90 % or more of the extreme poor in 2003 remained poor in at least ﬁve of the
following 10 years. The only exceptions were Argentina and Uruguay, for which
data are urban only.
More surprisingly, also half of the moderate poor in 2003 was chronically poor.14
This has important implications for the design and implementation of the social
safety nets. In particular, it implies that long-term interventions are not only needed
for the extreme poor, but also for an important share of those in moderate poverty.

Fig. 2 Chronic poverty in Latin American countries (2003–2013)

An important share of the vulnerable and, more surprisingly, of the middle class
experienced poverty over the period 2004–13. More precisely, 65 % of the
vulnerable group and 14 % of the middle class of 2003 were poor at least once over
the following decade. We call these families ‘‘future poor’’, a group whose share
ranged from 10 % of the population in Argentina to 38 % in Costa Rica (Fig. 3).
Finally, the share of the population that was never poor ranged from 8 % in
Honduras to 57 % in Uruguay (Fig. 3).
The identiﬁcation of the chronic and transient poor in the samples of 2003 allows
investigating the household characteristics that are associated with different poverty
durations. In other words, it allows studying who are the chronic poor, how they
differ from the transient poor and, for comparison, from the non-poor. We address
these questions by looking at Paraguay and Honduras, two countries at different
stages of the socio-economic transition.
Household characteristics of the chronic poor broadly mimic those that, in the
literature, are commonly associated with extreme poverty. They include larger
household size, more children, lower levels of education, more engagement in selfemployment, less wage employment, and residence in rural areas. Table 5 reports
average household characteristics by dynamic poverty status in Paraguay and
Honduras. Despite a few differences between the two countries, most patterns are
common and the similarities are striking. In both countries, for example, chronically
poor households had no member with complete tertiary education. In Honduras,
they did not even have any member with complete secondary education; while in
Paraguay, only one in six chronically poor households had one member with this
level of schooling. Their likelihood to live in rural areas was ten times higher than
among the non-poor. Self-employment decreased and wage employment grew as
one moved from chronic poverty to non-poverty. The low level of human capital
and the remote location suggest that, at least among the chronic poor, the graduation

5 Differences between urban and rural areas
The region has undergone a process of urbanization, which has been slowing down
in recent years. The urban share of the population has been growing from 49 % in
1960 to 80 % in 2013, and is expected to reach 83 % in 2025 (ECLAC 2013). In our
sample of countries, this ﬁgure has increased from 72 % in 2000 to 74 % in 2013
(Table 6, panel B). In this context, it is extremely important to understand the
different urban–rural trends in poverty reduction, as when it comes to poverty, cities
and countryside remain two worlds apart.15
Extreme and overall poverty have decreased substantially in both urban and rural
areas. Yet, in the latter, one-third of the population still lives in extreme poverty,
and the incidence of total poverty exceeds 50 % (Table 6, panel A).
The growth of a middle class is an eminently urban phenomenon. In rural areas,
poverty reduction has been accompanied by an expansion of the vulnerable class,
and only 13 % of the population had per-capita income above $10 in 2013. In
contrast, the size of the vulnerable class remained fairly constant in urban areas.
This is where the middle class expanded more rapidly (by over 10 pp).
As a result, the rural nature of poverty has intensiﬁed, with a substantial increase of
the share of poor living in rural areas. While in 2000 the rural areas were home to 54 %
of the extreme poor and 30 % of the moderate poor, these ﬁgures increased to 58 and
15
It is relevant to acknowledge that the term urban refers to very different sizes of human settlements
(Satterthwaite 2010), that may range from as few as 2500 to as many as several million inhabitants.
only the high-income class became more urban during the period of analysis.
In 2013, the majority of the extreme poor lived in urban areas only in four
countries (Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Dominican Republic). In contrast, with few
exceptions, moderate poverty was fairly equally distributed between urban and rural
areas (Fig. 4). This suggests that long-term social safety net programs are best
suited for rural areas, while short-term interventions are equally needed in urban and
rural areas.
In the near future, in urban areas, poverty is expected to leave way to a rising
middle class (Fig. 5). This forecast is obtained by combining economic growth and
demographic projections with the estimated growth elasticity of poverty. While the
size of the vulnerable class will remain fairly stable (at around 40 % of the urban
population), by 2025 the incidence of urban poverty is expected to fall to 13 %. The
middle class will rise to represent 42 % of the urban population.
In contrast, the growth of the middle class will be slow in rural areas. Poverty
will be mostly replaced by vulnerability. The vulnerable class is expected to become
the single largest group in 2021, and grow to 47 % of the rural population in 2025.
Failing to account for substantial rural to urban migration may bias the results of
the poverty dynamic analysis based on the pseudo-panel methodology (which
assumes that household characteristics, including residence in rural or urban areas,
are constant over time). For example, one may overestimate the number of poverty
episodes in rural areas, if some rural families have migrated to urban areas and have
managed, through migration, to transition to the vulnerable class. The direction of
the bias will depend on who migrates (usually not the poorest) and how migration
affects their income.
In Annex 5, we analyze the variation in the proportion of urban population over the
period 2003–2013. We show that its magnitude is small, and does not threaten the
validity of our ﬁndings. This result is consistent with the slowdown in the process of
urbanization documented in CELADE—Population Division of ECLAC (2015).
The urban and rural poverty dynamics analyses conﬁrm that most of the mobility
out of poverty took place in urban areas. In the cities, 35 % of the extreme poor and

Fig. 5 Poverty, vulnerability, and middle class in Latin America (2000–2025), region aggregate

73 % of the moderate poor in 2003 had exited poverty after 10 years, against only
15 and 53 % in rural areas (Table 7). A similar pattern can be observed for upward
mobility from the vulnerable class. Symmetrically, the risk of falling from the
middle class to the vulnerable class or into poverty was more than double in rural
than in urban areas (44 versus 21 %). This may also be due to the differential urban–
rural impacts of the world recession in the second part of the period of analysis.
Rural areas are characterized by high incidence of chronic poverty and future
poverty. 99 % of the extreme poor and 78 % of those that were moderate poor in
2003 experienced chronic poverty between 2004 and 2013. Furthermore, 86 % of
the vulnerable and 37 % of the middle class were poor at least once during the
period of analysis. The picture is relatively rosier in urban areas, where ‘‘only’’
86 % of extreme poverty and 42 % of moderate poverty were chronic, and where
‘‘only’’ 62 % of the vulnerable experienced at least one episode of poverty (Fig. 6).
Cross-country analysis shows that Ecuador and Panama present the widest gap
between rural and urban areas, a result that is driven by the highly transient nature of
urban moderate poverty. Variability is limited in the percentage of extreme poor that
are chronic poor, both in rural and urban areas. More differences emerge when
looking at the percentage of moderate poor that experience chronic poverty. This is,
particularly, the case in urban areas. While in El Salvador 71 % of urban moderate
poor experience chronic poverty over the following decade, the same happens to
only one every ﬁve urban moderate poor in Ecuador and Panama. This indicates that
in these countries, urban moderate poverty is particularly transient (Fig. 7).

6 Conclusions and implication for the design and implementation
of social safety nets
In the absence of information on poverty dynamics, development practitioners
frequently assume that extreme poverty is chronic and rural, while moderate poverty
is transient and urban. Similarly, they tend to expect that the vulnerable are at risk of
falling into poverty, while the middle class has reached a safe place and no longer

Fig. 7 Urban and rural chronic poverty in Latin American countries (2003–2013)

In this paper, we construct synthetic panels and analyze poverty dynamics for a
large sample of Latin American countries, with the aim to provide policy makers
and development practitioners (engaged in project design) with estimates of the
duration of poverty. While the availability of real long panel data would allow
reﬁning and deepening the analysis, we believe that our results constitute a useful
proxy and hope they will stimulate further data collection and research. Our analysis
contributes to debunking a few common assumptions.
First, we show that chronic poverty is widespread also among the moderate poor.
This type of poverty, characterized by long duration, accounts for 91 % of extreme
poverty and, surprisingly, 50 % of moderate poverty. As expected, chronic poverty
is more frequent in rural areas, where 99 % of the extreme poor and as many as
78 % of the moderate poor are chronic poor.
Second, we show that also the middle class is still exposed to a substantial risk of
falling back into poverty. More speciﬁcally, we ﬁnd that 14 % of those that
belonged to the middle class in 2003 experienced at least one poverty episode
during the following decade.
Our results differ from those of Ferreira et al. (2013) and Vakis et al. (2015),
although they are based on the application of a similar synthetic panel methodology.
These authors analyze mobility between two periods only, and ﬁnd that the
vulnerable and the middle class are more consolidated in their status. For example,
Ferreira et al. (2013, Table 4.1) estimate that only 2.7 % of the vulnerable and
0.5 % of the middle class fall back into poverty.
Our ﬁndings have important implications for the design and implementation of
social safety nets. First, they suggest that interventions that target the rural poor and
the urban extreme poor need to adopt a long-term perspective. The frequent
recertiﬁcation of the beneﬁciaries might not be needed and, probably, represents a
loss of administrative and ﬁnancial resources.
Second, our ﬁndings suggest that interventions that target the urban moderate poor
satisfactorily. The Brazilian model based on declared income may represent a better
alternative, if it can be coupled with frequent recertiﬁcation and electronic audits of
eligibility based on crossing information from the roster of beneﬁciaries with other
sources of administrative data (e.g., social security contributions, ownership of assets).
Third, we show that the chronic poor have extremely low levels of human capital
and live in rural areas with limited opportunity of wage employment. These are key
factors for escaping poverty. Consequently, our ﬁndings suggest that, at least for this
group, graduation strategies aimed at increasing income-generation capacity have
low probabilities of success.16
Finally, the ﬁnding that both the vulnerable and the middle class are likely to
experience poverty in the future implies that the social safety nets remain relevant
for many that are currently out of poverty.17
A caveat is worth mentioning. Our dynamic analysis is based on 12 countries for
which data are available. Further work is needed to incorporate results for more
countries and increase the representativeness of our ﬁndings.

Annex 1: Data sources
IDB’s Harmonized Data Bank of Household Surveys from Latin America and the
Caribbean (also known as IDB’s Sociometro) contains harmonized household data
sets for Latin American and Caribbean countries starting from the late 1980s.
Variable names, deﬁnitions, and contents are kept constant across countries and
time. Table 8 shows the number of data sets used for the preparation of this paper.
Although it is well known that per-capita consumption is a better proxy for wellbeing, we use per-capita income, because few countries in the region routinely
conduct surveys with a consumption module, while all of them include questions on
income. We calculate per-capita income by dividing total household income by the
number of household members, without using any adult equivalence scale.
Income components are reported after-tax whenever possible. Extraordinary
income sources are not considered. Similarly, we do not include the implicit rent
from owned or occupied housing, because not all countries capture the information

we do not make any imputation for missing, null or outlying values in addition to

own model. They show that the estimates based on the average of the bounds
(Eq. (4)) approximate well the estimates based on genuine panel data, irrespective
of the length of the period analyzed (2 years in Peru, versus 10 in Chile), the width
of the bounds, the type of poverty transition, and the number of replications used to
obtain the upper bound (50, 100, 500). These estimates are found to be as accurate

Abstract Between 2000 and 2013, Latin America has considerably reduced poverty (from 46.3 to 29.7 % of the population). In this paper, we use synthetic panels
to show that, despite progress, the region remains characterized by substantial
vulnerability that also affects the rising middle class. More speciﬁcally, we ﬁnd that
65 % of those with daily income between $4 and 10, and 14 % of those in the
middle class experience poverty at least once over a 10-year period. Furthermore,
chronic poverty remains widespread (representing 91 and 50 % of extreme and
moderate poverty, respectively). Differences between rural and urban areas are
substantial. Urban areas, which are now home to most moderate poor and vulnerable, are characterized by higher income mobility, particularly upward mobility.
These ﬁndings have important implications for the design of effective social safety
nets. These need to mix long-term interventions for the chronic poor, especially in
rural areas, with ﬂexible short-term support to a large group of transient poor and
vulnerable, particularly in urban areas.

1 Introduction
In recent years, Latin America has made remarkable progress in the reduction of
poverty and inequality. Between 2000 and 2013, the percentage of the population
living on less than $2.5 per capita per day decreased from 28.8 to 15.9 %, while the
share of the population living on less than $4 dropped from 46.3 to 29.7 %. Over the
same period, the region has also managed to reduce its unfortunately distinctive
inequality: the Gini coefﬁcient of the income distribution fell from 0.57 to 0.51.
These improvements were largely driven by sustained economic growth, which
led to an expansion of the middle class.1 However, despite these positive trends, the
region is still home to 92 million extreme poor and 77 million moderate poor. In
addition, most of those that exited poverty joined the vulnerable class and are still at
substantial risk of falling into poverty (Fig. 1).
The trends in the incidence and depth of poverty, however, do not fully capture
poverty dynamics, i.e., its duration and how often families enter and exit poverty.
This information is very important for the design of effective social safety nets,
particularly as far as targeting and recertiﬁcation are concerned.2 Frequent
movements in and out of poverty imply the need for ﬂexible safety net entry and
exit rules.
The analysis of poverty dynamics and income mobility in developing countries
has received relatively limited attention, largely due to the lack of adequate
longitudinal data.3 Recently, Ferreira et al. (2013) and Vakis et al. (2015) have
analyzed intra-generational mobility in Latin America, with a focus, respectively,
on the middle class and the chronic poor. Their analysis is based on the synthetic
panel methodology developed by Dang et al. (2014), which is the same we employ
in this paper. The two works construct two-period transition matrices [1995–2010 in
Ferreira et al. (2013), 2004–2012 in Vakis et al. (2015)] and deﬁne the chronic poor
as those that were poor in both years. The analysis only captures mobility from the
ﬁrst period to the last period, and not yearly mobility in between the two.

Targeting is the process of identiﬁcation of poor and vulnerable beneﬁciaries, as opposed to universal
entitlement to beneﬁts. Recertiﬁcation is the periodic veriﬁcation of beneﬁciaries’ living standards, to
assess whether they still qualify for receiving the beneﬁts.

et al. (2013), Vakis et al. (2015). What is missing in this literature is the analysis of poverty or income
dynamics with long panels made of consecutive years. Robles and Saenz (2015) have started to ﬁll this
gap; using synthetic panels (similar to those employed in this paper) and a discrete-time hazard model,
they identify the factors associated with long-term poverty and exit from poverty in a sample of Latin

Consequently, it depicts the vulnerable and the middle class as consolidated in their
position (with a low probability of experiencing poverty).
In this paper, we generate 10-year synthetic panels for a large sample of Latin
American countries, and use them to estimate yearly movements in and out of
poverty from 2003 to 2013. We provide a novel classiﬁcation of households based
on poverty duration, which distinguishes chronic poor, transient poor, future poor,
and never poor. The future poor include those that initially belonged to the
vulnerable, middle, and high-income classes, and experienced poverty at any time
over the following decade.
We ﬁnd that 65 % of the vulnerable (i.e., those with daily income between $4 and
10), and 14 % of those in the middle class (with daily income between $10 and 50)
of 2003, experienced poverty at least once during the period 2004–13. At the same
time, chronic poverty remains widespread, accounting for 91 and 50 % of extreme
and moderate poverty, respectively. Differences between rural and urban areas are
substantial. Urban areas, which are now home to most moderate poor and
vulnerable, are characterized by higher (particularly upward) income mobility.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 deﬁnes poverty and
vulnerability, and describes the data and the methodology employed for constructing synthetic panels and forecasting poverty dynamics. Section 3 presents the trends
in poverty reduction and shows that the Latin American region is highly
heterogeneous in the stage and speed of the socioeconomic transition towards the
middle class. Section 4 analyzes poverty dynamics, including transition matrices
and poverty duration, and discusses household characteristics of chronic and
transient poor. Section 5 highlights the main differences between urban and rural
poverty. Section 6 concludes summarizing key ﬁndings and policy implications.
and recertiﬁcation processes.4
Six annexes provide additional information on data, methods, sensitivity
analyses, and country results. Annex 1 lists the data sources. Annex 2 summarizes
the existing literature comparing results from genuine panel data with nonparametric, parametric, and point estimate synthetic-panel methods. Annex 3 shows
the bounds of selected estimates, providing a visual representation of the quality of
our results. Annex 4 presents sensitivity analyses of key chronic poverty results to
the adoption of alternative poverty lines. Annex 5 shows that the variation in the
share of urban population is limited between 2003 and 2013, which is necessary for
the validity of the rural/urban breakdown of the dynamic analyses based on the
pseudo panel methodology. Finally, Annex 6 presents country-speciﬁc poverty
proﬁles.

2 Data and methodology5
We look at poverty through two lenses, one that focuses on depth and the other on
duration. The former is static, and analyzes a picture of poverty through the value of
daily per-capita income (expressed in 2005 dollars adjusted to reﬂect purchasing
power parity). It divides the population in ﬁve groups: (i) the extreme poor, with
income below $2.5; (ii) the moderate poor, between $2.5 and 4; (iii) the vulnerable,
´
between $4 and 10; (iv) the middle class, between $10 and 50 [as in Lopez-Calva
´
and Ortiz-Juarez (2011)]; and (v) the high-income class, above $50.
The $2.5 line corresponds to the median of the ofﬁcial extreme poverty lines in
Latin American countries (CEDLAS and World Bank 2012), and has already been
used in regional studies (World Bank 2014). It is higher than the international
extreme poverty line of $1.25 used by Ravallion et al. (2008), which corresponds to
the mean of the ofﬁcial extreme poverty lines of the 15 poorest countries in the
world. The use of a higher line reﬂects the relatively more advanced stage of
socioeconomic development (and the higher price levels) of the Latin American
region. Similar considerations hold for the $4 poverty line. The vulnerable class is
´
´
deﬁned by Lopez-Calva and Ortiz-Juarez (2011), as having a per capita daily
income between $4 and 10, which is empirically observed to imply a probability
greater than 10 % of falling into poverty.
The second lens is dynamic and focuses on the duration of poverty. It divides the
population in four groups: (i) the chronic poor, that are poor (either extreme or
4

We refer to social safety nets as the systems of social protection for the poor and vulnerable. In the
Inter-American Development Bank Strategic Framework Document on Social Protection and Poverty,
this is deﬁned as ‘‘(i) efﬁcient redistributive programs that contribute to human capital development; and
(ii) delivery of services for social inclusion, in particular those aimed at early childhood development and
at-risk youth’’ (IDB 2014). The ﬁndings of this paper are particularly relevant for the design and
implementation of redistributive programs, such as conditional cash transfers (CCTs), whose duration and
level of beneﬁts should depend on poverty duration and depth.

Non-technical readers can skip this section with no prejudice to their ability to understand the rest
decade;6 (ii) the transient poor, that are poor in the ﬁrst year, and again in four or
less years over the following decade; (iii) the future poor, that are either vulnerable,
middle class, or high income in the ﬁrst year of analysis, but experience poverty in
at least 1 year during the following 10 years; (iv) the never poor, who are always
above the $4 poverty line.
Conditioning the deﬁnition of chronic and transient poverty on being poor in the
ﬁrst year guarantees that the sum of extreme and moderate poverty equals the sum
of chronic and transient poverty. In other words, the incidence of poverty does not
change, no matter if one looks at it through the lenses of depth or through those of
duration.
The analysis focusing on the static deﬁnition of poverty is based on observed
micro-data from 216 cross-sectional household surveys collected between 2000 and
2013 in 18 Latin American countries (see Annex 1).7 These data are from IDB’s
Harmonized Data Bank of Household Surveys from Latin America and the
Caribbean (also known as IDB’s Sociometro). Regional estimates of the incidence
of poverty are obtained by imputing missing values for years with no survey, then
calculating population-weighted averages of country estimates.
The data are representative both at the national level and at the urban–rural level,
with the exception of Argentina, Uruguay, and Venezuela. In Argentina, the
household survey is only urban. In Uruguay, rural areas have been surveyed only
since 2006; we restrict the analysis to urban areas to ensure comparability over the
period 2000–2013. In Venezuela, since 2004, the survey does not contain a variable
that allows separating rural and urban areas.
Given the unavailability of real-panel data sets, in which the same households are
surveyed across time, the analysis of poverty duration is based on the construction
of synthetic panels a la Dang et al. (2014).8 This method was originally designed to
analyze transitions in and out of poverty based on two (or more) rounds of crosssectional data. In addition, the literature, so far, has focused on proving the
reliability of the methodology (Cruces et al. 2011; Fields and Viollaz 2013; Haynes
et al. 2013). Our objective is slightly different, as we aim to investigate poverty
duration, or more speciﬁcally in how many years a family has been poor over a
decade. For this purpose, we calculate yearly point estimates of per-capita income
based on yearly cross-sectional data.9
The sample is made of families surveyed in the ﬁrst year (t = 0). For each of the
following 10 years (s = 1,10), we estimate per-capita income using time-invariant

6

The 5-year threshold, like any alternative threshold, is somehow arbitrary. However, the results
presented in this paper are generally robust to the adoption of alternative values.

7

These are the 18 countries that regularly execute household surveys and share their databases with the
IDB. We lament not being able to include Caribbean countries, for which such data is not available.

8

Other synthetic or pseudo-panel approaches are those that track cohorts of individuals or households
over repeated cross-sectional surveys (Deaton 1985), and those that recover the stochastic process from
cross sectional data and generate individual income dynamics (Bourguignon et al. 2004).

9

We follow Canavire and Robles (2013), who, using this kind of panels and non-parametric duration
residuals.10 The methodology assumes a linear structure of the income equation,
and is based on the following two assumptions: (i) households do not change, which
ensures that time-invariant variables observed in t = 0 can be used to estimate
income in t = s, and (ii) the correlation of the error terms across time (et¼0 and et=s)
is not negative. This is a reasonable assumption given that income shocks show
persistence over time, and factors leading to a negative correlation of income over
time are unlikely to apply to all households at the same time. The methodology
requires estimating the following equations:
yi;t ¼ b0t xi;t þ ei;t

for t ¼ 0; 10

ð1Þ

i.e., for the ﬁrst period and for the following 10 years, where yi,t is the logarithm of
household i’s per-capita income at time t, and xi,t is a vector of variables measuring
household i’s characteristics at time t. Our speciﬁcation of the model includes
variables typically employed in the literature (Dang et al. 2014; Cruces et al. 2011),
plus statistically signiﬁcant variables at the regional level. The vector x contains the
following variables:
(i)
(ii)

(iii)
(iv)

Household head characteristics: sex, age, age squared, years of schooling,
years of schooling squared, and agricultural work;
Region (ﬁrst-level administrative country subdivision) characteristics:
average years of schooling of the household heads, and proportion of
workers in agriculture;
Geographic controls: rural–urban residence;
Retrospective regressors at regional level in the initial year (2003):
inequality (standard deviation of log income), extreme poverty headcount
($2.5 a day), average per capita income, average household size, and
average years of schooling of the household heads.

^
^
The regressions produce 11 estimates of vectors b and e (bt and et , one for each
^
time period). They also produce 11 estimates of the error term variance (ret ). These
parameters are used to produce the synthetic-panel estimates of yearly per-capita
income.
Following Cruces et al. (2011), Fields and Viollaz (2013), and Haynes et al.
(2013), we use the ‘‘non-parametric’’ version of the method, i.e., we make no
assumptions on the structural form of the joint distribution of the errors terms. Two
extreme assumptions on the non-parametric time correlation of the error terms lead
to a lower and upper bound estimate of per-capita income mobility. At one extreme,
one can assume zero correlation between et¼0 and et=s, i.e., that the two error terms
are independent from each other. The logarithm of per capita income of household
i in t = s (^U ) is estimated as follows:
yi;t¼s

10
Dang et al. (2014) and Cruces et al. (2011) show that the method performs well irrespective of the
forecasting direction, i.e. that estimates of mobility are very similar if one predicts per-capita income in
~
^i;t¼s ^
yU ¼ bt¼s xi;t¼0 þ ei;t¼s

ð2Þ

^
~
where the apex U indicates uncorrelated error terms, and ei;t¼s is the mean of 50
random draws (with replacement) from the vector of estimated residuals in t = s. At
the other extreme, one can assume perfect correlation between et¼0 and et=s. Under
this assumption, the logarithm of per capita income of household i in t = s (^C ) is
yi;t¼s
estimated as follows:
0

^i;t¼s ^
yC ¼ bt¼s xi;t¼0 þ c^i;t¼0

ð3Þ

where the apex C indicates correlated error terms, ei;t¼0 is (the time-invariant)
^
^
household i’s empirical error term estimated in t = 0, and c ¼ ret¼0 =ret¼s . is a scale
factor.
Dang et al. (2014) and Cruces et al. (2011) show that: (i) Eq. (2) produces upperbound estimates of income mobility, due to the high variation in the error term, and
overestimates people’s movements in and out of poverty; (ii) Eq. (3) produces
lower-bound estimates of income mobility, due to the constant error term, and
underestimates poverty transitions; and (iii) the average of (2) and (3) approximates
well the observed income mobility, providing a satisfactory estimation of
movements in and out of poverty. This last point is proved empirically by
comparing synthetic-panel estimates of mobility with those observed in genuine
panel data. We, therefore, calculate point estimates of per-capita income of the
households in the synthetic-panel as follows:11Recently, Dang and Lanjouw (2013)
have developed a point estimate synthetic panel approach, which generalizes the use
of non-parametric and parametric methods to produce point estimates of poverty
transitions. This could have been used, as alternative to Eq. (4), to produce the
estimates of poverty duration presented in this paper. We preferred to rely on
Eq. (4), because the two methods have been shown to be empirically equivalent in
terms of accuracy, and because Dang and Lanjouw (2013) indicate that the pointestimate methodology is most accurate when short time periods are analyzed. The
existing literature comparing results from genuine panel data with non-parametric,
parametric, and point estimate synthetic-panel methods is summarized in Annex 2.

As a result, our analysis of income mobility is based on income observed in 2003
along with income estimated for the years between 2004 and 2013. The quality of the
predictions is essential to guarantee that results are credible. As is usual practice, we
carefully ensured the quality of the ﬁt (value of R-squared, signiﬁcance of coefﬁcients,
over-ﬁtting). In Annex 3, we show for selected countries that the upper and lower
bounds of predicted incomes produce poverty rates that are very close to the rates
11

Dang et al. (2014) suggest that standard errors for the bounds can be estimated by bootstrapping. This
involves bootstrap resampling from the original cross-sections while accounting for survey weights
(footnote 14). Similarly, we could obtain standard errors for our point estimates by complementing Dang
of chronic poverty, transient poverty, and future poverty in selected countries.
Our methodology can only be applied to 12 countries that have household survey
data for each year between 2003 and 2013 (Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Costa
Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Honduras, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, El
Salvador, and Uruguay). Regional numbers were obtained pooling micro-data from
the 12 countries and using survey weights.12

3 Static analysis: an heterogeneous and still vulnerable region
Latin America is a very heterogeneous region in terms of the stage of
socioeconomic transition, deﬁned as the process of transition out of poverty
towards the middle class. Countries such as Argentina, Chile, and Uruguay, are at an
advanced stage, being mainly made of middle and high-income class (with the
incidence of poverty around 10 %). On the other hand, countries such as Guatemala
and Honduras, are at the earliest stages: almost half of their population still lives in
extreme poverty, and the incidence of overall poverty exceeds 65 % (Table 1).
One feature, however, is common to all countries: the large size of the vulnerable
class. This represents in most cases 30–40 % of the population, suggesting that an
important share of the population remains at substantial risk of falling into poverty.
Countries with low poverty rates and large middle classes are no exception. In these
countries, the vulnerable class is the back end of the socioeconomic transition; while
in the poorest countries, the vulnerable class leads the way.
Country heterogeneity is also high in the speed of the socio-economic transition.
For example, Colombia and Ecuador reduced the incidence of poverty by more than
25 percentage points (pp), and expanded their middle and upper classes by more
than 15 pp (Table 1). In contrast, progress was sluggish in Mexico and Dominican
Republic, despite the fact that these countries started from poverty headcounts
around 40 %.
Table 2 summarizes the region’s heterogeneity by classifying the Latin American
countries based on the stage and speed of their socioeconomic transition. In the
countries in the upper-left cell, for example, Nicaragua and El Salvador, the poor
still represents the largest share of the population, and poverty reduction has been
relatively slow (less than 25 % between 2000 and 2013). These are the countries
with the highest need for reforming and/or expanding the social safety net, as
poverty is widespread and resilient. These are also the countries with less ﬁnancial
resources for its implementation, so efﬁciency should be at the top of their policy
agenda.

Brazil does not have a household survey for 2010. In order to include it in the dynamic analysis, we
considered mobility over the period 2002–2013. It is important to highlight the caveat that our dynamic
analysis is based on twelve countries with available data. Among the excluded countries is Mexico, which
accounts for an important share of the population of the region. The exclusion of Mexico is due to the fact
that the Encuesta Nacional sobre Ingresos y Gastos de los Hogares is carried out every two years, while
the Encuesta Nacional de Ocupacion y Empleo is yearly but has been nationally representative only since

4 Dynamic analysis: poverty is still largely chronic
Income mobility between 2003 and 2013 was considerable. Poverty reduction was
the net effect of many exiting poverty, while fewer were falling back. Upward
mobility was particularly high for those that started in moderate poverty.
Most of the moderate poor rose to the vulnerable class, and a few (6 %) made it
to the middle class (Table 3).13 In contrast, 73 % of those that were initially extreme
poor were still poor after a decade, although many enjoyed less severe poverty and
another quarter rose to the vulnerable class. As may be expected (as they started
from higher initial living standards), also the vulnerable enjoyed less upper
mobility. Only 28 % of them rose to the middle class, while 62 % remained in the
initial income category and 10 % fell into poverty.
Chronic poverty was widespread among both the extreme and the moderate poor.
Many of those that were initially moderate poor, despite enjoying a high likelihood
of rising to the vulnerable class in 2013, were poor in at least 5 years over the period
2004–2013. This may be explained by an ascending trajectory that only rose above
the poverty line in the last part of the period of analysis.
On average, 91 % of extreme poverty were chronic (Table 4), with very little
country heterogeneity (Fig. 2). In almost all countries with available data, about
90 % or more of the extreme poor in 2003 remained poor in at least ﬁve of the
following 10 years. The only exceptions were Argentina and Uruguay, for which
data are urban only.
More surprisingly, also half of the moderate poor in 2003 was chronically poor.14
This has important implications for the design and implementation of the social
safety nets. In particular, it implies that long-term interventions are not only needed
for the extreme poor, but also for an important share of those in moderate poverty.

Table 3 presents the two-point transition matrix, similar to Table 4.1 of Ferreira et al. (2013) and
Table 1 of Vakis et al. (2015), using a larger number of income groups and extending the time period to
2013.

Fig. 2 Chronic poverty in Latin American countries (2003–2013)

An important share of the vulnerable and, more surprisingly, of the middle class
experienced poverty over the period 2004–13. More precisely, 65 % of the
vulnerable group and 14 % of the middle class of 2003 were poor at least once over
the following decade. We call these families ‘‘future poor’’, a group whose share
ranged from 10 % of the population in Argentina to 38 % in Costa Rica (Fig. 3).
Finally, the share of the population that was never poor ranged from 8 % in
Honduras to 57 % in Uruguay (Fig. 3).
The identiﬁcation of the chronic and transient poor in the samples of 2003 allows
investigating the household characteristics that are associated with different poverty
durations. In other words, it allows studying who are the chronic poor, how they
differ from the transient poor and, for comparison, from the non-poor. We address
these questions by looking at Paraguay and Honduras, two countries at different
stages of the socio-economic transition.
Household characteristics of the chronic poor broadly mimic those that, in the
literature, are commonly associated with extreme poverty. They include larger
household size, more children, lower levels of education, more engagement in selfemployment, less wage employment, and residence in rural areas. Table 5 reports
average household characteristics by dynamic poverty status in Paraguay and
Honduras. Despite a few differences between the two countries, most patterns are
common and the similarities are striking. In both countries, for example, chronically
poor households had no member with complete tertiary education. In Honduras,
they did not even have any member with complete secondary education; while in
Paraguay, only one in six chronically poor households had one member with this
level of schooling. Their likelihood to live in rural areas was ten times higher than
among the non-poor. Self-employment decreased and wage employment grew as
one moved from chronic poverty to non-poverty. The low level of human capital
and the remote location suggest that, at least among the chronic poor, the graduation

5 Differences between urban and rural areas
The region has undergone a process of urbanization, which has been slowing down
in recent years. The urban share of the population has been growing from 49 % in
1960 to 80 % in 2013, and is expected to reach 83 % in 2025 (ECLAC 2013). In our
sample of countries, this ﬁgure has increased from 72 % in 2000 to 74 % in 2013
(Table 6, panel B). In this context, it is extremely important to understand the
different urban–rural trends in poverty reduction, as when it comes to poverty, cities
and countryside remain two worlds apart.15
Extreme and overall poverty have decreased substantially in both urban and rural
areas. Yet, in the latter, one-third of the population still lives in extreme poverty,
and the incidence of total poverty exceeds 50 % (Table 6, panel A).
The growth of a middle class is an eminently urban phenomenon. In rural areas,
poverty reduction has been accompanied by an expansion of the vulnerable class,
and only 13 % of the population had per-capita income above $10 in 2013. In
contrast, the size of the vulnerable class remained fairly constant in urban areas.
This is where the middle class expanded more rapidly (by over 10 pp).
As a result, the rural nature of poverty has intensiﬁed, with a substantial increase of
the share of poor living in rural areas. While in 2000 the rural areas were home to 54 %
of the extreme poor and 30 % of the moderate poor, these ﬁgures increased to 58 and
15
It is relevant to acknowledge that the term urban refers to very different sizes of human settlements
(Satterthwaite 2010), that may range from as few as 2500 to as many as several million inhabitants.
only the high-income class became more urban during the period of analysis.
In 2013, the majority of the extreme poor lived in urban areas only in four
countries (Brazil, Chile, Colombia and Dominican Republic). In contrast, with few
exceptions, moderate poverty was fairly equally distributed between urban and rural
areas (Fig. 4). This suggests that long-term social safety net programs are best
suited for rural areas, while short-term interventions are equally needed in urban and
rural areas.
In the near future, in urban areas, poverty is expected to leave way to a rising
middle class (Fig. 5). This forecast is obtained by combining economic growth and
demographic projections with the estimated growth elasticity of poverty. While the
size of the vulnerable class will remain fairly stable (at around 40 % of the urban
population), by 2025 the incidence of urban poverty is expected to fall to 13 %. The
middle class will rise to represent 42 % of the urban population.
In contrast, the growth of the middle class will be slow in rural areas. Poverty
will be mostly replaced by vulnerability. The vulnerable class is expected to become
the single largest group in 2021, and grow to 47 % of the rural population in 2025.
Failing to account for substantial rural to urban migration may bias the results of
the poverty dynamic analysis based on the pseudo-panel methodology (which
assumes that household characteristics, including residence in rural or urban areas,
are constant over time). For example, one may overestimate the number of poverty
episodes in rural areas, if some rural families have migrated to urban areas and have
managed, through migration, to transition to the vulnerable class. The direction of
the bias will depend on who migrates (usually not the poorest) and how migration
affects their income.
In Annex 5, we analyze the variation in the proportion of urban population over the
period 2003–2013. We show that its magnitude is small, and does not threaten the
validity of our ﬁndings. This result is consistent with the slowdown in the process of
urbanization documented in CELADE—Population Division of ECLAC (2015).
The urban and rural poverty dynamics analyses conﬁrm that most of the mobility
out of poverty took place in urban areas. In the cities, 35 % of the extreme poor and

Fig. 5 Poverty, vulnerability, and middle class in Latin America (2000–2025), region aggregate

73 % of the moderate poor in 2003 had exited poverty after 10 years, against only
15 and 53 % in rural areas (Table 7). A similar pattern can be observed for upward
mobility from the vulnerable class. Symmetrically, the risk of falling from the
middle class to the vulnerable class or into poverty was more than double in rural
than in urban areas (44 versus 21 %). This may also be due to the differential urban–
rural impacts of the world recession in the second part of the period of analysis.
Rural areas are characterized by high incidence of chronic poverty and future
poverty. 99 % of the extreme poor and 78 % of those that were moderate poor in
2003 experienced chronic poverty between 2004 and 2013. Furthermore, 86 % of
the vulnerable and 37 % of the middle class were poor at least once during the
period of analysis. The picture is relatively rosier in urban areas, where ‘‘only’’
86 % of extreme poverty and 42 % of moderate poverty were chronic, and where
‘‘only’’ 62 % of the vulnerable experienced at least one episode of poverty (Fig. 6).
Cross-country analysis shows that Ecuador and Panama present the widest gap
between rural and urban areas, a result that is driven by the highly transient nature of
urban moderate poverty. Variability is limited in the percentage of extreme poor that
are chronic poor, both in rural and urban areas. More differences emerge when
looking at the percentage of moderate poor that experience chronic poverty. This is,
particularly, the case in urban areas. While in El Salvador 71 % of urban moderate
poor experience chronic poverty over the following decade, the same happens to
only one every ﬁve urban moderate poor in Ecuador and Panama. This indicates that
in these countries, urban moderate poverty is particularly transient (Fig. 7).

6 Conclusions and implication for the design and implementation
of social safety nets
In the absence of information on poverty dynamics, development practitioners
frequently assume that extreme poverty is chronic and rural, while moderate poverty
is transient and urban. Similarly, they tend to expect that the vulnerable are at risk of
falling into poverty, while the middle class has reached a safe place and no longer

Fig. 7 Urban and rural chronic poverty in Latin American countries (2003–2013)

In this paper, we construct synthetic panels and analyze poverty dynamics for a
large sample of Latin American countries, with the aim to provide policy makers
and development practitioners (engaged in project design) with estimates of the
duration of poverty. While the availability of real long panel data would allow
reﬁning and deepening the analysis, we believe that our results constitute a useful
proxy and hope they will stimulate further data collection and research. Our analysis
contributes to debunking a few common assumptions.
First, we show that chronic poverty is widespread also among the moderate poor.
This type of poverty, characterized by long duration, accounts for 91 % of extreme
poverty and, surprisingly, 50 % of moderate poverty. As expected, chronic poverty
is more frequent in rural areas, where 99 % of the extreme poor and as many as
78 % of the moderate poor are chronic poor.
Second, we show that also the middle class is still exposed to a substantial risk of
falling back into poverty. More speciﬁcally, we ﬁnd that 14 % of those that
belonged to the middle class in 2003 experienced at least one poverty episode
during the following decade.
Our results differ from those of Ferreira et al. (2013) and Vakis et al. (2015),
although they are based on the application of a similar synthetic panel methodology.
These authors analyze mobility between two periods only, and ﬁnd that the
vulnerable and the middle class are more consolidated in their status. For example,
Ferreira et al. (2013, Table 4.1) estimate that only 2.7 % of the vulnerable and
0.5 % of the middle class fall back into poverty.
Our ﬁndings have important implications for the design and implementation of
social safety nets. First, they suggest that interventions that target the rural poor and
the urban extreme poor need to adopt a long-term perspective. The frequent
recertiﬁcation of the beneﬁciaries might not be needed and, probably, represents a
loss of administrative and ﬁnancial resources.
Second, our ﬁndings suggest that interventions that target the urban moderate poor
satisfactorily. The Brazilian model based on declared income may represent a better
alternative, if it can be coupled with frequent recertiﬁcation and electronic audits of
eligibility based on crossing information from the roster of beneﬁciaries with other
sources of administrative data (e.g., social security contributions, ownership of assets).
Third, we show that the chronic poor have extremely low levels of human capital
and live in rural areas with limited opportunity of wage employment. These are key
factors for escaping poverty. Consequently, our ﬁndings suggest that, at least for this
group, graduation strategies aimed at increasing income-generation capacity have
low probabilities of success.16
Finally, the ﬁnding that both the vulnerable and the middle class are likely to
experience poverty in the future implies that the social safety nets remain relevant
for many that are currently out of poverty.17
A caveat is worth mentioning. Our dynamic analysis is based on 12 countries for
which data are available. Further work is needed to incorporate results for more
countries and increase the representativeness of our ﬁndings.

Annex 1: Data sources
IDB’s Harmonized Data Bank of Household Surveys from Latin America and the
Caribbean (also known as IDB’s Sociometro) contains harmonized household data
sets for Latin American and Caribbean countries starting from the late 1980s.
Variable names, deﬁnitions, and contents are kept constant across countries and
time. Table 8 shows the number of data sets used for the preparation of this paper.
Although it is well known that per-capita consumption is a better proxy for wellbeing, we use per-capita income, because few countries in the region routinely
conduct surveys with a consumption module, while all of them include questions on
income. We calculate per-capita income by dividing total household income by the
number of household members, without using any adult equivalence scale.
Income components are reported after-tax whenever possible. Extraordinary
income sources are not considered. Similarly, we do not include the implicit rent
from owned or occupied housing, because not all countries capture the information

we do not make any imputation for missing, null or outlying values in addition to
those already contained in the data sets provided by the national statistical ofﬁces.
Finally, we do not make adjustments for differences in urban–rural prices.

Annex 2: Synthetic-panel methodology
Table 9 summarizes the existing literature comparing results from genuine panel
data with non-parametric, parametric, and point estimate synthetic-panel methods.
All results reported are based on the use of household time-invariant characteristics,
sub-national controls, and region ﬁxed effects, consistently with the deﬁnition of our
own model. They show that the estimates based on the average of the bounds
(Eq. (4)) approximate well the estimates based on genuine panel data, irrespective
of the length of the period analyzed (2 years in Peru, versus 10 in Chile), the width
of the bounds, the type of poverty transition, and the number of replications used to
obtain the upper bound (50, 100, 500). These estimates are found to be as accurate
18
Given our deﬁnition of the income variables, our poverty estimates may differ from the ofﬁcial ones
