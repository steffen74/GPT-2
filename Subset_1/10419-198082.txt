Abstract: Although it is a relative old concept, having ruts in the writings of the late „60s,
globalization has become in current times a cliché, being used in many parts of the world and in many
languages but not having a specific definition. Financial globalization is considered to be the core element
of the process of globalization and consists in a complex integration of financial markets through exchange
and financial flows.
In this context, the economic agents are considered to be important players, given the fact that for
their investments they appeal to financial recourses wherever they may be. However there investment
behavior is greatly influenced by the state, through the fiscal policy, especially through a very important
instrument at its disposal, the profit tax rate.
The aim of this paper is to emphasize the evolution of the relationship between the profit tax and
investments, in the case of Romania from 1990 until 2008, trying to show particular developments of each of
this two variables studied and the relations between them, the amplitude of influence exercised by them. The
paper also focuses upon a better understanding of how the variables analyzed influence the real economy in
this globalized environment.

1. Introduction

The performance of the economic activity in any country is directly dependent on the
development capacity, on the profitability and return on economic activities of the enterprises, the
basic economic links.

decisions and strategies adopted by the management with the purpose of enhancing the profitability
and long term return rate.
However, the enterprises don’t act in a chaotic manner because they have to play by some
defined rules where the “referee” is the state. The state is the one that can sometimes help, but it
also can constrain the sphere of an economic entity using various instruments at its disposal.
Thereby, the public authority has at its disposal a range of different instruments like the
intervention of the political regime (the form of government), monetary policy, fiscal policy etc. As
the practice has shown the monetary and fiscal policy are two very important means through which
the state can influence the economy. In particular, the fiscal policy through a very specific tool (the
Profit Tax) can exert an important influence upon the investment process of an economic agent.
These two elements in particular: the profit tax and investments – the first one being at the
disposal of the state and the second one at the hand of the economic agents – present a particular
and special relationship of mutual determination in the way that the size and the importance of one
of them has repercussions on the other one, and vice versa.

2. Financial literature regarding the concept of investment
A special place in the decisions of a company is occupied by the investments decision, which
is considered the most important financial decision. The importance of those decisions is evidenced
by the direct influence they have on the degree of liquidity of the company, because investment
decisions influence the way how available cash resources are allocated efficiently by a company to
replace old equipment, technical modernization and improvement etc. to perform the better manner
of functioning of the company to ensure the highest optimum parameters. The decision to invest, is
an important decision, with which company is facing throughout the period of its existence, usually
this kind of decision is irreversible (Gudji, 2001, p.273).
Seen through the prism of its complexity, the notion of investment has been defined in the
literature in several ways, namely:


Financial – investment is seen as an immediate payment in view of future earnings or

capital immobilization, order to achieve a capital gain over several periods (Brezeanu, 2009, p.36);


Accountant – represents the amounts allocated for investment of fixed assets such as

land, buildings, industrial machinery, patents, licenses, equity and others, including all three
categories of property: intangible, tangible and financial;


Legal – the investments are reprezented of any acquisitions or investments cover the

elements that constitute the subject of a property as a heritage elements: rural and urban households,
productive equipment, vehicles, securities, money (Onofrei, 2003, p. 194);


Monetary – investments are regarded as "all expenses incurred to obtain monetary

income in the future" (Teodorescu and Vasile, 2005, p.208). Under this approach, all expenditure
incurred within a business are included in investment, without taking account of their object, in this
case the concept of investment is overlap over the notion of cost.


Psychological – focuses on the ability of an individual or company to give up at

money or goods in exchange for future assets, which will reward time period in which the person
has gave up his resources , expected inflation and the risk (uncertainty of achieving future
earnings).
By linking all meanings attributed to the concept of investment, we can define its scope, as all
action of long-term immobilization of all current resources: money, material and human resources
in order to obtain in the future higher incomes than those which could be obtained today.
3. Investment in Romania after the ‘90
In post-revolutionary Romania, where private property rights revert to its natural, people have
been concerned with the development of activities generating tangible or intangible benefits. This
has led to strong growth in the number of private economic entities, which have always been
interested in increasing the profitability of their activities, goal they wanted to achieve by investing.
This trend of commercial activities development, which was undertaken in Romania, can be
seen from the value and volume increase of investments from 1990 to 2008, how we can see from
the following table:

What is noteworthy is that in the early '90s, the biggest share of the investment was owned by
construction, while the share of investments in various technological equipment, although not a
very big difference, have a lower value. This would later change, because since 1993 the share of
investment in construction and the share of investment in equipment has been reversed, as in
Romania of that time showed a continuous increase in the share of investment in equipment, namely
the productive capital, while the investment in construction was dropping, but there are two
exceptions represented by the years 1995 and 2005, when the construction component had a high
value than technological equipment.

Another important aspect that emerges from analysis of data from Table 1 is related to the
dynamic performance of investments made in Romania. This element is highlighted in the
following graphic:

It can be seen, that investments have developed very quickly, especially in the period 1990 1994, a stage in which the investments made in Romania have increased from one year to another in
the following way: the value of investments in 1991 were 80% higher than in 1990, while the next
three years were characterized by an approximate tripling of the value of investments from one year
to another. However, this growth seems to be considered taking into account the dramatic economic
situation it was in Romania in the early 90s, a period characterized by an acute inflation which
reached an average of over 256 percent in the period 1990 to 1994, according to the Report Inflation

amount of investment in Romania in the early years of the last decade, not due to an increase in real
value but rather an artificial increase due to rampant inflation that characterized Romania from that
time.
Concerning the last time, from 2000 until 2008, the value of investments increased from one
year to another with an average of about 30%. This growth was sustained by the steady economic
environment, characterized by an inflation rate reduced by an amount which has not exceeded 20
percent since early 2002.
Another element that should not be overlooked in the analysis of investment development in
Romania is represented by the sources from which those investments were made, with emphasis on
the evolution of foreign capital sources.

As can be seen in the previous graphic, investments that have foreign capital as a source of
funding, have increased since 2005, a trend which can be partially explained by the profit tax
system, because from January 1, 2005 the current flat profit tax was reduced at 16% by the
Government Emergency Ordinance no. 138/2004, amending the Tax Code, a development that was
also anticipated in the economic literature (Martin, 2006, p.144).

4. Changes of the profit tax rate and their implications

The revolution from 1989 brought major changes at all levels of political, economical and
social from Romania. This shift from a socialist state in which the central element was represented

initiate profitable business, required significant changes in the Romanian legislation concerning the
tax system.
The fact that, until 1990 was only one owner – the state, determined "subjective and
automatically transfer of the benefits to the state budget” (Corduneanu, 1998, p.549), but once with
the transition to a democratic society by redefining property rights and the establishment of
economic agents who had private or mixed capital (public and private), the state had to create a
legislative framework to govern the enterprises obligations on their profit.
No. 12/1991 Profit Tax Law, is one that opens the long and hard road of rules relating to
taxable profit, these rules were constantly evolving in light of the real businesses life. All laws,
ordinances and resolutions that have followed, tried to explain and to fill gaps in previous
legislation or were made in order to facilitate the private sector in economic development and meet
the requirements for Romania's accession to the European Union.
Initially, in 1991, Law no. 12 established progressive tax rates which ranged between 0% and
77%, who was applied only to fiscal year 1991, because at the end of the year, the Government
Decision no. 804 imposed the use of progressive tax rates from 1st January 1992. But neither the
adoption of this quota system has failed to achieve a legislative stability, because in 1994 a further
amendment was decided by the Government Ordinance no. 70, which established transition to the
flat tax system, at that time was of 38%.
Although, until present, the tax legislation remained constant, but about the tax system and
profit tax rate we can’t say the same thing. The flat tax level has varied in the sense of diminishing,
leading now to a share 16%, effective from 1 January 2005.
Profit tax is one of the major revenue of the state budget, which has a relatively high share in
total budgetary revenues.
By analyzing data obtained from the site of the National Institute of Statistics, we can observe
the variation of participation the profit tax at forming the fiscal revenues from stat budget, so
between 1991-1997 the participation in the state budget is an average rate of 21.5%, ranging from a
minimum rate of 19.2%, in 1996, to a maximum rate of 24.3% recorded in 1997. In 1998 is
recorded a fall in share of revenues from profit tax owned in the state budget revenues by 8
percentage points, which is shown in the graphic below.

Source: processed data accesed on 15.10.2010 at http://www.insse.ro/cms/files/pdf/ro/cap21.pdf

Since 1998, the share of revenues from profit tax in budget state revenues is relatively low,
maintaining a downward trend between 1999 to 2001, when the share of profit tax reaches the
minimum value recorded so far in post-revolutionary Romania namely 14.8% of total revenues.
Thereafter, the rate of participation in forming the profit tax revenues has an upward trend, reaching
20% in 2004, and in the following year, 2005, to a further decrease, reaching 17.7 %.
Share declining of revenues from profit tax in budget state revenues in 2005, can be partially
explained by approving the flat income tax of 16%, event which caused on short-term this decline,
but had a long-term effect positive, whereas stimulated reinvestment of profits obtained by
economic entities, increasing the productive activities, which in subsequent years was reflected in
an increase in revenues generated by the economic agents and finally the taxable profit, resulting in
an upward trend of revenues from profit tax in budget state revenues.

5. Statistical analysis of the correlation between investments and profit tax in Romania

The two variables, investments and profit tax, whose evolution has been previously analyzed,
are not independent, because each exercise some influence over the other one.


The state is one who, in different stages of economic development, acting through legislative
acts issued in fiscal perspective it would follow, on this case the main instrument of action is
represented by the profit tax rate, which directly affects the volume size of profit tax and the
remaining amount to the company which can be used for different purposes, most important being
represented by the investment.
The profit tax size influences the size of investment, investment which in turn leads to the
creation of new value, which again is divided in several destinations, the two most important being
represented by investments and profit tax. As a result, it is clear the multiplier effect of investments,
which is closely related to the correlation with profit tax.
In trying to determine the correlation between investment and profit tax in Romania, I used as
a sample, the value of investments and profit tax (million current prices) between 1995 and 2008, a
period which includes a number of 14 years. In selecting this sample we left from premise of the
existence in time of invariant features for the two variables, so we have chosen 1995 as base year
because starting 1st January 1995 was introduced in Romania the rate proportional tax system, a
system that remained until now, although the tax rate has varied over time and reduced the value of
38% to 16% (from 1 January 2005).

As it can be seen in the previous graphic, between profit tax and investment made in Romania
during 1995 - 2008, there is a relationship of proportionality between changes in profit tax and
changes in investment.
Based on the stated sample, the relationship between variables can be estimated by simple
linear regression model equation of the form Y = a + bX, where Y will be variable profit tax, which
I will note Pt, X will be variable Investment, noted by I, a and b are the values of model parameters
of the regression estimators.
The two model parameters, a and b, are determined based on the following relationships,
given the statistical literature (Jaba, 2002, pp.381-382), namely:

Using the program EViews program we calculated the estimated equation, which is
synthesized in the following table:

Equation (3) is plotted in Graphic 5 by the blue line, indicating that the evolution of the
relationship between income and investments in Romania during 1995-2008 does not fluctuate very
much from this landmark.
Along with defining the regression line, which showing the link between profit tax and
investments, it should be measured and the intensity of this relationship, highlighting the degree of
concentration or dispersion of the values on which profit tax has had in reality around the regression
line, which consists of theoretical values.
Intensity relationship can be measured using the correlation coefficient (Jaba, 2002, pp.390391), which may take a value between -1 and +1, if the correlation coefficient has a value closer to 1 or +1, the relationship between those two variables is closer, while its value is more close to 0,
this indicates the absence of a link between the two variables.

According to calculations made in EViews we obtained correlation coefficient value of

linked very closely.

Besides the foregoing, we can ask a question, namely: "In what proportion are influenced
profit tax by investments?", To this questions, we can respond by estimating the ratio determination,
which expresses the factor X influence the changes in variable Y and is calculated in case of a
linear regression, as is the case at hand, the following formula:

Following the calculations for the regression model of investments and profit tax, we obtained
a value  2 = 0.98238, which shows that 98.238% of profit tax variation can be explained by of
investments value made in Romania during 1995-2008.

6. Conclusions

Investments and profit tax are two macroeconomic variables that influence in a strongly way a
country's economic life, how happened in Romania in the last 15 years. But these two variables do

by the other one, thing which was highlighted in this paper.
Following what we said above, we can see that after the transition to a market economy, the
occurrence of private economic entities, there was a continued increase in investment in Romania,
since 1990 until now.
An item that is noted in the study of the investments evolution in Romania is the accelerated
development of foreign capital investments since 2005, when we can see that the value of foreign
investments was 4 times higher in two years. This development can partly be explained in
conjunction with the tax system, since the entry into force on 1 January 2005 a flat profit tax
reduced at 16%. This has determinate increasing the value of foreign investments and the fact that
foreign investors were attracted by the reduced rate of profit tax, which allowed them to obtain a
high profit. At the same time it should be noted that foreign investments could be greater if the
public authority would issued the laws that would ensure greater stability of the tax system.
The amount of profit tax collected at the state budget took an upward trend, each year
recorded a higher value than that obtained in the previous year, although the proportion with
increased amount of profit tax varied widely in last 15 years . Noteworthy is the maximum amount
of growth, namely 24.3% in 1997 compared to 1996, the minimum value recorded in 2001, namely
an increase in profit tax of only 14.8% compared with 2000.
The statistical analysis carried out previously shows us that the two variables analyzed are
interconditioned and the values recorded in Romania from 1995 to 2008, forming a simple linear
regression of the form Pt= 507,9921 + 0,103·I
Based on statistical calculations performed to determine the regression model of investment
and profit tax, we obtained that the two variables are directly linked very closely, indicating that a
change in a certain sense of the investments size will determine changes of profit tax in the same
direction.
The close relationship between profit tax and investments, it's shown by determination's ratio
calculation, whereby 98,238% of profit tax changes can be explained due to the influence of size of
investments.

decisions and strategies adopted by the management with the purpose of enhancing the profitability
and long term return rate.
However, the enterprises don’t act in a chaotic manner because they have to play by some
defined rules where the “referee” is the state. The state is the one that can sometimes help, but it
also can constrain the sphere of an economic entity using various instruments at its disposal.
Thereby, the public authority has at its disposal a range of different instruments like the
intervention of the political regime (the form of government), monetary policy, fiscal policy etc. As
the practice has shown the monetary and fiscal policy are two very important means through which
the state can influence the economy. In particular, the fiscal policy through a very specific tool (the
Profit Tax) can exert an important influence upon the investment process of an economic agent.
These two elements in particular: the profit tax and investments – the first one being at the
disposal of the state and the second one at the hand of the economic agents – present a particular
and special relationship of mutual determination in the way that the size and the importance of one
of them has repercussions on the other one, and vice versa.

2. Financial literature regarding the concept of investment
A special place in the decisions of a company is occupied by the investments decision, which
is considered the most important financial decision. The importance of those decisions is evidenced
by the direct influence they have on the degree of liquidity of the company, because investment
decisions influence the way how available cash resources are allocated efficiently by a company to
replace old equipment, technical modernization and improvement etc. to perform the better manner
of functioning of the company to ensure the highest optimum parameters. The decision to invest, is
an important decision, with which company is facing throughout the period of its existence, usually
this kind of decision is irreversible (Gudji, 2001, p.273).
Seen through the prism of its complexity, the notion of investment has been defined in the
literature in several ways, namely:


Financial – investment is seen as an immediate payment in view of future earnings or

capital immobilization, order to achieve a capital gain over several periods (Brezeanu, 2009, p.36);


Accountant – represents the amounts allocated for investment of fixed assets such as

land, buildings, industrial machinery, patents, licenses, equity and others, including all three
categories of property: intangible, tangible and financial;


Legal – the investments are reprezented of any acquisitions or investments cover the

elements that constitute the subject of a property as a heritage elements: rural and urban households,
productive equipment, vehicles, securities, money (Onofrei, 2003, p. 194);


Monetary – investments are regarded as "all expenses incurred to obtain monetary

income in the future" (Teodorescu and Vasile, 2005, p.208). Under this approach, all expenditure
incurred within a business are included in investment, without taking account of their object, in this
case the concept of investment is overlap over the notion of cost.


Psychological – focuses on the ability of an individual or company to give up at

money or goods in exchange for future assets, which will reward time period in which the person
has gave up his resources , expected inflation and the risk (uncertainty of achieving future
earnings).
By linking all meanings attributed to the concept of investment, we can define its scope, as all
action of long-term immobilization of all current resources: money, material and human resources
in order to obtain in the future higher incomes than those which could be obtained today.
3. Investment in Romania after the ‘90
In post-revolutionary Romania, where private property rights revert to its natural, people have
been concerned with the development of activities generating tangible or intangible benefits. This
has led to strong growth in the number of private economic entities, which have always been
interested in increasing the profitability of their activities, goal they wanted to achieve by investing.
This trend of commercial activities development, which was undertaken in Romania, can be
seen from the value and volume increase of investments from 1990 to 2008, how we can see from
the following table:

What is noteworthy is that in the early '90s, the biggest share of the investment was owned by
construction, while the share of investments in various technological equipment, although not a
very big difference, have a lower value. This would later change, because since 1993 the share of
investment in construction and the share of investment in equipment has been reversed, as in
Romania of that time showed a continuous increase in the share of investment in equipment, namely
the productive capital, while the investment in construction was dropping, but there are two
exceptions represented by the years 1995 and 2005, when the construction component had a high
value than technological equipment.

Another important aspect that emerges from analysis of data from Table 1 is related to the
dynamic performance of investments made in Romania. This element is highlighted in the
following graphic:

It can be seen, that investments have developed very quickly, especially in the period 1990 1994, a stage in which the investments made in Romania have increased from one year to another in
the following way: the value of investments in 1991 were 80% higher than in 1990, while the next
three years were characterized by an approximate tripling of the value of investments from one year
to another. However, this growth seems to be considered taking into account the dramatic economic
situation it was in Romania in the early 90s, a period characterized by an acute inflation which
reached an average of over 256 percent in the period 1990 to 1994, according to the Report Inflation

amount of investment in Romania in the early years of the last decade, not due to an increase in real
value but rather an artificial increase due to rampant inflation that characterized Romania from that
time.
Concerning the last time, from 2000 until 2008, the value of investments increased from one
year to another with an average of about 30%. This growth was sustained by the steady economic
environment, characterized by an inflation rate reduced by an amount which has not exceeded 20
percent since early 2002.
Another element that should not be overlooked in the analysis of investment development in
Romania is represented by the sources from which those investments were made, with emphasis on
the evolution of foreign capital sources.

As can be seen in the previous graphic, investments that have foreign capital as a source of
funding, have increased since 2005, a trend which can be partially explained by the profit tax
system, because from January 1, 2005 the current flat profit tax was reduced at 16% by the
Government Emergency Ordinance no. 138/2004, amending the Tax Code, a development that was
also anticipated in the economic literature (Martin, 2006, p.144).

4. Changes of the profit tax rate and their implications

The revolution from 1989 brought major changes at all levels of political, economical and
social from Romania. This shift from a socialist state in which the central element was represented

initiate profitable business, required significant changes in the Romanian legislation concerning the
tax system.
The fact that, until 1990 was only one owner – the state, determined "subjective and
automatically transfer of the benefits to the state budget” (Corduneanu, 1998, p.549), but once with
the transition to a democratic society by redefining property rights and the establishment of
economic agents who had private or mixed capital (public and private), the state had to create a
legislative framework to govern the enterprises obligations on their profit.
No. 12/1991 Profit Tax Law, is one that opens the long and hard road of rules relating to
taxable profit, these rules were constantly evolving in light of the real businesses life. All laws,
ordinances and resolutions that have followed, tried to explain and to fill gaps in previous
legislation or were made in order to facilitate the private sector in economic development and meet
the requirements for Romania's accession to the European Union.
Initially, in 1991, Law no. 12 established progressive tax rates which ranged between 0% and
77%, who was applied only to fiscal year 1991, because at the end of the year, the Government
Decision no. 804 imposed the use of progressive tax rates from 1st January 1992. But neither the
adoption of this quota system has failed to achieve a legislative stability, because in 1994 a further
amendment was decided by the Government Ordinance no. 70, which established transition to the
flat tax system, at that time was of 38%.
Although, until present, the tax legislation remained constant, but about the tax system and
profit tax rate we can’t say the same thing. The flat tax level has varied in the sense of diminishing,
leading now to a share 16%, effective from 1 January 2005.
Profit tax is one of the major revenue of the state budget, which has a relatively high share in
total budgetary revenues.
By analyzing data obtained from the site of the National Institute of Statistics, we can observe
the variation of participation the profit tax at forming the fiscal revenues from stat budget, so
between 1991-1997 the participation in the state budget is an average rate of 21.5%, ranging from a
minimum rate of 19.2%, in 1996, to a maximum rate of 24.3% recorded in 1997. In 1998 is
recorded a fall in share of revenues from profit tax owned in the state budget revenues by 8
percentage points, which is shown in the graphic below.

Source: processed data accesed on 15.10.2010 at http://www.insse.ro/cms/files/pdf/ro/cap21.pdf

Since 1998, the share of revenues from profit tax in budget state revenues is relatively low,
maintaining a downward trend between 1999 to 2001, when the share of profit tax reaches the
minimum value recorded so far in post-revolutionary Romania namely 14.8% of total revenues.
Thereafter, the rate of participation in forming the profit tax revenues has an upward trend, reaching
20% in 2004, and in the following year, 2005, to a further decrease, reaching 17.7 %.
Share declining of revenues from profit tax in budget state revenues in 2005, can be partially
explained by approving the flat income tax of 16%, event which caused on short-term this decline,
but had a long-term effect positive, whereas stimulated reinvestment of profits obtained by
economic entities, increasing the productive activities, which in subsequent years was reflected in
an increase in revenues generated by the economic agents and finally the taxable profit, resulting in
an upward trend of revenues from profit tax in budget state revenues.

5. Statistical analysis of the correlation between investments and profit tax in Romania

The two variables, investments and profit tax, whose evolution has been previously analyzed,
are not independent, because each exercise some influence over the other one.


The state is one who, in different stages of economic development, acting through legislative
acts issued in fiscal perspective it would follow, on this case the main instrument of action is
represented by the profit tax rate, which directly affects the volume size of profit tax and the
remaining amount to the company which can be used for different purposes, most important being
represented by the investment.
The profit tax size influences the size of investment, investment which in turn leads to the
creation of new value, which again is divided in several destinations, the two most important being
represented by investments and profit tax. As a result, it is clear the multiplier effect of investments,
which is closely related to the correlation with profit tax.
In trying to determine the correlation between investment and profit tax in Romania, I used as
a sample, the value of investments and profit tax (million current prices) between 1995 and 2008, a
period which includes a number of 14 years. In selecting this sample we left from premise of the
existence in time of invariant features for the two variables, so we have chosen 1995 as base year
because starting 1st January 1995 was introduced in Romania the rate proportional tax system, a
system that remained until now, although the tax rate has varied over time and reduced the value of
38% to 16% (from 1 January 2005).

As it can be seen in the previous graphic, between profit tax and investment made in Romania
during 1995 - 2008, there is a relationship of proportionality between changes in profit tax and
changes in investment.
Based on the stated sample, the relationship between variables can be estimated by simple
linear regression model equation of the form Y = a + bX, where Y will be variable profit tax, which
I will note Pt, X will be variable Investment, noted by I, a and b are the values of model parameters
of the regression estimators.
The two model parameters, a and b, are determined based on the following relationships,
given the statistical literature (Jaba, 2002, pp.381-382), namely:

Using the program EViews program we calculated the estimated equation, which is

Equation (3) is plotted in Graphic 5 by the blue line, indicating that the evolution of the
relationship between income and investments in Romania during 1995-2008 does not fluctuate very
much from this landmark.
Along with defining the regression line, which showing the link between profit tax and
investments, it should be measured and the intensity of this relationship, highlighting the degree of
concentration or dispersion of the values on which profit tax has had in reality around the regression
line, which consists of theoretical values.
Intensity relationship can be measured using the correlation coefficient (Jaba, 2002, pp.390391), which may take a value between -1 and +1, if the correlation coefficient has a value closer to 1 or +1, the relationship between those two variables is closer, while its value is more close to 0,
this indicates the absence of a link between the two variables.

According to calculations made in EViews we obtained correlation coefficient value of

Besides the foregoing, we can ask a question, namely: "In what proportion are influenced
profit tax by investments?", To this questions, we can respond by estimating the ratio determination,
which expresses the factor X influence the changes in variable Y and is calculated in case of a

Following the calculations for the regression model of investments and profit tax, we obtained
a value  2 = 0.98238, which shows that 98.238% of profit tax variation can be explained by of
investments value made in Romania during 1995-2008.

6. Conclusions

Investments and profit tax are two macroeconomic variables that influence in a strongly way a
country's economic life, how happened in Romania in the last 15 years. But these two variables do

by the other one, thing which was highlighted in this paper.
Following what we said above, we can see that after the transition to a market economy, the
occurrence of private economic entities, there was a continued increase in investment in Romania,
since 1990 until now.
An item that is noted in the study of the investments evolution in Romania is the accelerated
development of foreign capital investments since 2005, when we can see that the value of foreign
investments was 4 times higher in two years. This development can partly be explained in
conjunction with the tax system, since the entry into force on 1 January 2005 a flat profit tax
reduced at 16%. This has determinate increasing the value of foreign investments and the fact that
foreign investors were attracted by the reduced rate of profit tax, which allowed them to obtain a
high profit. At the same time it should be noted that foreign investments could be greater if the
public authority would issued the laws that would ensure greater stability of the tax system.
The amount of profit tax collected at the state budget took an upward trend, each year
recorded a higher value than that obtained in the previous year, although the proportion with
increased amount of profit tax varied widely in last 15 years . Noteworthy is the maximum amount
of growth, namely 24.3% in 1997 compared to 1996, the minimum value recorded in 2001, namely
an increase in profit tax of only 14.8% compared with 2000.
The statistical analysis carried out previously shows us that the two variables analyzed are
interconditioned and the values recorded in Romania from 1995 to 2008, forming a simple linear
regression of the form Pt= 507,9921 + 0,103·I
Based on statistical calculations performed to determine the regression model of investment
and profit tax, we obtained that the two variables are directly linked very closely, indicating that a
change in a certain sense of the investments size will determine changes of profit tax in the same
direction.
The close relationship between profit tax and investments, it's shown by determination's ratio
calculation, whereby 98,238% of profit tax changes can be explained due to the influence of size of
investments.


ANALYSIS ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PROFIT

Abstract: Although it is a relative old concept, having ruts in the writings of the late „60s,
globalization has become in current times a cliché, being used in many parts of the world and in many
languages but not having a specific definition. Financial globalization is considered to be the core element
of the process of globalization and consists in a complex integration of financial markets through exchange
and financial flows.
In this context, the economic agents are considered to be important players, given the fact that for
their investments they appeal to financial recourses wherever they may be. However there investment
behavior is greatly influenced by the state, through the fiscal policy, especially through a very important
instrument at its disposal, the profit tax rate.
The aim of this paper is to emphasize the evolution of the relationship between the profit tax and
investments, in the case of Romania from 1990 until 2008, trying to show particular developments of each of
this two variables studied and the relations between them, the amplitude of influence exercised by them. The
paper also focuses upon a better understanding of how the variables analyzed influence the real economy in
this globalized environment.

1. Introduction

The performance of the economic activity in any country is directly dependent on the
development capacity, on the profitability and return on economic activities of the enterprises, the
basic economic links.

2. Financial literature regarding the concept of investment
A special place in the decisions of a company is occupied by the investments decision, which
is considered the most important financial decision. The importance of those decisions is evidenced
by the direct influence they have on the degree of liquidity of the company, because investment
decisions influence the way how available cash resources are allocated efficiently by a company to
replace old equipment, technical modernization and improvement etc. to perform the better manner
of functioning of the company to ensure the highest optimum parameters. The decision to invest, is
an important decision, with which company is facing throughout the period of its existence, usually
this kind of decision is irreversible (Gudji, 2001, p.273).
Seen through the prism of its complexity, the notion of investment has been defined in the
literature in several ways, namely:


Financial – investment is seen as an immediate payment in view of future earnings or

capital immobilization, order to achieve a capital gain over several periods (Brezeanu, 2009, p.36);


Accountant – represents the amounts allocated for investment of fixed assets such as

land, buildings, industrial machinery, patents, licenses, equity and others, including all three
categories of property: intangible, tangible and financial;


Legal – the investments are reprezented of any acquisitions or investments cover the

elements that constitute the subject of a property as a heritage elements: rural and urban households,
productive equipment, vehicles, securities, money (Onofrei, 2003, p. 194);


Monetary – investments are regarded as "all expenses incurred to obtain monetary

income in the future" (Teodorescu and Vasile, 2005, p.208). Under this approach, all expenditure
incurred within a business are included in investment, without taking account of their object, in this
case the concept of investment is overlap over the notion of cost.


Psychological – focuses on the ability of an individual or company to give up at

money or goods in exchange for future assets, which will reward time period in which the person
has gave up his resources , expected inflation and the risk (uncertainty of achieving future
earnings).
By linking all meanings attributed to the concept of investment, we can define its scope, as all
action of long-term immobilization of all current resources: money, material and human resources
in order to obtain in the future higher incomes than those which could be obtained today.
3. Investment in Romania after the ‘90
In post-revolutionary Romania, where private property rights revert to its natural, people have
been concerned with the development of activities generating tangible or intangible benefits. This
has led to strong growth in the number of private economic entities, which have always been
interested in increasing the profitability of their activities, goal they wanted to achieve by investing.
This trend of commercial activities development, which was undertaken in Romania, can be
seen from the value and volume increase of investments from 1990 to 2008, how we can see from
the following table:

What is noteworthy is that in the early '90s, the biggest share of the investment was owned by
construction, while the share of investments in various technological equipment, although not a
very big difference, have a lower value. This would later change, because since 1993 the share of
investment in construction and the share of investment in equipment has been reversed, as in
Romania of that time showed a continuous increase in the share of investment in equipment, namely
the productive capital, while the investment in construction was dropping, but there are two
exceptions represented by the years 1995 and 2005, when the construction component had a high
value than technological equipment.

Another important aspect that emerges from analysis of data from Table 1 is related to the
dynamic performance of investments made in Romania. This element is highlighted in the
following graphic:

It can be seen, that investments have developed very quickly, especially in the period 1990 1994, a stage in which the investments made in Romania have increased from one year to another in
the following way: the value of investments in 1991 were 80% higher than in 1990, while the next
three years were characterized by an approximate tripling of the value of investments from one year
to another. However, this growth seems to be considered taking into account the dramatic economic
situation it was in Romania in the early 90s, a period characterized by an acute inflation which
reached an average of over 256 percent in the period 1990 to 1994, according to the Report Inflation

amount of investment in Romania in the early years of the last decade, not due to an increase in real
value but rather an artificial increase due to rampant inflation that characterized Romania from that
time.
Concerning the last time, from 2000 until 2008, the value of investments increased from one
year to another with an average of about 30%. This growth was sustained by the steady economic
environment, characterized by an inflation rate reduced by an amount which has not exceeded 20
percent since early 2002.
Another element that should not be overlooked in the analysis of investment development in
Romania is represented by the sources from which those investments were made, with emphasis on
the evolution of foreign capital sources.

As can be seen in the previous graphic, investments that have foreign capital as a source of
funding, have increased since 2005, a trend which can be partially explained by the profit tax
system, because from January 1, 2005 the current flat profit tax was reduced at 16% by the
Government Emergency Ordinance no. 138/2004, amending the Tax Code, a development that was
also anticipated in the economic literature (Martin, 2006, p.144).

4. Changes of the profit tax rate and their implications

The revolution from 1989 brought major changes at all levels of political, economical and
social from Romania. This shift from a socialist state in which the central element was represented

initiate profitable business, required significant changes in the Romanian legislation concerning the
tax system.
The fact that, until 1990 was only one owner – the state, determined "subjective and
automatically transfer of the benefits to the state budget” (Corduneanu, 1998, p.549), but once with
the transition to a democratic society by redefining property rights and the establishment of
economic agents who had private or mixed capital (public and private), the state had to create a
legislative framework to govern the enterprises obligations on their profit.
No. 12/1991 Profit Tax Law, is one that opens the long and hard road of rules relating to
taxable profit, these rules were constantly evolving in light of the real businesses life. All laws,
ordinances and resolutions that have followed, tried to explain and to fill gaps in previous
legislation or were made in order to facilitate the private sector in economic development and meet
the requirements for Romania's accession to the European Union.
Initially, in 1991, Law no. 12 established progressive tax rates which ranged between 0% and
77%, who was applied only to fiscal year 1991, because at the end of the year, the Government
Decision no. 804 imposed the use of progressive tax rates from 1st January 1992. But neither the
adoption of this quota system has failed to achieve a legislative stability, because in 1994 a further
amendment was decided by the Government Ordinance no. 70, which established transition to the
flat tax system, at that time was of 38%.
Although, until present, the tax legislation remained constant, but about the tax system and
profit tax rate we can’t say the same thing. The flat tax level has varied in the sense of diminishing,
leading now to a share 16%, effective from 1 January 2005.
Profit tax is one of the major revenue of the state budget, which has a relatively high share in
total budgetary revenues.
By analyzing data obtained from the site of the National Institute of Statistics, we can observe
the variation of participation the profit tax at forming the fiscal revenues from stat budget, so
between 1991-1997 the participation in the state budget is an average rate of 21.5%, ranging from a
minimum rate of 19.2%, in 1996, to a maximum rate of 24.3% recorded in 1997. In 1998 is
recorded a fall in share of revenues from profit tax owned in the state budget revenues by 8
percentage points, which is shown in the graphic below.

Source: processed data accesed on 15.10.2010 at http://www.insse.ro/cms/files/pdf/ro/cap21.pdf

Since 1998, the share of revenues from profit tax in budget state revenues is relatively low,
maintaining a downward trend between 1999 to 2001, when the share of profit tax reaches the
minimum value recorded so far in post-revolutionary Romania namely 14.8% of total revenues.
Thereafter, the rate of participation in forming the profit tax revenues has an upward trend, reaching
20% in 2004, and in the following year, 2005, to a further decrease, reaching 17.7 %.
Share declining of revenues from profit tax in budget state revenues in 2005, can be partially
explained by approving the flat income tax of 16%, event which caused on short-term this decline,
but had a long-term effect positive, whereas stimulated reinvestment of profits obtained by
economic entities, increasing the productive activities, which in subsequent years was reflected in
an increase in revenues generated by the economic agents and finally the taxable profit, resulting in
an upward trend of revenues from profit tax in budget state revenues.

5. Statistical analysis of the correlation between investments and profit tax in Romania

The two variables, investments and profit tax, whose evolution has been previously analyzed,
are not independent, because each exercise some influence over the other one.


The state is one who, in different stages of economic development, acting through legislative
acts issued in fiscal perspective it would follow, on this case the main instrument of action is
represented by the profit tax rate, which directly affects the volume size of profit tax and the
remaining amount to the company which can be used for different purposes, most important being
represented by the investment.
The profit tax size influences the size of investment, investment which in turn leads to the
creation of new value, which again is divided in several destinations, the two most important being
represented by investments and profit tax. As a result, it is clear the multiplier effect of investments,
which is closely related to the correlation with profit tax.
In trying to determine the correlation between investment and profit tax in Romania, I used as
a sample, the value of investments and profit tax (million current prices) between 1995 and 2008, a
period which includes a number of 14 years. In selecting this sample we left from premise of the
existence in time of invariant features for the two variables, so we have chosen 1995 as base year
because starting 1st January 1995 was introduced in Romania the rate proportional tax system, a
system that remained until now, although the tax rate has varied over time and reduced the value of
38% to 16% (from 1 January 2005).

As it can be seen in the previous graphic, between profit tax and investment made in Romania
during 1995 - 2008, there is a relationship of proportionality between changes in profit tax and
changes in investment.
Based on the stated sample, the relationship between variables can be estimated by simple
linear regression model equation of the form Y = a + bX, where Y will be variable profit tax, which
I will note Pt, X will be variable Investment, noted by I, a and b are the values of model parameters
of the regression estimators.
The two model parameters, a and b, are determined based on the following relationships,
given the statistical literature (Jaba, 2002, pp.381-382), namely:

Using the program EViews program we calculated the estimated equation, which is
synthesized in the following table:

Equation (3) is plotted in Graphic 5 by the blue line, indicating that the evolution of the
relationship between income and investments in Romania during 1995-2008 does not fluctuate very
much from this landmark.
Along with defining the regression line, which showing the link between profit tax and
investments, it should be measured and the intensity of this relationship, highlighting the degree of
concentration or dispersion of the values on which profit tax has had in reality around the regression
line, which consists of theoretical values.
Intensity relationship can be measured using the correlation coefficient (Jaba, 2002, pp.390391), which may take a value between -1 and +1, if the correlation coefficient has a value closer to 1 or +1, the relationship between those two variables is closer, while its value is more close to 0,
this indicates the absence of a link between the two variables.

According to calculations made in EViews we obtained correlation coefficient value of

linked very closely.

Besides the foregoing, we can ask a question, namely: "In what proportion are influenced
profit tax by investments?", To this questions, we can respond by estimating the ratio determination,
which expresses the factor X influence the changes in variable Y and is calculated in case of a
linear regression, as is the case at hand, the following formula:

Following the calculations for the regression model of investments and profit tax, we obtained
a value  2 = 0.98238, which shows that 98.238% of profit tax variation can be explained by of
investments value made in Romania during 1995-2008.

6. Conclusions

Investments and profit tax are two macroeconomic variables that influence in a strongly way a
country's economic life, how happened in Romania in the last 15 years. But these two variables do

by the other one, thing which was highlighted in this paper.
Following what we said above, we can see that after the transition to a market economy, the
occurrence of private economic entities, there was a continued increase in investment in Romania,
since 1990 until now.
An item that is noted in the study of the investments evolution in Romania is the accelerated
development of foreign capital investments since 2005, when we can see that the value of foreign
investments was 4 times higher in two years. This development can partly be explained in
conjunction with the tax system, since the entry into force on 1 January 2005 a flat profit tax
reduced at 16%. This has determinate increasing the value of foreign investments and the fact that
foreign investors were attracted by the reduced rate of profit tax, which allowed them to obtain a
high profit. At the same time it should be noted that foreign investments could be greater if the
public authority would issued the laws that would ensure greater stability of the tax system.
The amount of profit tax collected at the state budget took an upward trend, each year
recorded a higher value than that obtained in the previous year, although the proportion with
increased amount of profit tax varied widely in last 15 years . Noteworthy is the maximum amount
of growth, namely 24.3% in 1997 compared to 1996, the minimum value recorded in 2001, namely
an increase in profit tax of only 14.8% compared with 2000.
The statistical analysis carried out previously shows us that the two variables analyzed are
interconditioned and the values recorded in Romania from 1995 to 2008, forming a simple linear
regression of the form Pt= 507,9921 + 0,103·I
Based on statistical calculations performed to determine the regression model of investment
and profit tax, we obtained that the two variables are directly linked very closely, indicating that a
change in a certain sense of the investments size will determine changes of profit tax in the same
direction.
The close relationship between profit tax and investments, it's shown by determination's ratio
calculation, whereby 98,238% of profit tax changes can be explained due to the influence of size of
investments.
