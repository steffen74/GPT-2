This paper analyses a new concept as ISO 26000
and its role in promoting the corporate social
responsibility (CSR) disclosure. As a new standard,
ISO 26000 established in 2010 in order to
enhance organizations to disclosure more about
the effect of their activities on Society. This standard reveals a new form of ethics of standardization, by a formalization and structuring of
customary international practices in the field of
social responsibility. So, we test the reaction of
Saudi companies to the implementation of ISO
26000; on the other hand, we studied the relationship between CSR reporting and information
asymmetry. The findings are useful to signify the
scope of CSR and sustainability after implementing the ISO 26000. Also, we conclude the existence of bidirectional relationship between CSR
reporting and information asymmetry.

1. Introduction
This research aims to examine the role of ISO 26000 in promoting the CSR reporting made by Saudi
companies. Precisely, this paper attempts to explore the effect of the implementation of the new
standard ISO 26000 on the level of CSR reporting.
CSR concerns not only businesses but also shareholders, such as governments and civil societies.
CSR is not limited to the developed world or to its Anglo-American origins. Certainly, the current
growth in CSR is more marked in Europe and in some Asian countries (e.g., Japan, Taiwan, etc.),
and the growth of India and China as main actors in the global economy has included CSR. The
existence of large businesses in the developed world is contended by many as being one of the
most solid drivers of CSR, not only in Western multinationals but also in indigenous firms.
The idea of conducting a study on a context of underdeveloped countries emanates from a first
reading of the reports published by Saudi companies, for example by examining the website of
SABIC, one of the biggest chemical companies in Saudi Arabia, we discovered the presence of
a rubric for sustainability. This rubric includes elements related to CSR, energy and resources
efficiency.
Nevertheless, in recent years, we have seen the attention given to CSR by the oil-producing Gulf
countries. Petroleum firms need to increase their socially responsible consciousness in addition to
putting into practice an ethical and environmental vision. Indeed, firms are being increasingly
viewed as examples of hope regarding combating poverty by upgrading economically and highlighting alternatives in otherwise often less-governed organizations and economies.
Some institutions that adopted normalization developed certification related to CSR. Large
international consultancy organizations prefer to be included in the global reporting initiative
(GRI) to consolidate their reporting efforts. This reporting is also a political objective, and some
governments supported obligatory reporting at the Rio+ 20 conference, the proceedings of which
were published (paragraph 47). Although this provision is not obligatory, these countries comprise
a group of friends (paragraph 47), which include corporate reporting in their sustainable development practices. Although incomplete according to the ISO 26000 standard, it is one of the
significant contributions that could be a vector of diffusion of international law beyond the screen
of the States. It is paradoxical that under the patronage of the UN Secretary-General, the Global
Compact has lower standards than the ISO 26000, and it is deemed a private initiative. In Figure 1,
we show the links between the concepts related to CSR reporting.

Thereby, through this paper we seek to address the impact of the introduction of this new
standard on the disclosure of social responsibility in the climate of developing countries such as
Gulf region. In a second time we will treat the relationship between CSR disclosure and the
asymmetry of information. Several theories support this option, most notably the agency theory,
the resource dependence theory, signaling theory and legitimacy theory.
The rest of the paper is subdivided into 6 other sections: the next section discusses the background related the concept of CSR, the third section presents a theoretical literature especially
about CSR in Saudi Arabia and the new concept of ISO 26000, then the forth section reviews
literature and the development of hypotheses, the following section treats the research design
(the sample and the variables), the seventh section presents the empirical results and discussion,
and finally we present the summary and the conclusion.

2. Background
According to the United Nations Environment Program (Ciroth et al., 2011), CSR is understood to be
the practice of voluntary self-regulation by economic entities. Although CSR is generally voluntary
in most countries, organizations are currently under increasing pressure by public claims.
CSR used to be thought of as relating merely to aid and volunteerism. However, according to the
current CSR philosophy, these are minor aspects of CSR (Perrini, 2006). The concept is much wider
and has serious strategic consequences. (Yeung, 2011) recognized that the need for liability and
clarity in all organizational sectors is increasing. Consequently, organizations that are not concerned with the requirements and prospects of their stakeholders will be less competitive in
relation to those who are concerned. In addition, Lim and Greenwood (2017) observed that the
current corporate environment is very active and very competitive, which requires organizations to
include social, environmental, corporate governance, and stakeholders’ concerns in their policies in
order to remain competitive. In general, the current operating environment is different from the
old one, which is why it is referred to as the new economy.
Overall, the work of an organization in relation to its environmental impact on the local community has become a precarious measure of its global status and its capability of functioning
efficiently (Hemphill, 2013; Sitnikov & Bocean, 2012). Sitnikov and Bocean (2012) indicated that the
specific and important role of CSR is seen to be that of reconciling differences arising between firm
profits and social objectives. They clarified that a CSR program enables managers to be aware of
these conflicts and helps them address subsequent problems. Indeed, Perrini (2006) noted that
CSR is seen as a way of doing business responsibly.
In it most comprehensive definition, CSR is perceived as a complete set of strategies, practices,
and planning, which are combined in business operations, supply chains, and decision-making
processes in the firm. CSR includes the responsibility for existing and past actions as well as the
attention to future impacts (Masud, 2011). Ávila et al. (2013) attested to the benefits of sustained
social responsibility for many firms that have embraced it in economic areas. In the same context,
Karagiorgos (2010) provided empirical evidence that suggested the adoption of CSR strategy
enables the firm to be valued positively by both the market and its stakeholders.
In this work we introduce an important factor related to sustainability and CSR such as the ISO
26000. This standard was developed by an ISO working group consisting of 450 experts and 210
observers from 99 ISO member countries and another 42 liaison organizations. While there has
been a propagation of social responsibility-related rule tools at the universal level in recent years,
and all of these tools are innovative, the ISO 26000 standard is chosen here for consideration as
a main breakthrough or disorderly innovation in the emerging universal social responsibility rule
planning, by reason of a number of distinguishing features which are well-defined below.


These typical characteristics of ISO 26000 have a main behavior on the glimpsed legitimacy of
this standard as a handout of what founds desirable and undesirable social responsibility conduct
by the most organizations (Moratis, 2016). These characteristics also constitute a source for the
proposals submitted here that ISO 26000 is an official announcement of universal social responsibility practice, and that ISO 26000 is an exclusive linking tool, in terms of public–private relations
on social responsibility matters (Moratis, 2017).
CSR in Saudi Arabia, designed to be the ideal path for private organizations, helps Saudi society
achieve progress in two ways: (1) the intentional “Saudification” of the workforce and (2) the
expansion and diversification of the economy that, at present, is largely reliant on the energy
sector. While Saudi Arabia’s CSR approach stresses the importance of a national workforce and
broad economic portfolio, the Saudi government’s awareness of the need for environmental
protection dates back to 1981, when it created the Meteorology and Environmental Protection
Administration and the Environmental Protection Coordinating Committee. Certainly, several other
decisions have also been made to further acknowledge societal responsibility .
ISO 26000 is a standard issued by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in
2010 and offers guidelines on how businesses and other organizations can operate in a socially
responsible way. To evaluate the extent of disclosure concerning ISO 26000 in Saudi Arabia, one
must analyze the efforts and initiatives deployed by the Saudi government and Saudi organizations
to enhance CSR disclosure. Several studies have researched this topic (Al-Janadi, Rahman, & Omar,
2012, 2013; Habbash, 2016; Khasharmeh & Desoky, 2013; Mahjoub, 2018; Omair Alotaibi &
Hussainey, 2016). Additionally, Al-Janadi et al. (2013) investigated the annual reports of 87
Saudi companies listed on the Saudi Arabian Stock Exchange, the Tadawul, from 2006 to 2007.
They discovered a low level of CSR reporting (14.61%) and characterized the extent of reporting
using four attributes: board size, CEO duality, audit quality, and government ownership.
Religion is an important factor when studying CSR and ISO 26000 reporting in a Saudi context.
CSR reporting in the Islamic world may be related to a social contract established on religious and
moral values (Low, Idowu, & Ang, 2013), in accordance with the larger assessment system of an
Islamic society, instead of being related to personal ethical convictions. From an Islamic perspective, the notion of benevolence to others is a main driver determining people’s responsibility visa-vis their society (Duthler & Dhanesh, 2018; Low et al., 2013).

3. Theoretical literature review
Negotiations took 5 years before the final version of the ISO 26000 standard was completed, and they
involved an international working group and national commissions in over 90 countries (Zinenko
et al., 2015). Defining the nature of a socially responsible firm is an incredibly complex undertaking,
necessitating analysis that accounts for a wide variety of issues, actions, and features. Therefore, it is
challenging to fully classify the extent of a firm’s social responsibility (Enderwick, 2018).
ISO 26000 focuses on creating guiding principles, as opposed to strict specifications for certification. Thus, no organization can obtain an ISO 26000 certification, as it could for other standards.
Likewise, the objective of ISO 26000 is not to define a system through a set of requirements. The
standard simply describes concrete forms of social responsibility, outlined to support organizations’ contributions to continuously sustainable development. (Moratis & Cochius, 2017).
Zinenko et al. (2015) explained that members within the negotiating process were separated
into stakeholder groups, each spanning governments, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs),
firms, etc., to ensure that the standard obtained the consensus of all stakeholders.
Consequently, ISO 26000 addresses the impacts of organizations across different sectors and in
developed and developing countries (Enderwick, 2018). The standard is recognized as a globally
harmonized guidance pertinent to all types of organizations (Sitnikov & Bocean, 2012). Castka and


Balzarova (2008) stated that ISO 26000 is accurately considered a holistic standard because it
includes the environment, social issues, health and safety, emissions, and much more. Moreover, it
is praised for making sustainable development the predominant goal of organizational social
responsibility.(Zinenko et al., 2015).
Fundamentally, the standard delivers an understanding of what social responsibility is and what
is obligatory to work in a socially responsible manner (Sitnikov & Bocean, 2012). It offers a clear
guide to organizations for combining their financial interests with environmental and social gains
when conducting daily operations (Moratis & Cochius, 2017). As explained by Hemphill (2013), ISO
26000 discusses seven core subjects of social responsibility, as shown in Figure 2.

4. Literature review and hypotheses development
We have continued the research into CSR in Saudi Arabia with the formulation of our hypotheses.
Various results drawn from previous studies were used in the formulation of the hypotheses. First,
we attempted to determine the level of ISO 26000 reporting made by Saudi companies. Second,
we assessed the factors that determine this extent of reporting.

4.1. The level of ISO 26000 reporting made by saudi companies
After our literature review, we concluded that there is a paucity of research about CSR in the Saudi
context. The few studies that do exist have focused on CSR reporting levels, and no one has studied
the extent of ISO 26000 disclosure made by Saudi companies.
When Mandurah, Khatib, and Al-Sabaan (2012) examined CSR activities in Saudi Arabia, they
found a reasonable level of CSR activities within Saudi businesses and an adequate link between
social objectives and the strategic objectives of the companies. In the same context, however,
Macarulla and Talalweh (2012) studied the determinants of corporate social reporting practices in
Saudi companies and found a low level of CSR reporting.
Several existing theories seek to explain the determinants of societal disclosure and CSR reporting. Combining all empirical results within one theoretical framework remains a daunting task;
therefore, analyzing CSR reporting, as well as aligning the analysis with the guidelines of the ISO
26000 standard, is a complex process that cannot be clarified by one theory. Many studies in this
domain have based their postulations on agency theory, signal theory, and legitimacy theory.
In regards to agency theory, organizations’ voluntary reporting, especially on social and environmental aspects, is a means to minimize current or future agency costs that may ensue in the

form of government oversight. Reducing such costs affects the risk profile and profitability of
organizations and thus influences performance. (Duthler & Dhanesh, 2018).
From the same perspective, signaling theory suggests that companies which communicate
about environmental concerns send a signal that they are engaged in environmental strategy.
They are encouraged to inform different stakeholders by voluntarily reporting more information.
Consequently, these affirmative signals make the organizations more attractive to investors in the
stock market (Kao, Yeh, Wang, & Fung, 2018).
According to legitimacy theory, CSR reporting provides information that legitimizes an organization’s comportment with the aim of affecting stakeholders’ and ultimately society’s insights about
the organization, resulting in a higher performance (Duthler & Dhanesh, 2018).
Finally, the resource dependence theory postulates that the organization seeks to reduce the
uncertainty associated with its environment. According to this model, organizations must identify
their dependencies on their environment and seek to overcome the control exercised by different
actors through initiatives such as acquisition, lobbying or alliance (Hillman, Withers, & Collins,
2009). They remain in business only to the extent that they manage the requirements of the
interest groups whose depend on for their resources. Preffer and Salancik (1978), at the origin of
the theory, note the lack of knowledge of the interdependencies that exist between the company
and certain groups of actors. In particular, they consider that organizations underestimate the
demands of external groups and the complex relationships that are forming with other organizations. According to these authors, it is important to recognize that the environment constrains or
affects organizations.

Hypothesis 1 We predict a high level of CSR reporting through ISO 26000 made by Saudi listed
companies.

4.2. Determinants of CSR reporting within ISO 26000
4.2.1. Effect of firm size on ISO 26000 reporting
The size of the company is seen as the main factor in societal disclosure. In fact, larger firms are under
more pressure to act and disclose information about the effects of their activities (Mahjoub, 2018).
Although the standard applies to all companies, the cost of adopting this standard is high for
smaller firms, especially in terms of setting up the necessary devices. On the other hand, large
companies are targeted by governments, and subsequently are more obligated to be in compliance with regulations.
Gnanaweera and Kunori (2018) found that firm size is the main variable related to voluntary
disclosure. Duff (2016) noted that firm size and firm profitability have important and positive links
with financial disclosure. In the same context, Ibrahim, Darus, Yusoff, and Muhamad (2015) argue
that the quality of social responsibility is tentatively linked with firm size (measured by log of total
assets) in the Malaysian context.
Based on what is reported above, we state the following hypothesis:

Hypothesis 2: The size of a firm positively influences the level of CSR reporting through ISO
26000 reporting.



4.2.2. Industry sensitivity role
Some activity sectors are perceived to be socially and environmentally sensitive. Such sectors are
usually characterized by activities which cause high levels of pollution (Peters & Romi, 2013).
Macarulla and Talalweh (2012) perceived that the economic sector and profitability play noteworthy roles in explaining the extent of CSR reporting. Firms in socially-sensitive and environmentally-sensitive sectors such as the forestry, petroleum and chemical sectors, particularly the ones
which accomplish best societal performance, are the ones perceived to report the maximum
societal information (Mahjoub & Khamoussi, 2013; Raufflet, Cruz & Bres, 2014). The problem,
however, is the credibility and quality of the information disclosed. In this area, Cormier and
Magnan (2015) argue that the applicability of environmental reporting is significantly reduced
for companies which belong to socially-sensitive and environmentally-sensitive sectors.
Furthermore, societal reporting is criticized by interested parties because firms operating in
socially-sensitive and environmentally-sensitive sectors have a tendency to communicate “poorly”
and provide vague information about the effects of their activities (Braam, de Weerd, Hauck, &
Huijbregts, 2016). Consequently, it is difficult for an interested party to differentiate between
credible and opportunistic societal reporting.
Based on the above discussion, we can formulate the following hypothesis:

Hypothesis 3: The firms in sensitive sectors are less credible when they report about CSR through
ISO 26000.

4.2.3. Leverage as determinant of CSR reporting
According to the Cormier and Gordon (2001) study of Canadian companies, environmental communication is influenced by leverage and the use of new financing. By testing the link between the debt ratio and
societal disclosure, Belkaoui and Karpik (1989) argue that the greater the debts of an organization, the
less the company will communicate social and environmental information. In the same context, Cormier
and Magnan (1999) have shown that leverage has a negative and significant influence on environmental
disclosure. (Oxibar, 2003, 2009) found a negative link between a company’s leverage and societal
disclosure in its annual reports. On the other hand, Roberts (1992) considers that leverage is likely to
encourage the company to carry out societal activities and to be positive with regard to the information
reported in order to meet the expectations of its creditors in term of its social role. Author expects
a positive link between the firm’s leverage and its level of societal reporting.
In this respect, it is thought that:

Hypothesis 4: The most indebted firms have more incentive to disclose about CSR through ISO
26000.

4.3. Effect of CSR reporting on information asymmetry
Information asymmetry arises when stockholders retain private information about the organization’s
value, but other uninformed stockholders only have access to public information (Rezaee & Tuo, 2017).
According to signaling theory, disclosure principally makes private information available to all and can
consequently diminish information asymmetry (Huang, Li, & Zhang, 2019). Information asymmetry is
similarly a mean subject on its own because a great deal of the literature suggests that the occurrence
of information asymmetry generates a contrary selection difficulty, discourages effective resource
distribution and intensifies a company’s obligatory rate of returns. In relation to the effect of societal
disclosure on the asymmetry of information, Rezaee and Tuo (2017) argue that non-disclosure can
afford benefits for organizations by decreasing information asymmetry.


Information asymmetry theory specifies that one party, vis-a-vis an operation, has more pertinent information than others. In fact, Diamond and Verrecchia (1991) show that a low level of
reporting or a lack of disclosure can encourage investors to withhold information and keep it
secret; thus, this results in a great deal of information asymmetry.
We can formulate the following hypothesis:

Hypothesis 5 The more Saudi companies disclose in the process of CSR reporting, the more they
can avoid information asymmetry.

5. Research design
5.1. Population and sample
The choice to include Saudi companies in the study is based on the regional place of the Kingdom
of Saudi Arabia and the existence of its oil and petroleum resources. These companies, which
belong to industries which are often perceived as being polluters, represent the best and the most
effective proof of their capability to disclose social and environmental information in the presence
of the ISO 26000 standard (Raufflet et al., 2014).
“During the decade of 2003 to 2013, it almost doubled in size on the back of a protracted oil
boom” (McKinsey Company, 2015).
Therefore, the sample is extracted from a population of Saudi-listed companies that excludes financial
institutions, service industries, and firms that do not have updated websites (see the appendix).
The final list of the companies included in the sample includes 89 companies belonging to 7
industries during a 3-year period (2015–2017), resulting in 267 observations. Our data was collected from “tadawul,” “argaam,” and “asmainfo”1 Saudi websites and the annual reports of the
sample companies.

5.2. Models
Before focusing on variable measurement, we first present the two empirical models that were
used to examine the causal relationships between our variables. We added two control variables,
audit quality (AUDT) and volume of sales (SALS), to increase the robustness of the model.
Model 1:
DISCit ¼ a0 þ a1 SIZEit þ a2 INDSit þ a3 LVRGit þ a4 AUDTit þ a5 SALS þ βit
i= 1, 2, 3, …, 89.
t= 1, 2, 3.
Where:
DISC = level of CSR disclosure through ISO 26000
SIZE = size of firm i in year t
INDS = the firm i among the sensitive industries or not
LVRG: Leverage of firm i in year t

SALS: amount of sales of firm i in year t
AUDT: audit quality, binary variable (1 if auditor from big four auditors, 0
otherwise)
To test the second model, which determines the effect of CSR reporting through ISO 26000 on
information asymmetry, we suggest that some of the control variables used in prior studies and an
equation in which the dependent variable represents the degree of information asymmetry (INAS)
and the explanatory “CSR reporting through ISO 26000” (DISC) are applicable to our research:
Model 2:
INASit ¼ α0 þ α1DISCit þ α2SIZEit þ α3AUDTit þ α4SALSit þ α4LVRGit þ βit :
All variables are described previously.

5.3. Variables measurement
5.3.1. CSR reporting through ISO 26000
Chapter six of ISO 26000, called “Guidance on Social Responsibility Core Subjects,” is dedicated to
the core subjects of societal responsibility and the issues of each. The most commonly used
method to measure this variable is content analysis. Content analysis is a qualitative methodology
used in the social sciences and humanities. We find, for example, content analysis approaches
used in sociology, communication, linguistics, and psychology research (Duff (2016) and Liao, Xu,
Cheng, and Dong (2018)).
Content analysis is a coding process used when searching for required information about CSR and
ISO 26000 in the annual and/or special reports (social responsibility reports, sustainable development
reports, etc.) published by companies (Mahjoub & Khamoussi, 2013). The measurement of CSR
reporting through ISO 26000 is based on an index (Appendix 2) that contains items related to
different subjects associated with CSR, sustainability, GRI guidelines, and the core subjects of ISO
26000. These items are based on Omair Alotaibi and Hussainey (2016) and ISO 26000 core subjects.
We attempt to rate these items by assigning them values for existing or inexistent information;
the given values are between zero and three. Three points are conferred to items described in
monetary or quantitative terms, two points go to items that are described explicitly, one point is
awarded to items presented in general terms (without specific details), and zero points are given to
inexistent items (Lassaad & Khamoussi, 2012a, 2012b; Mahjoub & Khamoussi, 2013).

5.3.2. Measure of explanatory variables and control variables
a) Firm size (SIZE)
The firm size has been measured in previous studies by different parameters such as market
capitalisation, total revenues, and total assets (Pütter, 2017). Reverte (2009) measured the firm
size by the logarithm of market capitalization. On the other hand, many studies use the logarithm
of total assets (Cormier and Magnan (2015), Ibrahim et al. (2015), Timbate and Park (2018)). For
this reason, authors have the necessary arguments to justify their choices, which correspond to
their studies; in our case, we choose to use the total assets logarithm.
b) Sensitive industry (INDS)
After reviewing the literature, we attempt to measure the “sensitive industry” variable using
a dummy variable. Timbate and Park (2018) use Compustat’s one-digit SIC2 as source of industries
classification, Cormier and Magnan (2015) used a sensitive industry as a binary variable (one if


a company belongs to an environmentally sensitive industry, zero otherwise). According to the
study of (Reverte, 2009), the list of “‘more sensitive’” industries are: “mining, oil and gas, chemicals, forestry and paper, steel and other metals, electricity, gas distribution, and water”. The rest of
the sectors are classified under ‘“less sensitive”, the author measures also this variable by a one/
zero. Therefore, we adopt this measure in our study. So, we assign a value of one to the group of
companies categorised as sensitive industries and a value of zero to the group of companies
categorised as non-sensitive industries.
c) Leverage (LVRG)
In general, leverage is measured through many ratios (such as the debt-to-equity ratio, the debt-tocapital ratio, and the debt-to-EBITDA ratio). For example, Martínez-Ferrero, Ruiz-Cano, and
García-Sánchez (2016) and Husted and de Sousa-Filho (2018) measured the leverage by the ratio of
total debts to total equity. In others studies such us Timbate and Park (2018) and Fuente, García-Sanchez,
and Lozano (2017) the variable of leverage equal to total liabilities scaled by total assets.
Due to the availability of the data, we will use in this research the use the ratio of total liabilities
to total assets.
d) Information Asymmetry (INAS)
After a review of the literature on information asymmetry, we choose a measure: the absolute
value of earnings per share (EPS) minus the median of forecasted EPS. The result is scaled to share
prices. Recently, this measure was used by Martínez-Ferrero et al. (2016), who were inspired by
Lang and Lundholm (1996), Marquardt and Wiedman (1998), and Lang and Lundholm (2000).
Below, we present the equation used to measure information asymmetry:
Information Asymmetry ¼

jEPS  median of forecasted EPSj
Share price

When this ratio returns lower values, it indicates a greater disposal of information and, consequently, less asymmetric information.

6. Empirical results and discussion
6.1. Result of “CSR reporting through ISO 26000” rating
6.1.1. Descriptive analysis
Upon examining the results in Table 1, we note that the dependent variable (CSR reporting through
ISO 26000) has a mean score of 1.503 (scoring values fall between 0 and 3). This score reveals an
average level of information disclosure on CSR through ISO 26000. We compare this finding to
similar results in Saudi contexts; for example, the study by Habbash (2016) conducted from 2007
to 2011 (just after the implementation of ISO 26000). In this study, the author found a 24%
disclosure. Other studies also reported levels of disclosure inferior to that found in our study. This
may be due to Saudi companies’ awareness of social and environmental concerns and the large
period to get around the guidelines of ISO 26000.
In our sample we have 186 observations classified as sensitive industry from 267 observations,
this affirmation confirms the importance of rules and legislations established by Saudi government
in reinforcing the reporting about CSR and the protection of environment.
Conversely, the percentage of companies audited by the Big Four auditors is 38.20%. This is
insufficient, particularly because we understand the roles of large auditing firms in improving
levels of disclosure (Duff, 2016).

Using Figure 3, we notice that levels of disclosure increased from 2015 to 2017; this may have
resulted from the Corporate Governance Code in Saudi Arabia, the rigor of the Saudi Capital Market
Law, and the Presidency of Metrology and Environment. To better steward and highlight environmental issues, the Saudi government established King Abdullah University of Science and
Technology in 2009, which focuses on researching renewable energies.
By analyzing the disclosure over the sector of activity (Table 2), we note that the mean score of
the disclosure in the Energy & Utilities sector is higher than the mean score of all other sectors.
This result makes sense: we know that this sector is most concerned about communication
regarding the effects of these activities on the company and the community in general and that

6.1.2. Pre-tests (multi-collinearity and autocorrelation problems)
Concerning the problem of auto-correlation, Table 3 shows a good result for a majority of relationships between variables. For the remaining instances of auto-correlation, we will choose a suitable
tool for multiple regression (a suitable predictor in the Stata software) in Model 1.
Multi-collinearity is detected when explanatory variables in the model are correlated. Regarding
Table 4, in which we used a vector of inflation factor, there is no serious problem of multicollinearity in our study.

6.1.3. Result of multiple regression for the model 1
Results of the first model, as shown in Table 5, prove that the disclosure about CSR through the ISO
26000 made by Saudi-listed companies is affected significantly by the sensitivity of the industry,
firm size, sales, and quality of the audit. These relationships are all significant at 1%. Concerning

the effect of the size, our findings support previous studies in developing countries, which postulate that firm size positively affects the CSR (Colaço & Simão, 2018; Khasharmeh & Desoky, 2013).
Therefore, implementation of the new standard ISO 26000 further strengthens the role of firm size
(Moratis, 2017). The second positive concerns the quality of the audit (AUDT); this result is justified
by the presence of four big audit companies in Saudi Arabia (our sample includes 102 observations
from 267 companies). Many other studies in the field, including Appuhami and Tashakor (2017),
LópezPuertas-Lamy, Desender, and Epure (2017), and Alotaibi and Hussainey (2016), support this
finding.
We also noted that leverage does not significantly affect this disclosure; this result stems from
a poor level of leverage in the Saudi companies. Our finding is aligned with the majority of previous
research. For example, the study by Bae, El Ghoul, Guedhami, Kwok, and Zheng (2018) found that
leverage plays a moderator role in the relationship between CSR and the loss in market share. In
the same context, Sheikh (2018) argues that the link between CSR and leverage is affected by
competitiveness in the market. Reverte (2009) affirms that companies whose disclose more about
CSR have a lower leverage because these companies are listed in foreign stock markets, this is the
case of some Saudi companies (such as Sabic and Kingdom Holding Company).

6.2. Test of the model 2: effect of disclosure about CSR through ISO 26000 on information
asymmetry
We recall the statistical model that studied the effects of the disclosure about CSR through the ISO
26000 in Saudi Arabia. We reinforce this model through the use of control variables. The results of
the Stata 15 software output for this model are shown in Table 6.
INASit ¼ α0 þ α1DISCit þα2SIZEit þα3LVRGit þα4SALSit þα5INDSit þβit

Regarding Table 6, we note a positive and significant effect of disclosure for CSR on information
asymmetry (signification at the level of 5%). This finding is consistent with the results of the study
on different countries by Martínez-Ferrero et al. (2016), which postulates that the firms communicate more information about the effects of their activities and their adherence to environmental
regulations, especially after ISO 26000 implementation. This explains the reduction in information
asymmetry.

6.3. Complementary analysis: bidirectional relationship between CSR disclosure and
information asymmetry
Based on previous claims, Healy and Palepu (2001) advocated that firm reporting arises from the
presence of information asymmetry and agency conflicts. In the presence of asymmetric information, companies tend to disclose more non-financial information, and this has the effect of helping
investors make decisions based on optimal conditions while avoiding potential risks (Elliott &
Jacobson, 1994). On the other hand, increased disclosure can reduce the price range of the market

and can help policymakers protect themselves from more informed agents because of the asymmetry of information.
Thus, we will content ourselves with testing the effect of asymmetrical information on the level
of societal disclosure after the implementation of the ISO 26000 standard. That is, we construct
the following empirical model, with control some variables:
Model 3:
DISCit ¼η0 þη1 INASit þη2 INDSit þη3 SIZEit þη4 LVRGþη5 SALSþΩit
All variables are previously explained.
The output of Stata software shown in Table 7 presents a significant and positive effect of
information asymmetry on the disclosure of CSR through ISO 26000. Our finding is contradictory to
many other studies of this bidirectional relationship. For example, the studies of CuadradoBallesteros, Garcia-Sanchez, and Martinez Ferrero (2016) and Cormier, Ledoux, and Magnan
(2011) found a negative relationship between CSR reporting and information asymmetry.

7. Summary and conclusion
In this research, we conducted an analysis of the role of implementing ISO 26000 in reinforcing the
level of CSR reporting in Saudi Arabia. We obtained acceptable results, with our descriptive analysis
showing an increase in CSR reporting through ISO 26000. The determinants of this reporting are
not different from the majority of studies in the field: we found significant effects of the firm size,
sales, and sector sensitivity, but no significant role regarding leverage. Second, we tested the
bidirectional relationship between CSR disclosure and information asymmetry and obtained
a reciprocal effect between the both variables.
In summary, this study is of great importance and a challenge for us, given the difficulty of
context and the scarcity of data. We believe the results obtained will capture the current literature,
serve as good guides for practitioners, and, essentially, open new avenues of research. These
tracks come from anomalies of the research, especially concerning the reduced size of the sample.
For this purpose, studies with a larger sample or in other countries in the region (Gulf countries for
example) are suggested.
