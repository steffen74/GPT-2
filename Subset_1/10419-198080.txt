Abstract: Romania‟s position as one of the EU member states brought new challenges in terms of
industrial policy, in order to respond to the necessity of bringing the competitiveness level of the Romanian
economy close to the average level of the European states, by respecting the free trade principles of the
European Union. Furthermore, in the near future Romania should be able to contribute to the achievement
of the objective of transforming EU in the most competitive economy of the world. In this order, a market –
oriented industrial policy is necessary, following the European industrial policy and the sustainable
development concepts adopted by the European Commission, and based on the concept of competitiveness.
The general purpose of a balanced economic growth, sustainable development and improvement of the
economic competitiveness requires industrial policies created and implemented in tight connection with
other relevant economic policies, such as the competition policies, those aiming for a functional business
environment and those encouraging the SME development and attracting FDE, the policies in the education
and research and development fields, the structural and regional policies, the commercial policies, the
sustainable development and environment protection policies and those regarding employment and social
cohesion.

For Romania, becoming a member of the European Union involved not only benefits and
opportunities, but also obligations related to the supplementary efforts required for economic
development and enhancement of the industrial production competitiveness in order to reach a level
comparable to the European average and contributing to the achievement of the European objective
as set in the Lisbon Agenda: transforming EU in the most competitive economy of the world.
In this order, a market – oriented industrial policy is necessary, following the European industrial
policy and the sustainable development concepts adopted by the European Commission, and based
on the concept of competitiveness. The European Union adopted a coherent attitude related to the

council, through a decision of the Council from Seville in June 2002.
In Romania, as consequence of the integration and adaptation of the economic policies to
those of the European Union in view of enhancing the economic performances at a national level,
the necessity of a coherent industrial policy became obvious. Therefore, in 2004, the document
titled “Industrial Policy of Romania 2005 – 2008” was issued, establishing the main directions for
action for the industrial policy for this period. The fundaments of the industrial policy were based
on encouraging the horizontal factors determining competitiveness: human capital, research,
innovation, entrepreneurship, preservation the environment.
The industrial policy objectives for the determined period were established in correlation
with the stipulations of other national economic policies and with the European guidelines. The
main objectives of the Romanian industrial policy were defined as followig (Croitoru, Russu and
Tarhoaca, 2002, p. 2):
-

Enhancing competitiveness;

-

Increasing the role of research, development and innovation;

-

Promoting a sustainable management of natural resources and environment
protection;

-

Improving professional training and employment;

-

Developing the cooperation and industrial services as well as the public – private
partnership.

In the same time, the industrial policy priorities on medium term were defined (Croitoru,
Russu and Tarhoaca, 2002): applying the industrial policy according to the specific necessities of
each sector, improving the legislative frame favoring industry as well as the synergy of the different
policies with direct impact on industrial competitiveness.
The same document established the economic policies’ program for the period of time taken
into consideration, which assumed the legislative adaptation and creation of the institutions
compatible with those of the EU, implementing and monitoring the harmonized legislation,
improving the business environment, diversifying and modernizing the bank services, reducing
taxation related to labor costs, moving forward to the informational society, adopting a coherent
package of policies aiming to continue structural adjustments and improve competitiveness,
creating an integrated system for controlling the industrial pollution, starting the main infrastructure
projects and adapting the research and development system to the European operational structures.
The structural adjustments taken into consideration concerned the development of the
industrial sectors insuring high added values, the development of industrial clusters, technologic

structure of the companies as well as that of the management, environment rehabilitation, the
stimulation of the cooperation between the local companies, increasing the role of innovation and
technological research and starting some programs for producing and utilizing energy from
renewable resources.
The general purpose of a balanced economic growth, sustainable development and
improvement of the economic competitiveness requires industrial policies created and implemented
in tight connection with other relevant economic policies, such as the competition policies, those
aiming for a functional business environment and those encouraging the SME development and
attracting FDE, the policies in the education and research and development fields, the structural and
regional policies, the commercial policies, the sustainable development and environment protection
policies and those regarding employment and social cohesion.
The competition policy “concerns those instruments that insure the market’s fundaments and
facilitate the development of efficient and competitive companies”(Negrescu and Oprescu, 2004, p.
4). Succeeding in such policies is one of the main factors of a functional market economy and a
strong internal market. The competition policy must take into consideration the regulations
concerning the incentives granted by the state in conformity with the European Acquis, as well as
the provisions of the Law of Competition no. 21/1996 and the secondary legislation, following the
European guidelines and must insure the necessary support for the Competition Council.
The competition policy objectives (Croitoru, Russu and Tarhoaca, 2002) concern the
following aspects:
-

strengthening the authority of the Competition Council and that of the Competition
Office, in the purpose of increasing the capacity of these organisms to issue and
implement the specific regulations;

-

improving the legislation concerning the state incentives, according to the
European Acquis;

-

revising the legislation regarding the industrial parks, in conformity with the
competition regulations.

The actions meant to encourage competition concern the limitation of the action area of the
monopolies, continuing the pricing liberalization and avoiding anti-competition practices and
economic concentrations.
One of the main factors acting in a decisive manner over the growth potential of industrial
competitiveness is a viable and friendly business environment. Insuring a stable business
environment, favoring a function market economy, is one of the obligations that Romania assumed

legislative and institutional frame, increasing the investment flow, reducing bureaucracy and
fighting corruption. However, Romania is still far from having a transparent, predictable and
attractive business environment.
Developing a stable business environment is an objective that assumes a series of measures
for increasing transparency and improving the Government – business environment – civil society
dialogue, estimating the regulations’ impact over the business climate, simplifying the
administrative procedures, implementing a coherent system to monitor the foreign direct
investments volume, implementing the corporate governance principles and strengthening the
involved institutions.
One of the policies with major impact over the industrial policy actions is that of Small and
Medium Enterprises encouragement, this sector having a special significance for the market
economy development. SME are characterized by an enhanced capacity of reaction faced to the
market stimuli and of adaptation to the economic structural changes. The Romanian authorities’
policy in this field, so far, lacked coherence, the supportive periods being followed by those of total
lapse.
A coherent strategy on the SME encouragement was adopted by the Government in 2001
only, through the “Action Plan to Eliminate Certain Barriers in front of Small and Medium
Enterprises”. The plan’s objectives aimed to simplify the registration and licensing procedures for
new SME, to improve the legal environment, to reduce and simplify the taxation system, to promote
the access to financing resources and public contracts and to supply an informational system for
SME.
The priorities (Industrial Policy of Romania 2005 – 2008, 2004, p. 8) for SME
encouragement concern the creation of a favorable business environment, the development of the
competitive capacities of SME, improving SME’s access to financing resources and to the external
markets and promoting the entrepreneurship and increasing management performances.
For implementing the SME encouragement measures the National Agency for Small and
Medium Enterprises and Cooperation was created (ANIMMC), acting as national coordinator for
implementing in Romania the European Book for Small Enterprises and the European multi-annual
program for enterprises and entrepreneurship, particularly for SME.
Another factor influencing the industrial policy concerned the privatization and
restructuration measures, which concerned completing the privatization processes for the stateowned companies, monitoring the privatization contracts, restructuring the activities for maximizing

competitive industrial units.
In connection with the industrial policy and that for improving the business environment is
the FDI promotion policy. Attracting foreign capital is possible by promoting Romania’s image as a
destination for foreign investors and assisting the foreign partners in the initial phases of FDI. The
Romanian Agency for FDI was created with the purpose of issuing the FDI promotion strategy and
an adequate legislation, and acting as a contact point for the new-coming and existing investors.
The development of education, human resources and social cohesion policies plays an
important role within the industrial policy efforts. The main measures concern encouraging workers
mobility, insuring a balance between the offer and demand of labor, developing the human
resources management and, finally, insuring specialized training by a tight cooperation between the
educational system and the business environment. The strategy for increasing the employment rate
concerns the human capital development, creating new working places, encouraging both workers
and companies’ adaptability to the economic changes.
The social cohesion strategy involves actions aimed to attract social partners in the process
of elaboration and implementation of the policies, by permanently consulting the economic
operators and social dialogue partners, obtaining their support for implementing the structural
adjustments and insuring an efficient active social protection system.
One of the politics with a considerable influence over the industrial policy is that
encouraging research – development – innovation activities and infrastructure’s development in
order to evaluate the conformity of the industrial products. This factor is determinant in the efforts
of reducing the development gap between Romania and EU and one of the main factors in
increasing productivity and competitiveness.
An evaluation report (Policies in the fields of Research, Techonologic Development,
Innovation. Romania‟s RDI policies in the attention of the EU member states (II) – the final
evaluation report from the evaluators team from EU member states, 2005) from a delegation of
European experts concerning the research and development policies in Romania compared to
Lisbon Agenda underlined the challenges related to the insufficient human resources basis for
scientific and technologic research, the lack of adequate infrastructure, the insignificant connection
between industry and R&D activities and the absence of a functional institutional and legislative
frame. The same report underlined the necessity of identifying some main directions in the research
activity and the main development channels, of structural improvement and increased concern over
academic research.

capacity of defining and implementing coherent policy measures, finding the appropriate
mechanisms for projects’ identification, evaluating and granting the necessary funds, harmonizing
the legal, institutional and procedural frame according to the European regulations and stimulating
the modernization of the technical and informational infrastructure for research and development.
Sector assistance and regional policies are some other factors influencing the industrial
policy and one of the most sensitive fields. Sector policy is defined and implemented by the
Ministry of Economy and Commerce and concerns the encouragement of the strategic alliances
with technologic, industrial, economic and financial basis, the industrial clusters based on
international specialization and complementarities with the European countries, the development of
the internal market for industrial products, sector assistance for high added value products
benefiting from internal resources (IT, electro-technical industry, auto components, pharmaceutical
industry, furniture industry, technology and equipments for the food industry and forest industry).
The process of defining the sector policy must take into consideration the comparative
advantages of Romania from the time being and the possibility of developing new comparative
advantages in fields with a high added value. Romania detains comparative advantage in the labor
field, some exploitable natural resources with competitive costs as well as in the agricultural and
forest potential, in the existent industrial infrastructure and in the geographic position.
The regional policy priorities (Croitoru, Russu and Tarhoaca, 2002) concern the
improvement of the institutional frame at national and regional levels, improving the management
capacities of the institutions involved in the regional development products, increasing the
absorption capacity for structural funds and the correlation between the legislations regarding
industrial parks, disadvantaged regions, free areas and special regions.
Accomplishing the industrial policy objectives is directly related to the commercial policy
for exports encouragement without breaching the international agreements on free trade. The
specific measures (Industrial Policy of Romania 2005 – 2008, 2004, p. 10) concern the extensive
use of the facilities granted in the free trade arrangements and participating at the WTO negotiations
for free trade, identifying the niches in the international market for the enhancement of Romanian
exports, insuring the necessary support by extending the consultancy offer, offering training in the
international trade field and insuring guaranties against commercial and non-commercial risks.
Finally, another factor influencing the industrial policy objectives regards the environment
protection and the concern for sustainable development, according to the requirements of the
European Union in this field. The specific objectives (Industrial Policy of Romania 2005 – 2008,
2004, p. 11) in this direction concern the integration of the environment protection requirements and

the best available technologies and the “clean technologies”, rehabilitating the areas affected by
historic pollution and creating and developing a market for the services and technologies for waste
treatment and efficient use of energy.

monopolies, continuing the pricing liberalization and avoiding anti-competition practices and
economic concentrations.
One of the main factors acting in a decisive manner over the growth potential of industrial
competitiveness is a viable and friendly business environment. Insuring a stable business
environment, favoring a function market economy, is one of the obligations that Romania assumed

legislative and institutional frame, increasing the investment flow, reducing bureaucracy and
fighting corruption. However, Romania is still far from having a transparent, predictable and
attractive business environment.
Developing a stable business environment is an objective that assumes a series of measures
for increasing transparency and improving the Government – business environment – civil society
dialogue, estimating the regulations’ impact over the business climate, simplifying the
administrative procedures, implementing a coherent system to monitor the foreign direct
investments volume, implementing the corporate governance principles and strengthening the
involved institutions.
One of the policies with major impact over the industrial policy actions is that of Small and
Medium Enterprises encouragement, this sector having a special significance for the market
economy development. SME are characterized by an enhanced capacity of reaction faced to the
market stimuli and of adaptation to the economic structural changes. The Romanian authorities’
policy in this field, so far, lacked coherence, the supportive periods being followed by those of total
lapse.
A coherent strategy on the SME encouragement was adopted by the Government in 2001
only, through the “Action Plan to Eliminate Certain Barriers in front of Small and Medium
Enterprises”. The plan’s objectives aimed to simplify the registration and licensing procedures for
new SME, to improve the legal environment, to reduce and simplify the taxation system, to promote
the access to financing resources and public contracts and to supply an informational system for
SME.
The priorities (Industrial Policy of Romania 2005 – 2008, 2004, p. 8) for SME
encouragement concern the creation of a favorable business environment, the development of the
competitive capacities of SME, improving SME’s access to financing resources and to the external
markets and promoting the entrepreneurship and increasing management performances.
For implementing the SME encouragement measures the National Agency for Small and
Medium Enterprises and Cooperation was created (ANIMMC), acting as national coordinator for
implementing in Romania the European Book for Small Enterprises and the European multi-annual
program for enterprises and entrepreneurship, particularly for SME.
Another factor influencing the industrial policy concerned the privatization and
restructuration measures, which concerned completing the privatization processes for the stateowned companies, monitoring the privatization contracts, restructuring the activities for maximizing

competitive industrial units.
In connection with the industrial policy and that for improving the business environment is
the FDI promotion policy. Attracting foreign capital is possible by promoting Romania’s image as a
destination for foreign investors and assisting the foreign partners in the initial phases of FDI. The
Romanian Agency for FDI was created with the purpose of issuing the FDI promotion strategy and
an adequate legislation, and acting as a contact point for the new-coming and existing investors.
The development of education, human resources and social cohesion policies plays an
important role within the industrial policy efforts. The main measures concern encouraging workers
mobility, insuring a balance between the offer and demand of labor, developing the human
resources management and, finally, insuring specialized training by a tight cooperation between the
educational system and the business environment. The strategy for increasing the employment rate
concerns the human capital development, creating new working places, encouraging both workers
and companies’ adaptability to the economic changes.
The social cohesion strategy involves actions aimed to attract social partners in the process
of elaboration and implementation of the policies, by permanently consulting the economic
operators and social dialogue partners, obtaining their support for implementing the structural
adjustments and insuring an efficient active social protection system.
One of the politics with a considerable influence over the industrial policy is that
encouraging research – development – innovation activities and infrastructure’s development in
order to evaluate the conformity of the industrial products. This factor is determinant in the efforts
of reducing the development gap between Romania and EU and one of the main factors in
increasing productivity and competitiveness.
An evaluation report (Policies in the fields of Research, Techonologic Development,
Innovation. Romania‟s RDI policies in the attention of the EU member states (II) – the final
evaluation report from the evaluators team from EU member states, 2005) from a delegation of
European experts concerning the research and development policies in Romania compared to
Lisbon Agenda underlined the challenges related to the insufficient human resources basis for
scientific and technologic research, the lack of adequate infrastructure, the insignificant connection
between industry and R&D activities and the absence of a functional institutional and legislative
frame. The same report underlined the necessity of identifying some main directions in the research
activity and the main development channels, of structural improvement and increased concern over
academic research.

capacity of defining and implementing coherent policy measures, finding the appropriate
mechanisms for projects’ identification, evaluating and granting the necessary funds, harmonizing
the legal, institutional and procedural frame according to the European regulations and stimulating
the modernization of the technical and informational infrastructure for research and development.
Sector assistance and regional policies are some other factors influencing the industrial
policy and one of the most sensitive fields. Sector policy is defined and implemented by the
Ministry of Economy and Commerce and concerns the encouragement of the strategic alliances
with technologic, industrial, economic and financial basis, the industrial clusters based on
international specialization and complementarities with the European countries, the development of
the internal market for industrial products, sector assistance for high added value products
benefiting from internal resources (IT, electro-technical industry, auto components, pharmaceutical
industry, furniture industry, technology and equipments for the food industry and forest industry).
The process of defining the sector policy must take into consideration the comparative
advantages of Romania from the time being and the possibility of developing new comparative
advantages in fields with a high added value. Romania detains comparative advantage in the labor
field, some exploitable natural resources with competitive costs as well as in the agricultural and
forest potential, in the existent industrial infrastructure and in the geographic position.
The regional policy priorities (Croitoru, Russu and Tarhoaca, 2002) concern the
improvement of the institutional frame at national and regional levels, improving the management
capacities of the institutions involved in the regional development products, increasing the
absorption capacity for structural funds and the correlation between the legislations regarding
industrial parks, disadvantaged regions, free areas and special regions.
Accomplishing the industrial policy objectives is directly related to the commercial policy
for exports encouragement without breaching the international agreements on free trade. The
specific measures (Industrial Policy of Romania 2005 – 2008, 2004, p. 10) concern the extensive
use of the facilities granted in the free trade arrangements and participating at the WTO negotiations
for free trade, identifying the niches in the international market for the enhancement of Romanian
exports, insuring the necessary support by extending the consultancy offer, offering training in the
international trade field and insuring guaranties against commercial and non-commercial risks.
Finally, another factor influencing the industrial policy objectives regards the environment
protection and the concern for sustainable development, according to the requirements of the
European Union in this field. The specific objectives (Industrial Policy of Romania 2005 – 2008,
2004, p. 11) in this direction concern the integration of the environment protection requirements and

the best available technologies and the “clean technologies”, rehabilitating the areas affected by
historic pollution and creating and developing a market for the services and technologies for waste
treatment and efficient use of energy.

THE COMPATIBILITY OF ROMANIA’S INDUSTRIAL POLICY
WITH THAT OF THE EUROPEAN UNION
Petronela Nica
“Alexandru Ioan Cuza” University of Iaşi
Abstract: Romania‟s position as one of the EU member states brought new challenges in terms of
industrial policy, in order to respond to the necessity of bringing the competitiveness level of the Romanian
economy close to the average level of the European states, by respecting the free trade principles of the
European Union. Furthermore, in the near future Romania should be able to contribute to the achievement
of the objective of transforming EU in the most competitive economy of the world. In this order, a market –
oriented industrial policy is necessary, following the European industrial policy and the sustainable
development concepts adopted by the European Commission, and based on the concept of competitiveness.
The general purpose of a balanced economic growth, sustainable development and improvement of the
economic competitiveness requires industrial policies created and implemented in tight connection with
other relevant economic policies, such as the competition policies, those aiming for a functional business
environment and those encouraging the SME development and attracting FDE, the policies in the education
and research and development fields, the structural and regional policies, the commercial policies, the
sustainable development and environment protection policies and those regarding employment and social
cohesion.

For Romania, becoming a member of the European Union involved not only benefits and
opportunities, but also obligations related to the supplementary efforts required for economic
development and enhancement of the industrial production competitiveness in order to reach a level
comparable to the European average and contributing to the achievement of the European objective
as set in the Lisbon Agenda: transforming EU in the most competitive economy of the world.
In this order, a market – oriented industrial policy is necessary, following the European industrial
policy and the sustainable development concepts adopted by the European Commission, and based
on the concept of competitiveness. The European Union adopted a coherent attitude related to the

council, through a decision of the Council from Seville in June 2002.
In Romania, as consequence of the integration and adaptation of the economic policies to
those of the European Union in view of enhancing the economic performances at a national level,
the necessity of a coherent industrial policy became obvious. Therefore, in 2004, the document
titled “Industrial Policy of Romania 2005 – 2008” was issued, establishing the main directions for
action for the industrial policy for this period. The fundaments of the industrial policy were based
on encouraging the horizontal factors determining competitiveness: human capital, research,
innovation, entrepreneurship, preservation the environment.
The industrial policy objectives for the determined period were established in correlation
with the stipulations of other national economic policies and with the European guidelines. The
main objectives of the Romanian industrial policy were defined as followig (Croitoru, Russu and
Tarhoaca, 2002, p. 2):
-

Enhancing competitiveness;

-

Increasing the role of research, development and innovation;

-

Promoting a sustainable management of natural resources and environment
protection;

-

Improving professional training and employment;

-

Developing the cooperation and industrial services as well as the public – private
partnership.

In the same time, the industrial policy priorities on medium term were defined (Croitoru,
Russu and Tarhoaca, 2002): applying the industrial policy according to the specific necessities of
each sector, improving the legislative frame favoring industry as well as the synergy of the different
policies with direct impact on industrial competitiveness.
The same document established the economic policies’ program for the period of time taken
into consideration, which assumed the legislative adaptation and creation of the institutions
compatible with those of the EU, implementing and monitoring the harmonized legislation,
improving the business environment, diversifying and modernizing the bank services, reducing
taxation related to labor costs, moving forward to the informational society, adopting a coherent
package of policies aiming to continue structural adjustments and improve competitiveness,
creating an integrated system for controlling the industrial pollution, starting the main infrastructure
projects and adapting the research and development system to the European operational structures.
The structural adjustments taken into consideration concerned the development of the
industrial sectors insuring high added values, the development of industrial clusters, technologic

structure of the companies as well as that of the management, environment rehabilitation, the
stimulation of the cooperation between the local companies, increasing the role of innovation and
technological research and starting some programs for producing and utilizing energy from
renewable resources.
The general purpose of a balanced economic growth, sustainable development and
improvement of the economic competitiveness requires industrial policies created and implemented
in tight connection with other relevant economic policies, such as the competition policies, those
aiming for a functional business environment and those encouraging the SME development and
attracting FDE, the policies in the education and research and development fields, the structural and
regional policies, the commercial policies, the sustainable development and environment protection
policies and those regarding employment and social cohesion.
The competition policy “concerns those instruments that insure the market’s fundaments and
facilitate the development of efficient and competitive companies”(Negrescu and Oprescu, 2004, p.
4). Succeeding in such policies is one of the main factors of a functional market economy and a
strong internal market. The competition policy must take into consideration the regulations
concerning the incentives granted by the state in conformity with the European Acquis, as well as
the provisions of the Law of Competition no. 21/1996 and the secondary legislation, following the
European guidelines and must insure the necessary support for the Competition Council.
The competition policy objectives (Croitoru, Russu and Tarhoaca, 2002) concern the
following aspects:
-

strengthening the authority of the Competition Council and that of the Competition
Office, in the purpose of increasing the capacity of these organisms to issue and
implement the specific regulations;

-

improving the legislation concerning the state incentives, according to the
European Acquis;

-

revising the legislation regarding the industrial parks, in conformity with the
competition regulations.

The actions meant to encourage competition concern the limitation of the action area of the
monopolies, continuing the pricing liberalization and avoiding anti-competition practices and
economic concentrations.
