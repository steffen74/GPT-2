signiﬁcant improvement in health. Today the region is well advanced in its
demographic and epidemiological transition: Latin American countries have
undergone profound demographic changes, which are variously reﬂected in the
decrease in population growth and in population ageing. Furthermore, health
problems are now highly concentrated on noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), and
there is little doubt that their levels will substantially increase in the near future.
Taking into account the stages where the region is in terms of its transitions, the
health policy frontier must include (1) public health policies that reduce risk factors
that cause NCDs by promoting healthy behaviors; and (2) health insurance
programs that offer households effective access to quality health care at reasonable
costs. Since these two issues are the region’s main health policy priorities, much of
this paper is devoted to analyzing how public health interventions can encourage
changes toward healthier behaviors, and how policymakers can expand access to
health insurance programs in a context of high labor informality.
In terms of behavior, interventions that create environments conducive to making
healthy choices might not be effective if there are biases that lead individuals to take
suboptimal decisions—a phenomenon that should not be ignored by policymakers.
The authors explore this issue by developing a theoretical model of household
decision-making that assesses how lack of knowledge and self-control problems
affect individual behavior related to food consumption, which later leads to weight
problems and obesity. Behavior plays an important role in several NCDs, although
each disease should be analyzed separately. The theoretical model provides a crucial
conclusion: knowledge gaps affect the rational choice of individuals. Robust
evidence on policy interventions that address these biases is rather limited. Looking
across the spectrum of health behaviors the authors show that programs involving
counseling together with behavioral interventions seem to be the most effective in
improving weight-related behaviors or outcomes.
In terms of access and insurance, policymakers must deal with the paradox of
trying to expand access to health care in a context of high labor informality. Since
health insurance in Latin America is mostly provided within the labor market,
effective access to health care services is restricted to workers in the formal sector.
This excludes informal sector workers who make up approximately 50 percent of
the region’s labor force. Following Galiani and Weinschelbaum (2012), the authors
present a theoretical framework that assesses the relationship between health
insurance and the labor market ﬁnding that workers with low levels of human
capital generally work in the informal sector, and that an expansion of health
insurance coverage will increase the size of the formal sector as well as the wages of
informal sector workers.
Given the current stage of Latin America’s demographic and epidemiologic
transition and the signiﬁcant share of NCDs in the region’s morbidity and mortality
patterns, the suggested areas for future research are (1) how to expand and make
health care accessible and affordable for individuals in a context of high labor
informality, and (2) how to develop effective interventions that inﬂuence
individuals toward healthy behaviors in the face of time inconsistency and
educational quantity and quality in Latin America and looks at priorities for
research. The paper shows that in terms of quantity—deﬁned as how much contact
individuals have with the school system—educational systems in Latin America are
not underperformers. Moreover, in absolute terms, measures of educational quantity
have been improving over time. Nevertheless, four challenges remain: (1)
expanding preprimary enrollment; (2) reducing delayed entry among 6- and
7-year-olds; (3) raising rural enrollment in the 8–13-year-old age range; and (4)
reducing dropout rates in the 14–17-year-old age range.
In contrast, educational quality—deﬁned as the skills individuals gain from
contact with school system—is low in the region. This is reﬂected in terms of
absolute performance on national and regional tests, as well as relative performance
on international tests—even adjusting for per capita income. As a result, this paper
is focused on the quality of Latin American education.
The author reviews the progress economists have made toward devising
evidence-based educational policy, and highlights several remaining challenges in
the region. In keeping with this article, the discussion at times emphasizes Latin
America, although the evidence comes from, and the conclusions are meant to apply
to, countries in other regions and with diverse income levels.
The ﬁrst challenge involves expanding research on the casual effects of school
inputs. Making progress in this area requires dealing with three main obstacles: (1)
data availability, as there are few available standardized measures of skill; (2)
methodological issues that involve ascertaining the causal effects of each input; and
(3) availability of cost information, that is, data that render cost-effectiveness
comparisons feasible.
The second challenge involves producing a full-scale road map for an evidencebased education policy. Speciﬁcally, the focus of this work has been on generating a
ranking of inputs and interventions in terms of cost-effectiveness, with the rationale
that such ranking will one day guide policy throughout the developing world.
There has been less work on the effects of educational inputs during the
preschool stage. Therefore, further work on the impact of preschool inputs
represents a third challenge. In contrast, there has been progress on understanding
the effects of incentives within education. For example, there is signiﬁcant work on
the effects of introducing competition in school systems. However, in general, the
effects of voucher and analogous initiatives have not been nearly as robust or
positive as most economists expected. As a result, further progress is needed in
understanding how to improve the design of policies introducing competition.
Finally, the author argues that there is relatively less work surrounding the effects
of inputs provided by parents and students, both in terms of resources and effort.
The key issue here is to what extent parental and student effort matter, and how their
level of effort responds to incentives. For example, returns to skills in the labor
market, or in admission to universities, may be crucial in determining the attitudes
of parents and students toward skill accumulation. Furthermore, understanding these
incentives may be essential not only to school system design but also to correctly
transport infrastructure in Latin America and the Caribbean and examines the effect
of past interventions aimed at improving the living standards of the urban poor.
In recent decades, the global urbanization trend has been driven by the
developing world. Latin America, however, is an outlier among the developing
regions because of its strikingly high urbanization rate. And as cities in the region
were not prepared for such rapid and unplanned urbanization, the expected beneﬁts
of urbanization did not materialize for many migrants, resulting in the ‘‘urbanization
of poverty.’’
Regarding access to formal housing, Latin American ownership rates are higher
on average than in other developing regions, although large disparities remain
between countries and income groups. The rental sector for low-income residents in
the region is undeveloped, and most slum dwellers do not have secure property
rights. Regarding transport systems, overall mobility—as measured by the number
of daily trips per person—ranks low in the region in comparison with countries in
the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. A salient pattern is
the exponential growth of motorization in the region. Latin America does not rank
high in road infrastructure, which exacerbates the problems of pollution and
congestion brought about by excessive motorization. Another problem with motororiented transportation in the region is that not everyone can afford to buy a car.
Thus, the poor rely basically on mass public transit, which has low coverage and,
although subsidized, is very expensive for those with low incomes.
Improving access to formal housing and upgrading mass public transit are the
two main priorities to prevent the formation of new slum areas and attenuate the
growth of existing irregular settlements. In relation to the ﬁrst priority of access to
formal housing, the authors ﬁnd that there are supply constraints, such as scant
availability of units for the low-income population segment, and demand constraints
such as insufﬁcient income to afford private sector dwellings and the inability to
document income. In relation to the second priority related to mass public transit,
the author notes that while incentive-based measures such as congestion pricing are
successful in reducing congestion and pollution in the developed world, there are
technological barriers to the implementation of such systems in Latin America.
Improving the quality of life in informal settlements is another policy priority.
Since the 1980s, ‘‘in situ’’ slum upgrading has become popular based on the notion
that it is both socially and economically more desirable. However, it seems that
integral slum upgrading programs are necessary to produce more profound and
long-lasting changes to improve the living standards of the urban poor.
The ﬁrst suggested area for future research is on ways to make mass public transit
accessible and affordable for the poor, and on how this can in turn affect
consumption of housing services and shape a city’s spatial patterns. Policies that
integrate transport reforms with the supply of housing for low-income households
seem the most promising to prevent the formation of new slum areas. In terms of
access to formal housing, there is scant knowledge on the best way to expand the
housing supply for the poor or promote the rental market for low-income
households, which to date has been neglected. As for land titling to formalize the
determine the most effective and efﬁcient way to undertake such initiatives.
Finally, in the last article of this issue, Brian Feld and Sebastian Galiani describe
projected trends in climate change for Latin America and the consequence these
changes could have in the region. Research and policy on climate change in the
region are still in the early stages, hence this article is mostly devoted to providing
some insight into which steps should be taken ﬁrst, where research efforts should be
directed, and how policy measures should be evaluated before being carried out.
The authors develop a theoretical framework that draws partly on previous
literature and reach three main conclusions for the region. First, the ﬁnancing for
mitigation—deﬁned as the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions—depends mostly
on foreign transfers. Mitigation is a global public good, thus its beneﬁts are not fully
internalized by the country that bears its cost. In turn, the beneﬁts of mitigation
expenditure are related to whether it can signiﬁcantly reduce the stock of emissions.
It is expected that this effect will be marginal in environmentally small economies
relative to the emissions generated by large economies (Chisari et al. 2013). Second,
public spending on adaptation—which refers to all measures taken to increase
resilience and reduce damage produced by climate change—will be positive even
for environmentally small economies. Unlike mitigation, adaptation does not always
entail an international positive externality, so countries that engage in this type of
policies can secure their beneﬁts for themselves. Third, investment in public goods
that are useful even in the absence of climate change will be positive irrespective of
the size of the economy.
Although these conclusions allow inferring the type of strategies worth
considering under different contexts, the question of which policies Latin American
countries should pursue to address climate change is still unclear. To elucidate this,
the authors describe the steps that should be followed, and note the importance of
policymakers carrying out cost–beneﬁt analysis of policies under consideration to
determine which ones are worth implementing. Based on both cost-beneﬁt
considerations and the theoretical framework, the article argues that Latin America
should focus mainly in adaptation to cope with climate change consequences, and in
carrying out traditional development policies that will increase resilience but will
also be welfare-improving in the absence of climate change.
Notwithstanding that there is still little evidence on how climate change will
affect economic systems and which sectors should be given priority when
considering adaptation policies, the article argues that the agricultural and livestock
sector, in particular, might well be an area of priority.
Finally, the article deals with the question of what to do if the proper
international incentives are put in place to encourage mitigation in environmentally
small economies such as those in Latin America. Recent research points to the
comparative advantage Latin America might have in conserving and managing its
vast forest areas so that the region can act as a huge carbon sink (Chisari and
Galiani 2010).

This special issue was made possible, thanks to funding from the Ofﬁce of Strategic
Planning and Development Effectiveness (SPD) of the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB). The issue was conceived by Sebastian Martinez (SPD) and by
Sebastian Galiani, of the University of Maryland, who wrote the introduction and
contributed to several of the articles. The coordinators acknowledge the support of
Carola Alvarez (IDB) and Arturo Galindo (SPD) in the preparation of the papers,
and they thank Paloma Acevedo (SPD) for overseeing the editing and production
process.
Over the past 10 years, the IDB has supported efforts by the research and policy
community to undertake rigorous evaluations of programs and policies throughout
the region. The purpose of the articles included in this issue is to take stock of
certain areas—health, education, housing and infrastructure, and climate change—
and propose the next frontier of research to support enactment of more effective
policies going forward that take into account the region’s economic and social
priorities. Needless to say, the topics covered in this issue are not exhaustive, and
work is already under way on a new set of topics—including poverty, crime,
pensions, and labor markets—that we expect to publish in 2017.
In the ﬁrst article of this issue, Maria Victoria Anauati, Sebastian Galiani, and
Federico Weinschelbaum deﬁne a health policy frontier, which is understood as the
primary interventions according to the current health priorities of Latin America.
The paper analyzes the region’s ongoing epidemiological and demographic
transitions and addresses the challenges faced by policymakers. Over the past two
