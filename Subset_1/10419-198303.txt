INTRODUCTION

In the last century, a change with enormous implications appeared on the list of human
priorities: instead of happiness, the first place was taken by the problem of survival (Giurgiu, n.d.).
We all know that any human activity can have positive or negative effects on the environment.
The geo-system includes several subsystems interacting with each other, with a continuous
exchange of energy and matter among them. The anthroposphere presents different interactions with
the biosphere, and it can modify it by its actions (Avramescu, 2005). The irrational environmental
exploitation for economic or social welfare reasons, which represent the main purpose of intensive
economic development, characteristic of our century, cannot be maintained on long term unless the
environment becomes completely degraded, involving risks even for the survival of human species
he also tried to explain the difference between growth and development, rejecting the concept that
the ecologists were against economic development and human society.
Daly and Cobb (1989), considered the founders of the theory of sustainable development,
elaborated between 1971 and 1981 the concept of steady state economics, which is the basis on
which the notion of sustainable economy was later consolidated. Starting with this concept of
steady state economics, the concept of sustainable development was initiated ten years later.
In 1990, the World Bank was organising in Washington an International Interdisciplinary
Conference with the subject Ecological Economics of Sustainability, when The International
Society for Ecological Economics was founded. This became a reunion of several specialists from
the entire world.
In 1992, in Rio de Janeiro, from June3rd to June 14th, the United Nations Conference on
Environment and Development took place, attended by 178 states, which was later followed by a
two-day summit, called EARTH SUMMIT (World Conference Environment and development in
Rio de Janeiro, 1992). This conference constituted the beginning of the endeavours concerning
environmental issues and sustainable development (Casey J. Dawkins, 2003). The participants in
the Summit, leaders of the states of the world, adopted there the following main documents: the Rio
Declaration; the Convention on Climate Change; the Convention on Biodiversity; the Declaration
on Desertification; Agenda 21. (Giurgiu, n.d.)
Since Romania is member of the European Union, the concept of sustainable development
should also have an impact on the territory of our country. Nowadays, not only that the concept of
sustainable development is of great interest, but it also has a long perspective. Sustainable
development, among several other roles, also contributes to change the life style, and it makes us, in
a certain way, become better and more tolerant.

1. SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT – CONCEPTUAL APPROACH

Taking into account the concept of sustainable development, we can state that this mainly
refers to the problem of resources. All the evidence shows a real concern for our planet and the
natural resources, which are limited quantitatively. Also, our environment is more and more
polluted, and the population of the planet is continuously growing, which does not limit the main
problem of sustainability only to strictly economic aspects. On the contrary, efforts are made to
optimally combine the economic aspects (concerning the resources) with the social ones
protection and pollution reduction).
A sustainable development should allow human life to continue, and it should also assure
environmental protection from the activities of the society. Some natural disasters appeared not only
as a result of high risk activities, but also due to the way we behaved with the place where we
developed our daily activities (Ţugulea, et al., 2013). The greenhouse effect, acid rain,
desertification, ozone holes, pollution, destruction of forests and of biodiversity, erosion are
indicated as evidence that an economic development with no limits is a way with no return, which
can lead no more to economic welfare; the natural capital and the patrimony left by our ancestors
should persuade us to reinitiate a truly sustainable economy.
According to Tiezzi and Marchettini (1998), the new theories of sustainable development and
ecological economy confront us with a paradigm: today there is no economy based on two
parameters (capital and work), but an ecological economy which admits the existence of three
parameters: work, natural capital, and capital produced by man. Consequently, we consider that
sustainable development also represents a problem of relationships and interdependence. Carrying
capacity is the capacity of the planet to support the population and other life forms, flora and fauna,
which man and nature need in order to survive. This is the basis of sustainability.
Over the time, it is obvious that from a rich world concerning the natural capital and a poor
world concerning the capital produced by man, we passed to a very poor world from a natural point
of view, and rich in what concerns the capital produced by man. (Ţugulea et al., 2014)
Consequently, Rudolf (1985), the founder of thermodynamics, stated: In a nation’s economy, there
is a generally available law: the consumption should never be higher than what can be produced in
the same period of time. This is why we should consume no more fuel than it can be possibly
reproduced by tree growth.
A very clear definition was given within the World Commission on Environment and
Development attached to United Nations Organization, also known as Brundtland Commission or
Brundtland Report (from Gro Harlem Brundtland‟s name, who was then the Prime Minister of
Norway): sustainable development represents a development satisfying the present needs without
compromising the capacity of future generations to satisfy their own (Ardelean and Maior, 2000).
Other definitions attributed to sustainable development are as follows: sustainable
development is the economic development of mankind which completely takes into account the
ecological consequences of the economic activity, and it is based on the resources that can be
replaced or regenerated and therefore cannot be exhausted (Berca, 1998-2001); sustainable
development is nothing but a vector of the desired social objectives, obviously the ones related to
p.28); sustainability can be expressed with the help of a system of indicators. It is fundamental that
a sustainable development is based on the following three value judgements: equal rights with
future generations, leaving the inheritance of an intact nature, and an international justice (Pitea,
1999).
In the concept of sustainable development there are three main axes, as follows: sustainable
environment, social equity and economic prosperity. Most of the times, people think only about
themselves, they are too selfish to think of the future, of the future generations, and they have norms
like: having a decent and comfortable living; economic prosperity; to relax in a nice landscape, at
least in leisure time; to have access to health and education systems; to have a series of basic rights
respected; to have the perspective of a decent pension.
From these norms, we can clearly see that very few are those who are concerned about nature,
about what surrounds them, and about the fact that one should be responsible for the society and for
the environment, eliminating the indifference and demonstrating that by involving personally one
can obtain positive effects on the environment and society.
In conclusion, as a general imagine of the future society, sustainable consumption will
become a complex field, situated at the crossroads of several subjects. We should all participate in
the action of supporting a sustainable environment, because society is an immense consumer with
mechanisms directed only towards economic development, using the sustainability of natural environment
in order to develop.

2. LASTING DEVELOPMENT vs SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT

Sustainable development can be generally defined as the improvement of each person’s life
now and for the generations to come.
The concept of sustainable development promoted by United Nations forums mainly refers to:


Equitable and balanced economic development;



Higher level of employment, social cohesion and inclusion;



Assuming responsibility for the use of natural resources and of environmental protection;



Coherent, open and transparent policies;



International cooperation for global promotion of sustainable development.
Georgescu (1995) considers that the economic and social development, the state of the

environment and human health are strongly connected, conditioning one another, environment and
health constituting conditions necessary for any process of development, which can influence at its
is generally accepted that the terms lasting and sustainable can conceptually substitute one another,
we consider that we should accept a few distinctions which could prove important, including the
methodological point of view. In this context, the expressions “lasting development” or lasting
growth are quasi-correct, because both development and growth are processes necessarily
associated to social institutions (in their most general meaning), so they bear the impact generated
by the non-natural action agent.
Development or growth can only be sustainable, not lasting. Taking into account the
specialists‟ opinion, (Ţugulea, Bobâlcă and Soponaru, 2013) we can speak of lasting development
or of lasting growth only metaphorically, or by abuse of language. From a rigorous point of view,
the terms should be referred as sustainable development or sustainable growth.
The acceptance of the concept of lasting development by the Romanian authors (Cămășoiu,
1994, p.24) led to a series of semantic or pragmatic difficulties.
The concept of lasting / sustainable is considered by Bănacu (2004) a debatable topic, due to
an erroneous understanding of the semantics of the words mentioned. Consequently, he gives further
explanations with the intention to justify his preference for the use of the expression sustainable
development:
the expression sustainable development is taken from Anglo-Saxon literature. The term
sustainable originates from Latin, the verb sustenare meaning to sustain, to support and also to selfsupport.
the term sustainability has the same meaning in other Latin languages, like Spanish
(sustenabilidade), Italian (sustenabilita) or Portuguese (sustentavel). It means a state of continuous
balance due not only to the capacity of a system to be consumer of (primary) resources, but also to
its capacity to create its own resources, to follow a regenerative cycle.
according to Merriam Webster Dictionary, a lasting system is a system existing or continuing
for a long time. This does not necessarily mean that it would be in harmony with nature (which is
required by the principles of sustainability), neither that it would have the possibility to create its
own resources (to self-support). For example, a rock is lasting in time, and a tree or any living
organism is sustainable, because it has the capacity to sustain, to support itself – to integrate in a
natural cycle.
the term sustainability cannot be considered a neologism in Romanian (perhaps only
partially), due to its Latin origin (the verb sustenare) with corresponding Romanian words (a sustine
– to sustain/support, a se sustine, a se intretine - to support itself).
by the presence or absence of dissipative systems in the process or system analysed. From this point
of view, it is considered that the reference to durability (lasting systems) as a dynamic characteristic
of processes or systems, excludes the natural environment where there are no dissipative systems;
in any natural environment where there are dissipative (human or non-human) systems, we cannot
speak of durability anymore, only of sustainability.
The concept of lasting has the significance of persistence in time of a structure or entity, while
the concept of sustainable has rather the meaning of the possibility to maintain in time that entity or
structure, in an attractive way (Jugănaru, 2007, p.247).
In such an approach, we may consider a rock as being lasting if it has no intervention upon it,
but a public institution can prove to be sustainable. From this perspective, we can make a semantic
distinction between the two concepts, considering the aspect of their connection with the action
agent.
On the other hand, while durability denotes only the aspect of being stationary, sustainability
may also refer to a dose of growth or ungrowth. In other words, there might be a sustainable
development or an unsustainable development, or a sustainable growth or an unsustainable growth,
as well as a sustainable ungrowth or an unsustainable ungrowth (Theobald, 1998).
In such an approach, we consider it is correct to use the terms sustainable development or
sustainable growth.

4. MODEL OF SUSTAINABLE TOURISM DEVELOPMENT

According to Vellas, sustainable tourism development belongs to the process of planning the
activities whose purpose is to avoid any actions affecting the very bases of development, as follows:
ecosystems degradation, endangering the cultural patrimony, brutal modification of traditions and
people‟s life style, as well as competition for the access to equipment and infrastructure. (Vellas,
2002, p.190)
Consequently, sustainable tourism development is related to anadequate environmental
management. There are several ways by which it may be assured. A model of sustainable tourism
development is presented in Figure 1 (Buckley, 1996).
This model of tourism development should be applied in all the regions of great tourist
attraction.
Starting with this model, we consider that sustainable tourism development should be
approached from the very stages of design and construction of tourist equipment in order to avoid
continued to the stage of tourism activity development, when the effects over the environment could
be controlled through the authorised organisms, and when strategies could be established to resolve
the deficiencies, to adequately equip ecologically the tourist endowment.

cooperation among authorities (who possess the legislative, economic, social instruments, other
regulatory documents of public interest), economic agents (who initiate projects of improvement
and tourist services), defenders of the environmental protection and cultural patrimony, local
providers of tourist services, tour-operators and tourism agents, and last but not least, tourists - as
beneficiaries.
In practice, we have come to the conclusion that there were two separate coordinates
applicable in tourism in what concerned sustainability (Ștefănică, 2010). The first and the most
important coordinate on long term consists of improving sustainable practices at the destinations
chosen by tourists, where they can have a negative impact over the natural environment (for
example, the erosion of coral reefs by recreation activities, or of mountains by skiing and hiking,
excessive use of fresh water for bathing, swimming, watering the gardens, the golf courses, water
pollution by dumping untreated waste in rivers, and carbon dioxide emissions by the use of
automobiles), as well as over the socio-cultural environment (for example, the transformation of art
and traditional customs in a form of animation and profit for the hotels, imposing behavioural and
cultural norms of abundance, characteristic especially to Western societies, to the cultures who are
not familiar with such methods, by a process often called neo-colonialism).
However, in contrast with other industries, comparable as dimension and relevance, tourism
industry has the potential to contribute positively and in a great measure to the welfare of the
destinations visited. The opportunity to exploit these positive, sustainable contributions is making
tourism such a vital preoccupation for the 21st century.
The second coordinate refers to the modality in which the companies from tourism industry
make their operation and development decisions. Some activities take place at the destination, for
example at the hotels, B&Bs, inns, resort villages, different forms of attractions, others take place
away from destinations, for example airlines, tourism agencies or tour-operators‟ activity. Tourism
companies have as many reasons to control the pollution and to administer waste as any other
company from other industry. They even bear a greater responsibility, taking into account that they
often operate in highly attractive areas, but also very sensitive from an environmental point of view.
This becomes a problem for the design of a hotel building, or for the development of the
surrounding area. A good design of buildings and green areas can reduce very much the level of
pollution produced by a given number of tourists per day. Furthermore, it is necessary to implement
programmes for saving the energy, for the control of sound pollution and emissions, for reduction of
fresh water consumption, for lower use of toxic chemical substances, for recycling and reuse of
materials.

Sustainable tourism has the potential to promote social development by the creation of new
workplaces, redistribution of income and decrease of poverty. (Ștefănică, 2010) From an economic
point of view, the main advantages of sustainable tourism are related to foreign currency gains,
contributions to Governmental income, generation of opportunities concerning occupation of labour
and of business. Table 1 presents synthetic advantages generated by the practice of sustainable
tourism.

Under asocial aspect, the advantages determined by the practice of sustainable tourism are
presented as follows:
 Tourism represents a force for maintaining the peace. By travelling, people have contact with
one another. Due to the fact that sustainable tourism has an educational component, it can
cultivate the understanding among people and cultures and it offers the possibility of cultural
exchanges between hosts and visitors. This leads to the increase of people‟s chances to develop
sympathies and reciprocal understanding, and to reduce prejudices.
 Strengthening the communities. Sustainable tourism can bring vitality to the communities in
many ways. An example would be the events and festivals where the locals are the main
participants, but also spectators. These events are often refreshed and organised as a result of the
interest manifested by tourists. At the same time, the workplaces created in tourism can act as an
important motivating factor in reducing the migration from rural areas. The locals can also have
and of the perspectives in what concerns the income obtained from their professional training in
the field of tourism, business development and their organisational abilities.
 Development of facilities as a benefit for the local community. In the places where tourism
industry supports the creation of facilities and services useful to the community, which
otherwise could not be developed, it can lead to reach high standards of prosperity in some
regions. These benefits can include a better infrastructure, the improvement of health system and
of transportation network, new recreational and sports facilities, restaurants and public areas, as
well as an influx of high quality food and consumption goods.
 Revitalisation of culture and traditions. Sustainable tourism has the potential to improve the
conservation and transmission of cultural and historical traditions. Contributing to the
sustainable conservation and management of natural resources, it can generally lead to the
possibility of protecting the local cultural patrimony or to the revitalisation of local cultures by
regenerating cultural arts and crafts.
 Tourism encouraging civic implication and the sense of pride. In some cases, sustainable
tourism contributes to the raise of the level of local conscientiousness concerning the financial
value of natural and cultural places. This could stimulate the sense of pride in what concerns the
local and national patrimony and develop the interest for its conservation. Consequently, the
implication of local communities in sustainable tourism development and operation seems to be
an important condition in what concerns the sustainable use and conservation of biodiversity.
 Benefits of sustainable tourism for tourists. There are many benefits for tourists: they can enjoy
the undegraded beauty of the natural environment and of the landscapes, the quality of the
environment (clean air and waters), a healthy community with low rates of criminality, the
authenticity of flourishing local traditions and culture (Ştefănică and Butnaru, 2013).
We present as follows the main economic advantages and benefits which sustainable tourism
can enhance:
 Income realised from the exchange of foreign currency. The money spent by tourists, the import
and export of goods and services generates an income for the host economy. Tourism represents
an important source in what concerns the income of foreign currency for at least 38% of the
countries. (UNWTO, n.d.)
 Contributions to the governmental income. The income realised by the government due to this
sector of tourism can be classified as direct and indirect income. The direct income is generated
by the taxes on the tourism employees‟ income, by commercial activities related to tourism, and
by the fees applied directly to tourists, like the ecological fees, or the output taxes. The indirect
tourists, for example the taxes on the souvenirs, alcohol, restaurants.
 Generation of work places. The quick expansion of tourism led to the creation of a considerable
number of work places. Tourism can generate work places directly by hotels, restaurants, taxis,
souvenir sale, and indirectly by providing goods and services which are necessary commercial
activities with in this sector (Dumitrică, 2012). According to World Tourism Organisation,
tourism represents approximately 7% of the total number of employees at a global level.
 Stimulation of investments in infrastructure. Tourism can determine the local authorities to
improve the infrastructure by creating better systems of water supply and sewage, roads,
electrical energy supply systems, telephony and public transportation networks. All these
contribute to the improvement of local residents‟ quality of life, and to the facilitation of
tourism.
 Contribution to the development of local economy. Tourism can constitute an important or even
essential part of local economy (Butnaru and Timu, 2011). Due to the fact that the environment
represents one of the basic components of the values of tourism industry, the income realised by
this sector is often used as a measure of the economic value of the protected areas. There is also
another local income which cannot be easily quantified, because not all the tourists‟ expenses
are registered officially in macroeconomic statistics. Part of the income from tourism is realised
freely, like that of street vendors or unofficial guides. The positive side of these activities which
develop freely or are not registered in statistics is that the money obtained is returned to the local
economy and has a substantial multiplicative effect, because it is introduced cyclically into the
circuit. World Tourism Organisation and Tourism Council estimate that tourism generates an
indirect contribution equal to the direct encashment from this sector.
 Direct financial contributions concerning nature protection. Tourism can contribute directly to
the conservation of the sensitive areas and habitats. The income realised by park entrance fees or
other similar sources can be al located especially for financing the protection and management
of the environmentally sensitive areas. Some governmental authorities collect these sums of
money by different exhaustive and indirect ways which are not particularly related to parks or
protected areas (Ştefănică and Butnaru, 2013). Consequently, the taxes of use, income taxes,
taxes on sale or rental of recreation equipment, and licensing fees for activities like fishing or
hunting can provide governments with the funds necessary for the administration of natural
resources.
 The advantage offered by competition. More and more tour-operators admit an active approach
concerning sustainability, not only because tourists expect them to act accordingly, but also
survival of this industry on long term. More and more tour-operators prefer to work with the
providers acting in a sustainable manner, for example saving water and energy, observing local
culture and helping the host community.
CONCLUSIONS
Due to the attention and support that sustainable development received in general, and
particularly in tourism, is still a subject of intense debate, with no consensus in what concerns its
definition and practical applicability. No matter the opinions of several researchers and analysts,
sustainable development of tourism represents the dominant approach regarding the administration
of the relationship between tourism and environment, based on a group of principles and objectives
which had been adopted almost unanimously, with the purpose to minimise the negative impact of
tourism over the environment.
In conclusion, we consider that, both theoretically and practically, sustainable tourism should
aim, on the one hand, to integrally capitalise exceptional natural and cultural resources, to improve
the quality of life in local communities, and on the other hand, to satisfy tourists‟ motivations and
requirements in close connection with environmental conservation and protection for the future
generations.

INTRODUCTION

In the last century, a change with enormous implications appeared on the list of human
priorities: instead of happiness, the first place was taken by the problem of survival (Giurgiu, n.d.).
We all know that any human activity can have positive or negative effects on the environment.
The geo-system includes several subsystems interacting with each other, with a continuous
exchange of energy and matter among them. The anthroposphere presents different interactions with
the biosphere, and it can modify it by its actions (Avramescu, 2005). The irrational environmental
exploitation for economic or social welfare reasons, which represent the main purpose of intensive
economic development, characteristic of our century, cannot be maintained on long term unless the
environment becomes completely degraded, involving risks even for the survival of human species
he also tried to explain the difference between growth and development, rejecting the concept that
the ecologists were against economic development and human society.
Daly and Cobb (1989), considered the founders of the theory of sustainable development,
elaborated between 1971 and 1981 the concept of steady state economics, which is the basis on
which the notion of sustainable economy was later consolidated. Starting with this concept of
steady state economics, the concept of sustainable development was initiated ten years later.
In 1990, the World Bank was organising in Washington an International Interdisciplinary
Conference with the subject Ecological Economics of Sustainability, when The International
Society for Ecological Economics was founded. This became a reunion of several specialists from
the entire world.
In 1992, in Rio de Janeiro, from June3rd to June 14th, the United Nations Conference on
Environment and Development took place, attended by 178 states, which was later followed by a
two-day summit, called EARTH SUMMIT (World Conference Environment and development in
Rio de Janeiro, 1992). This conference constituted the beginning of the endeavours concerning
environmental issues and sustainable development (Casey J. Dawkins, 2003). The participants in
the Summit, leaders of the states of the world, adopted there the following main documents: the Rio
Declaration; the Convention on Climate Change; the Convention on Biodiversity; the Declaration
on Desertification; Agenda 21. (Giurgiu, n.d.)
Since Romania is member of the European Union, the concept of sustainable development
should also have an impact on the territory of our country. Nowadays, not only that the concept of
sustainable development is of great interest, but it also has a long perspective. Sustainable
development, among several other roles, also contributes to change the life style, and it makes us, in
a certain way, become better and more tolerant.

1. SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT – CONCEPTUAL APPROACH

Taking into account the concept of sustainable development, we can state that this mainly
refers to the problem of resources. All the evidence shows a real concern for our planet and the
natural resources, which are limited quantitatively. Also, our environment is more and more
polluted, and the population of the planet is continuously growing, which does not limit the main
problem of sustainability only to strictly economic aspects. On the contrary, efforts are made to
optimally combine the economic aspects (concerning the resources) with the social ones
protection and pollution reduction).
A sustainable development should allow human life to continue, and it should also assure
environmental protection from the activities of the society. Some natural disasters appeared not only
as a result of high risk activities, but also due to the way we behaved with the place where we
developed our daily activities (Ţugulea, et al., 2013). The greenhouse effect, acid rain,
desertification, ozone holes, pollution, destruction of forests and of biodiversity, erosion are
indicated as evidence that an economic development with no limits is a way with no return, which
can lead no more to economic welfare; the natural capital and the patrimony left by our ancestors
should persuade us to reinitiate a truly sustainable economy.
According to Tiezzi and Marchettini (1998), the new theories of sustainable development and
ecological economy confront us with a paradigm: today there is no economy based on two
parameters (capital and work), but an ecological economy which admits the existence of three
parameters: work, natural capital, and capital produced by man. Consequently, we consider that
sustainable development also represents a problem of relationships and interdependence. Carrying
capacity is the capacity of the planet to support the population and other life forms, flora and fauna,
which man and nature need in order to survive. This is the basis of sustainability.
Over the time, it is obvious that from a rich world concerning the natural capital and a poor
world concerning the capital produced by man, we passed to a very poor world from a natural point
of view, and rich in what concerns the capital produced by man. (Ţugulea et al., 2014)
Consequently, Rudolf (1985), the founder of thermodynamics, stated: In a nation’s economy, there
is a generally available law: the consumption should never be higher than what can be produced in
the same period of time. This is why we should consume no more fuel than it can be possibly
reproduced by tree growth.
A very clear definition was given within the World Commission on Environment and
Development attached to United Nations Organization, also known as Brundtland Commission or
Brundtland Report (from Gro Harlem Brundtland‟s name, who was then the Prime Minister of
Norway): sustainable development represents a development satisfying the present needs without
compromising the capacity of future generations to satisfy their own (Ardelean and Maior, 2000).
Other definitions attributed to sustainable development are as follows: sustainable
development is the economic development of mankind which completely takes into account the
ecological consequences of the economic activity, and it is based on the resources that can be
replaced or regenerated and therefore cannot be exhausted (Berca, 1998-2001); sustainable
development is nothing but a vector of the desired social objectives, obviously the ones related to
p.28); sustainability can be expressed with the help of a system of indicators. It is fundamental that
a sustainable development is based on the following three value judgements: equal rights with
future generations, leaving the inheritance of an intact nature, and an international justice (Pitea,
1999).
In the concept of sustainable development there are three main axes, as follows: sustainable
environment, social equity and economic prosperity. Most of the times, people think only about
themselves, they are too selfish to think of the future, of the future generations, and they have norms
like: having a decent and comfortable living; economic prosperity; to relax in a nice landscape, at
least in leisure time; to have access to health and education systems; to have a series of basic rights
respected; to have the perspective of a decent pension.
From these norms, we can clearly see that very few are those who are concerned about nature,
about what surrounds them, and about the fact that one should be responsible for the society and for
the environment, eliminating the indifference and demonstrating that by involving personally one
can obtain positive effects on the environment and society.
In conclusion, as a general imagine of the future society, sustainable consumption will
become a complex field, situated at the crossroads of several subjects. We should all participate in
the action of supporting a sustainable environment, because society is an immense consumer with
mechanisms directed only towards economic development, using the sustainability of natural environment
in order to develop.

2. LASTING DEVELOPMENT vs SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT

Sustainable development can be generally defined as the improvement of each person’s life
now and for the generations to come.
The concept of sustainable development promoted by United Nations forums mainly refers to:


Equitable and balanced economic development;



Higher level of employment, social cohesion and inclusion;



Assuming responsibility for the use of natural resources and of environmental protection;



Coherent, open and transparent policies;



International cooperation for global promotion of sustainable development.
Georgescu (1995) considers that the economic and social development, the state of the

environment and human health are strongly connected, conditioning one another, environment and
health constituting conditions necessary for any process of development, which can influence at its
is generally accepted that the terms lasting and sustainable can conceptually substitute one another,
we consider that we should accept a few distinctions which could prove important, including the
methodological point of view. In this context, the expressions “lasting development” or lasting
growth are quasi-correct, because both development and growth are processes necessarily
associated to social institutions (in their most general meaning), so they bear the impact generated
by the non-natural action agent.
Development or growth can only be sustainable, not lasting. Taking into account the
specialists‟ opinion, (Ţugulea, Bobâlcă and Soponaru, 2013) we can speak of lasting development
or of lasting growth only metaphorically, or by abuse of language. From a rigorous point of view,
the terms should be referred as sustainable development or sustainable growth.
The acceptance of the concept of lasting development by the Romanian authors (Cămășoiu,
1994, p.24) led to a series of semantic or pragmatic difficulties.
The concept of lasting / sustainable is considered by Bănacu (2004) a debatable topic, due to
an erroneous understanding of the semantics of the words mentioned. Consequently, he gives further
explanations with the intention to justify his preference for the use of the expression sustainable
development:
the expression sustainable development is taken from Anglo-Saxon literature. The term
sustainable originates from Latin, the verb sustenare meaning to sustain, to support and also to selfsupport.
the term sustainability has the same meaning in other Latin languages, like Spanish
(sustenabilidade), Italian (sustenabilita) or Portuguese (sustentavel). It means a state of continuous
balance due not only to the capacity of a system to be consumer of (primary) resources, but also to
its capacity to create its own resources, to follow a regenerative cycle.
according to Merriam Webster Dictionary, a lasting system is a system existing or continuing
for a long time. This does not necessarily mean that it would be in harmony with nature (which is
required by the principles of sustainability), neither that it would have the possibility to create its
own resources (to self-support). For example, a rock is lasting in time, and a tree or any living
organism is sustainable, because it has the capacity to sustain, to support itself – to integrate in a
natural cycle.
the term sustainability cannot be considered a neologism in Romanian (perhaps only
partially), due to its Latin origin (the verb sustenare) with corresponding Romanian words (a sustine
– to sustain/support, a se sustine, a se intretine - to support itself).
by the presence or absence of dissipative systems in the process or system analysed. From this point
of view, it is considered that the reference to durability (lasting systems) as a dynamic characteristic
of processes or systems, excludes the natural environment where there are no dissipative systems;
in any natural environment where there are dissipative (human or non-human) systems, we cannot
speak of durability anymore, only of sustainability.
The concept of lasting has the significance of persistence in time of a structure or entity, while
the concept of sustainable has rather the meaning of the possibility to maintain in time that entity or
structure, in an attractive way (Jugănaru, 2007, p.247).
In such an approach, we may consider a rock as being lasting if it has no intervention upon it,
but a public institution can prove to be sustainable. From this perspective, we can make a semantic
distinction between the two concepts, considering the aspect of their connection with the action
agent.
On the other hand, while durability denotes only the aspect of being stationary, sustainability
may also refer to a dose of growth or ungrowth. In other words, there might be a sustainable
development or an unsustainable development, or a sustainable growth or an unsustainable growth,
as well as a sustainable ungrowth or an unsustainable ungrowth (Theobald, 1998).
In such an approach, we consider it is correct to use the terms sustainable development or
sustainable growth.

4. MODEL OF SUSTAINABLE TOURISM DEVELOPMENT

According to Vellas, sustainable tourism development belongs to the process of planning the
activities whose purpose is to avoid any actions affecting the very bases of development, as follows:
ecosystems degradation, endangering the cultural patrimony, brutal modification of traditions and
people‟s life style, as well as competition for the access to equipment and infrastructure. (Vellas,
2002, p.190)
Consequently, sustainable tourism development is related to anadequate environmental
management. There are several ways by which it may be assured. A model of sustainable tourism
development is presented in Figure 1 (Buckley, 1996).
This model of tourism development should be applied in all the regions of great tourist
attraction.
Starting with this model, we consider that sustainable tourism development should be
approached from the very stages of design and construction of tourist equipment in order to avoid
continued to the stage of tourism activity development, when the effects over the environment could
be controlled through the authorised organisms, and when strategies could be established to resolve
the deficiencies, to adequately equip ecologically the tourist endowment.

cooperation among authorities (who possess the legislative, economic, social instruments, other
regulatory documents of public interest), economic agents (who initiate projects of improvement
and tourist services), defenders of the environmental protection and cultural patrimony, local
providers of tourist services, tour-operators and tourism agents, and last but not least, tourists - as
beneficiaries.
In practice, we have come to the conclusion that there were two separate coordinates
applicable in tourism in what concerned sustainability (Ștefănică, 2010). The first and the most
important coordinate on long term consists of improving sustainable practices at the destinations
chosen by tourists, where they can have a negative impact over the natural environment (for
example, the erosion of coral reefs by recreation activities, or of mountains by skiing and hiking,
excessive use of fresh water for bathing, swimming, watering the gardens, the golf courses, water
pollution by dumping untreated waste in rivers, and carbon dioxide emissions by the use of
automobiles), as well as over the socio-cultural environment (for example, the transformation of art
and traditional customs in a form of animation and profit for the hotels, imposing behavioural and
cultural norms of abundance, characteristic especially to Western societies, to the cultures who are
not familiar with such methods, by a process often called neo-colonialism).
However, in contrast with other industries, comparable as dimension and relevance, tourism
industry has the potential to contribute positively and in a great measure to the welfare of the
destinations visited. The opportunity to exploit these positive, sustainable contributions is making
tourism such a vital preoccupation for the 21st century.
The second coordinate refers to the modality in which the companies from tourism industry
make their operation and development decisions. Some activities take place at the destination, for
example at the hotels, B&Bs, inns, resort villages, different forms of attractions, others take place
away from destinations, for example airlines, tourism agencies or tour-operators‟ activity. Tourism
companies have as many reasons to control the pollution and to administer waste as any other
company from other industry. They even bear a greater responsibility, taking into account that they
often operate in highly attractive areas, but also very sensitive from an environmental point of view.
This becomes a problem for the design of a hotel building, or for the development of the
surrounding area. A good design of buildings and green areas can reduce very much the level of
pollution produced by a given number of tourists per day. Furthermore, it is necessary to implement
programmes for saving the energy, for the control of sound pollution and emissions, for reduction of
fresh water consumption, for lower use of toxic chemical substances, for recycling and reuse of
materials.

Sustainable tourism has the potential to promote social development by the creation of new
workplaces, redistribution of income and decrease of poverty. (Ștefănică, 2010) From an economic
point of view, the main advantages of sustainable tourism are related to foreign currency gains,
contributions to Governmental income, generation of opportunities concerning occupation of labour
and of business. Table 1 presents synthetic advantages generated by the practice of sustainable
tourism.

 Advantage offered by the
competition

Under asocial aspect, the advantages determined by the practice of sustainable tourism are
presented as follows:
 Tourism represents a force for maintaining the peace. By travelling, people have contact with
one another. Due to the fact that sustainable tourism has an educational component, it can
cultivate the understanding among people and cultures and it offers the possibility of cultural
exchanges between hosts and visitors. This leads to the increase of people‟s chances to develop
sympathies and reciprocal understanding, and to reduce prejudices.
 Strengthening the communities. Sustainable tourism can bring vitality to the communities in
many ways. An example would be the events and festivals where the locals are the main
participants, but also spectators. These events are often refreshed and organised as a result of the
interest manifested by tourists. At the same time, the workplaces created in tourism can act as an
important motivating factor in reducing the migration from rural areas. The locals can also have
and of the perspectives in what concerns the income obtained from their professional training in
the field of tourism, business development and their organisational abilities.
 Development of facilities as a benefit for the local community. In the places where tourism
industry supports the creation of facilities and services useful to the community, which
otherwise could not be developed, it can lead to reach high standards of prosperity in some
regions. These benefits can include a better infrastructure, the improvement of health system and
of transportation network, new recreational and sports facilities, restaurants and public areas, as
well as an influx of high quality food and consumption goods.
 Revitalisation of culture and traditions. Sustainable tourism has the potential to improve the
conservation and transmission of cultural and historical traditions. Contributing to the
sustainable conservation and management of natural resources, it can generally lead to the
possibility of protecting the local cultural patrimony or to the revitalisation of local cultures by
regenerating cultural arts and crafts.
 Tourism encouraging civic implication and the sense of pride. In some cases, sustainable
tourism contributes to the raise of the level of local conscientiousness concerning the financial
value of natural and cultural places. This could stimulate the sense of pride in what concerns the
local and national patrimony and develop the interest for its conservation. Consequently, the
implication of local communities in sustainable tourism development and operation seems to be
an important condition in what concerns the sustainable use and conservation of biodiversity.
 Benefits of sustainable tourism for tourists. There are many benefits for tourists: they can enjoy
the undegraded beauty of the natural environment and of the landscapes, the quality of the
environment (clean air and waters), a healthy community with low rates of criminality, the
authenticity of flourishing local traditions and culture (Ştefănică and Butnaru, 2013).
We present as follows the main economic advantages and benefits which sustainable tourism
can enhance:
 Income realised from the exchange of foreign currency. The money spent by tourists, the import
and export of goods and services generates an income for the host economy. Tourism represents
an important source in what concerns the income of foreign currency for at least 38% of the
countries. (UNWTO, n.d.)
 Contributions to the governmental income. The income realised by the government due to this
sector of tourism can be classified as direct and indirect income. The direct income is generated
by the taxes on the tourism employees‟ income, by commercial activities related to tourism, and
by the fees applied directly to tourists, like the ecological fees, or the output taxes. The indirect
tourists, for example the taxes on the souvenirs, alcohol, restaurants.
 Generation of work places. The quick expansion of tourism led to the creation of a considerable
number of work places. Tourism can generate work places directly by hotels, restaurants, taxis,
souvenir sale, and indirectly by providing goods and services which are necessary commercial
activities with in this sector (Dumitrică, 2012). According to World Tourism Organisation,
tourism represents approximately 7% of the total number of employees at a global level.
 Stimulation of investments in infrastructure. Tourism can determine the local authorities to
improve the infrastructure by creating better systems of water supply and sewage, roads,
electrical energy supply systems, telephony and public transportation networks. All these
contribute to the improvement of local residents‟ quality of life, and to the facilitation of
tourism.
 Contribution to the development of local economy. Tourism can constitute an important or even
essential part of local economy (Butnaru and Timu, 2011). Due to the fact that the environment
represents one of the basic components of the values of tourism industry, the income realised by
this sector is often used as a measure of the economic value of the protected areas. There is also
another local income which cannot be easily quantified, because not all the tourists‟ expenses
are registered officially in macroeconomic statistics. Part of the income from tourism is realised
freely, like that of street vendors or unofficial guides. The positive side of these activities which
develop freely or are not registered in statistics is that the money obtained is returned to the local
economy and has a substantial multiplicative effect, because it is introduced cyclically into the
circuit. World Tourism Organisation and Tourism Council estimate that tourism generates an
indirect contribution equal to the direct encashment from this sector.
 Direct financial contributions concerning nature protection. Tourism can contribute directly to
the conservation of the sensitive areas and habitats. The income realised by park entrance fees or
other similar sources can be al located especially for financing the protection and management
of the environmentally sensitive areas. Some governmental authorities collect these sums of
money by different exhaustive and indirect ways which are not particularly related to parks or
protected areas (Ştefănică and Butnaru, 2013). Consequently, the taxes of use, income taxes,
taxes on sale or rental of recreation equipment, and licensing fees for activities like fishing or
hunting can provide governments with the funds necessary for the administration of natural
resources.
 The advantage offered by competition. More and more tour-operators admit an active approach
concerning sustainability, not only because tourists expect them to act accordingly, but also
survival of this industry on long term. More and more tour-operators prefer to work with the
providers acting in a sustainable manner, for example saving water and energy, observing local
culture and helping the host community.
CONCLUSIONS
Due to the attention and support that sustainable development received in general, and
particularly in tourism, is still a subject of intense debate, with no consensus in what concerns its
definition and practical applicability. No matter the opinions of several researchers and analysts,
sustainable development of tourism represents the dominant approach regarding the administration
of the relationship between tourism and environment, based on a group of principles and objectives
which had been adopted almost unanimously, with the purpose to minimise the negative impact of
tourism over the environment.
In conclusion, we consider that, both theoretically and practically, sustainable tourism should
aim, on the one hand, to integrally capitalise exceptional natural and cultural resources, to improve
the quality of life in local communities, and on the other hand, to satisfy tourists‟ motivations and
requirements in close connection with environmental conservation and protection for the future
generations.

INTRODUCTION

In the last century, a change with enormous implications appeared on the list of human
priorities: instead of happiness, the first place was taken by the problem of survival (Giurgiu, n.d.).
We all know that any human activity can have positive or negative effects on the environment.
The geo-system includes several subsystems interacting with each other, with a continuous
exchange of energy and matter among them. The anthroposphere presents different interactions with
the biosphere, and it can modify it by its actions (Avramescu, 2005). The irrational environmental
exploitation for economic or social welfare reasons, which represent the main purpose of intensive
economic development, characteristic of our century, cannot be maintained on long term unless the
environment becomes completely degraded, involving risks even for the survival of human species
he also tried to explain the difference between growth and development, rejecting the concept that
the ecologists were against economic development and human society.
Daly and Cobb (1989), considered the founders of the theory of sustainable development,
elaborated between 1971 and 1981 the concept of steady state economics, which is the basis on
which the notion of sustainable economy was later consolidated. Starting with this concept of
steady state economics, the concept of sustainable development was initiated ten years later.
In 1990, the World Bank was organising in Washington an International Interdisciplinary
Conference with the subject Ecological Economics of Sustainability, when The International
Society for Ecological Economics was founded. This became a reunion of several specialists from
the entire world.
In 1992, in Rio de Janeiro, from June3rd to June 14th, the United Nations Conference on
Environment and Development took place, attended by 178 states, which was later followed by a
two-day summit, called EARTH SUMMIT (World Conference Environment and development in
Rio de Janeiro, 1992). This conference constituted the beginning of the endeavours concerning
environmental issues and sustainable development (Casey J. Dawkins, 2003). The participants in
the Summit, leaders of the states of the world, adopted there the following main documents: the Rio
Declaration; the Convention on Climate Change; the Convention on Biodiversity; the Declaration
on Desertification; Agenda 21. (Giurgiu, n.d.)
Since Romania is member of the European Union, the concept of sustainable development
should also have an impact on the territory of our country. Nowadays, not only that the concept of
sustainable development is of great interest, but it also has a long perspective. Sustainable
development, among several other roles, also contributes to change the life style, and it makes us, in
a certain way, become better and more tolerant.

1. SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT – CONCEPTUAL APPROACH

Taking into account the concept of sustainable development, we can state that this mainly
refers to the problem of resources. All the evidence shows a real concern for our planet and the
natural resources, which are limited quantitatively. Also, our environment is more and more
polluted, and the population of the planet is continuously growing, which does not limit the main
problem of sustainability only to strictly economic aspects. On the contrary, efforts are made to
optimally combine the economic aspects (concerning the resources) with the social ones
protection and pollution reduction).
A sustainable development should allow human life to continue, and it should also assure
environmental protection from the activities of the society. Some natural disasters appeared not only
as a result of high risk activities, but also due to the way we behaved with the place where we
developed our daily activities (Ţugulea, et al., 2013). The greenhouse effect, acid rain,
desertification, ozone holes, pollution, destruction of forests and of biodiversity, erosion are
indicated as evidence that an economic development with no limits is a way with no return, which
can lead no more to economic welfare; the natural capital and the patrimony left by our ancestors
should persuade us to reinitiate a truly sustainable economy.
According to Tiezzi and Marchettini (1998), the new theories of sustainable development and
ecological economy confront us with a paradigm: today there is no economy based on two
parameters (capital and work), but an ecological economy which admits the existence of three
parameters: work, natural capital, and capital produced by man. Consequently, we consider that
sustainable development also represents a problem of relationships and interdependence. Carrying
capacity is the capacity of the planet to support the population and other life forms, flora and fauna,
which man and nature need in order to survive. This is the basis of sustainability.
Over the time, it is obvious that from a rich world concerning the natural capital and a poor
world concerning the capital produced by man, we passed to a very poor world from a natural point
of view, and rich in what concerns the capital produced by man. (Ţugulea et al., 2014)
Consequently, Rudolf (1985), the founder of thermodynamics, stated: In a nation’s economy, there
is a generally available law: the consumption should never be higher than what can be produced in
the same period of time. This is why we should consume no more fuel than it can be possibly
reproduced by tree growth.
A very clear definition was given within the World Commission on Environment and
Development attached to United Nations Organization, also known as Brundtland Commission or
Brundtland Report (from Gro Harlem Brundtland‟s name, who was then the Prime Minister of
Norway): sustainable development represents a development satisfying the present needs without
compromising the capacity of future generations to satisfy their own (Ardelean and Maior, 2000).
Other definitions attributed to sustainable development are as follows: sustainable
development is the economic development of mankind which completely takes into account the
ecological consequences of the economic activity, and it is based on the resources that can be
replaced or regenerated and therefore cannot be exhausted (Berca, 1998-2001); sustainable
development is nothing but a vector of the desired social objectives, obviously the ones related to
p.28); sustainability can be expressed with the help of a system of indicators. It is fundamental that
a sustainable development is based on the following three value judgements: equal rights with
future generations, leaving the inheritance of an intact nature, and an international justice (Pitea,
1999).
In the concept of sustainable development there are three main axes, as follows: sustainable
environment, social equity and economic prosperity. Most of the times, people think only about
themselves, they are too selfish to think of the future, of the future generations, and they have norms
like: having a decent and comfortable living; economic prosperity; to relax in a nice landscape, at
least in leisure time; to have access to health and education systems; to have a series of basic rights
respected; to have the perspective of a decent pension.
From these norms, we can clearly see that very few are those who are concerned about nature,
about what surrounds them, and about the fact that one should be responsible for the society and for
the environment, eliminating the indifference and demonstrating that by involving personally one
can obtain positive effects on the environment and society.
In conclusion, as a general imagine of the future society, sustainable consumption will
become a complex field, situated at the crossroads of several subjects. We should all participate in
the action of supporting a sustainable environment, because society is an immense consumer with
mechanisms directed only towards economic development, using the sustainability of natural environment
in order to develop.

2. LASTING DEVELOPMENT vs SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT

Sustainable development can be generally defined as the improvement of each person’s life
now and for the generations to come.
The concept of sustainable development promoted by United Nations forums mainly refers to:


Equitable and balanced economic development;



Higher level of employment, social cohesion and inclusion;



Assuming responsibility for the use of natural resources and of environmental protection;



Coherent, open and transparent policies;



International cooperation for global promotion of sustainable development.
Georgescu (1995) considers that the economic and social development, the state of the

environment and human health are strongly connected, conditioning one another, environment and
health constituting conditions necessary for any process of development, which can influence at its
is generally accepted that the terms lasting and sustainable can conceptually substitute one another,
we consider that we should accept a few distinctions which could prove important, including the
methodological point of view. In this context, the expressions “lasting development” or lasting
growth are quasi-correct, because both development and growth are processes necessarily
associated to social institutions (in their most general meaning), so they bear the impact generated
by the non-natural action agent.
Development or growth can only be sustainable, not lasting. Taking into account the
specialists‟ opinion, (Ţugulea, Bobâlcă and Soponaru, 2013) we can speak of lasting development
or of lasting growth only metaphorically, or by abuse of language. From a rigorous point of view,
the terms should be referred as sustainable development or sustainable growth.
The acceptance of the concept of lasting development by the Romanian authors (Cămășoiu,
1994, p.24) led to a series of semantic or pragmatic difficulties.
The concept of lasting / sustainable is considered by Bănacu (2004) a debatable topic, due to
an erroneous understanding of the semantics of the words mentioned. Consequently, he gives further
explanations with the intention to justify his preference for the use of the expression sustainable
development:
the expression sustainable development is taken from Anglo-Saxon literature. The term
sustainable originates from Latin, the verb sustenare meaning to sustain, to support and also to selfsupport.
the term sustainability has the same meaning in other Latin languages, like Spanish
(sustenabilidade), Italian (sustenabilita) or Portuguese (sustentavel). It means a state of continuous
balance due not only to the capacity of a system to be consumer of (primary) resources, but also to
its capacity to create its own resources, to follow a regenerative cycle.
according to Merriam Webster Dictionary, a lasting system is a system existing or continuing
for a long time. This does not necessarily mean that it would be in harmony with nature (which is
required by the principles of sustainability), neither that it would have the possibility to create its
own resources (to self-support). For example, a rock is lasting in time, and a tree or any living
organism is sustainable, because it has the capacity to sustain, to support itself – to integrate in a
natural cycle.
the term sustainability cannot be considered a neologism in Romanian (perhaps only
partially), due to its Latin origin (the verb sustenare) with corresponding Romanian words (a sustine
– to sustain/support, a se sustine, a se intretine - to support itself).
by the presence or absence of dissipative systems in the process or system analysed. From this point
of view, it is considered that the reference to durability (lasting systems) as a dynamic characteristic
of processes or systems, excludes the natural environment where there are no dissipative systems;
in any natural environment where there are dissipative (human or non-human) systems, we cannot
speak of durability anymore, only of sustainability.
The concept of lasting has the significance of persistence in time of a structure or entity, while
the concept of sustainable has rather the meaning of the possibility to maintain in time that entity or
structure, in an attractive way (Jugănaru, 2007, p.247).
In such an approach, we may consider a rock as being lasting if it has no intervention upon it,
but a public institution can prove to be sustainable. From this perspective, we can make a semantic
distinction between the two concepts, considering the aspect of their connection with the action
agent.
On the other hand, while durability denotes only the aspect of being stationary, sustainability
may also refer to a dose of growth or ungrowth. In other words, there might be a sustainable
development or an unsustainable development, or a sustainable growth or an unsustainable growth,
as well as a sustainable ungrowth or an unsustainable ungrowth (Theobald, 1998).
In such an approach, we consider it is correct to use the terms sustainable development or
sustainable growth.

4. MODEL OF SUSTAINABLE TOURISM DEVELOPMENT

According to Vellas, sustainable tourism development belongs to the process of planning the
activities whose purpose is to avoid any actions affecting the very bases of development, as follows:
ecosystems degradation, endangering the cultural patrimony, brutal modification of traditions and
people‟s life style, as well as competition for the access to equipment and infrastructure. (Vellas,
2002, p.190)
Consequently, sustainable tourism development is related to anadequate environmental
management. There are several ways by which it may be assured. A model of sustainable tourism
development is presented in Figure 1 (Buckley, 1996).
This model of tourism development should be applied in all the regions of great tourist
attraction.
Starting with this model, we consider that sustainable tourism development should be
approached from the very stages of design and construction of tourist equipment in order to avoid
continued to the stage of tourism activity development, when the effects over the environment could
be controlled through the authorised organisms, and when strategies could be established to resolve
the deficiencies, to adequately equip ecologically the tourist endowment.

cooperation among authorities (who possess the legislative, economic, social instruments, other
regulatory documents of public interest), economic agents (who initiate projects of improvement
and tourist services), defenders of the environmental protection and cultural patrimony, local
providers of tourist services, tour-operators and tourism agents, and last but not least, tourists - as
beneficiaries.
In practice, we have come to the conclusion that there were two separate coordinates
applicable in tourism in what concerned sustainability (Ștefănică, 2010). The first and the most
important coordinate on long term consists of improving sustainable practices at the destinations
chosen by tourists, where they can have a negative impact over the natural environment (for
example, the erosion of coral reefs by recreation activities, or of mountains by skiing and hiking,
excessive use of fresh water for bathing, swimming, watering the gardens, the golf courses, water
pollution by dumping untreated waste in rivers, and carbon dioxide emissions by the use of
automobiles), as well as over the socio-cultural environment (for example, the transformation of art
and traditional customs in a form of animation and profit for the hotels, imposing behavioural and
cultural norms of abundance, characteristic especially to Western societies, to the cultures who are
not familiar with such methods, by a process often called neo-colonialism).
However, in contrast with other industries, comparable as dimension and relevance, tourism
industry has the potential to contribute positively and in a great measure to the welfare of the
destinations visited. The opportunity to exploit these positive, sustainable contributions is making
tourism such a vital preoccupation for the 21st century.
The second coordinate refers to the modality in which the companies from tourism industry
make their operation and development decisions. Some activities take place at the destination, for
example at the hotels, B&Bs, inns, resort villages, different forms of attractions, others take place
away from destinations, for example airlines, tourism agencies or tour-operators‟ activity. Tourism
companies have as many reasons to control the pollution and to administer waste as any other
company from other industry. They even bear a greater responsibility, taking into account that they
often operate in highly attractive areas, but also very sensitive from an environmental point of view.
This becomes a problem for the design of a hotel building, or for the development of the
surrounding area. A good design of buildings and green areas can reduce very much the level of
pollution produced by a given number of tourists per day. Furthermore, it is necessary to implement
programmes for saving the energy, for the control of sound pollution and emissions, for reduction of
fresh water consumption, for lower use of toxic chemical substances, for recycling and reuse of
materials.

Sustainable tourism has the potential to promote social development by the creation of new
workplaces, redistribution of income and decrease of poverty. (Ștefănică, 2010) From an economic
point of view, the main advantages of sustainable tourism are related to foreign currency gains,
contributions to Governmental income, generation of opportunities concerning occupation of labour
and of business. Table 1 presents synthetic advantages generated by the practice of sustainable
tourism.

Under asocial aspect, the advantages determined by the practice of sustainable tourism are
presented as follows:
 Tourism represents a force for maintaining the peace. By travelling, people have contact with
one another. Due to the fact that sustainable tourism has an educational component, it can
cultivate the understanding among people and cultures and it offers the possibility of cultural
exchanges between hosts and visitors. This leads to the increase of people‟s chances to develop
sympathies and reciprocal understanding, and to reduce prejudices.
 Strengthening the communities. Sustainable tourism can bring vitality to the communities in
many ways. An example would be the events and festivals where the locals are the main
participants, but also spectators. These events are often refreshed and organised as a result of the
interest manifested by tourists. At the same time, the workplaces created in tourism can act as an
important motivating factor in reducing the migration from rural areas. The locals can also have
and of the perspectives in what concerns the income obtained from their professional training in
the field of tourism, business development and their organisational abilities.
 Development of facilities as a benefit for the local community. In the places where tourism
industry supports the creation of facilities and services useful to the community, which
otherwise could not be developed, it can lead to reach high standards of prosperity in some
regions. These benefits can include a better infrastructure, the improvement of health system and
of transportation network, new recreational and sports facilities, restaurants and public areas, as
well as an influx of high quality food and consumption goods.
 Revitalisation of culture and traditions. Sustainable tourism has the potential to improve the
conservation and transmission of cultural and historical traditions. Contributing to the
sustainable conservation and management of natural resources, it can generally lead to the
possibility of protecting the local cultural patrimony or to the revitalisation of local cultures by
regenerating cultural arts and crafts.
 Tourism encouraging civic implication and the sense of pride. In some cases, sustainable
tourism contributes to the raise of the level of local conscientiousness concerning the financial
value of natural and cultural places. This could stimulate the sense of pride in what concerns the
local and national patrimony and develop the interest for its conservation. Consequently, the
implication of local communities in sustainable tourism development and operation seems to be
an important condition in what concerns the sustainable use and conservation of biodiversity.
 Benefits of sustainable tourism for tourists. There are many benefits for tourists: they can enjoy
the undegraded beauty of the natural environment and of the landscapes, the quality of the
environment (clean air and waters), a healthy community with low rates of criminality, the
authenticity of flourishing local traditions and culture (Ştefănică and Butnaru, 2013).
We present as follows the main economic advantages and benefits which sustainable tourism
can enhance:
 Income realised from the exchange of foreign currency. The money spent by tourists, the import
and export of goods and services generates an income for the host economy. Tourism represents
an important source in what concerns the income of foreign currency for at least 38% of the
countries. (UNWTO, n.d.)
 Contributions to the governmental income. The income realised by the government due to this
sector of tourism can be classified as direct and indirect income. The direct income is generated
by the taxes on the tourism employees‟ income, by commercial activities related to tourism, and
by the fees applied directly to tourists, like the ecological fees, or the output taxes. The indirect
tourists, for example the taxes on the souvenirs, alcohol, restaurants.
 Generation of work places. The quick expansion of tourism led to the creation of a considerable
number of work places. Tourism can generate work places directly by hotels, restaurants, taxis,
souvenir sale, and indirectly by providing goods and services which are necessary commercial
activities with in this sector (Dumitrică, 2012). According to World Tourism Organisation,
tourism represents approximately 7% of the total number of employees at a global level.
 Stimulation of investments in infrastructure. Tourism can determine the local authorities to
improve the infrastructure by creating better systems of water supply and sewage, roads,
electrical energy supply systems, telephony and public transportation networks. All these
contribute to the improvement of local residents‟ quality of life, and to the facilitation of
tourism.
 Contribution to the development of local economy. Tourism can constitute an important or even
essential part of local economy (Butnaru and Timu, 2011). Due to the fact that the environment
represents one of the basic components of the values of tourism industry, the income realised by
this sector is often used as a measure of the economic value of the protected areas. There is also
another local income which cannot be easily quantified, because not all the tourists‟ expenses
are registered officially in macroeconomic statistics. Part of the income from tourism is realised
freely, like that of street vendors or unofficial guides. The positive side of these activities which
develop freely or are not registered in statistics is that the money obtained is returned to the local
economy and has a substantial multiplicative effect, because it is introduced cyclically into the
circuit. World Tourism Organisation and Tourism Council estimate that tourism generates an
indirect contribution equal to the direct encashment from this sector.
 Direct financial contributions concerning nature protection. Tourism can contribute directly to
the conservation of the sensitive areas and habitats. The income realised by park entrance fees or
other similar sources can be al located especially for financing the protection and management
of the environmentally sensitive areas. Some governmental authorities collect these sums of
money by different exhaustive and indirect ways which are not particularly related to parks or
protected areas (Ştefănică and Butnaru, 2013). Consequently, the taxes of use, income taxes,
taxes on sale or rental of recreation equipment, and licensing fees for activities like fishing or
hunting can provide governments with the funds necessary for the administration of natural
resources.
 The advantage offered by competition. More and more tour-operators admit an active approach
concerning sustainability, not only because tourists expect them to act accordingly, but also
survival of this industry on long term. More and more tour-operators prefer to work with the
providers acting in a sustainable manner, for example saving water and energy, observing local
culture and helping the host community.
CONCLUSIONS
Due to the attention and support that sustainable development received in general, and
particularly in tourism, is still a subject of intense debate, with no consensus in what concerns its
definition and practical applicability. No matter the opinions of several researchers and analysts,
sustainable development of tourism represents the dominant approach regarding the administration
of the relationship between tourism and environment, based on a group of principles and objectives
which had been adopted almost unanimously, with the purpose to minimise the negative impact of
tourism over the environment.
In conclusion, we consider that, both theoretically and practically, sustainable tourism should
aim, on the one hand, to integrally capitalise exceptional natural and cultural resources, to improve
the quality of life in local communities, and on the other hand, to satisfy tourists‟ motivations and
requirements in close connection with environmental conservation and protection for the future
generations.
