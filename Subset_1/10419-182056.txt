Inventory control is the activity which organizes the
availability of items to the customers. Managing
inventory of an organization plays a vital role in the
supply chain. A supply chain is a network of facilities
that procure raw materials, transform them into
intermediate goods and then to final products, and
finally deliver the products to customers through a
distribution system that includes an inventory system.
Thus, it spans procurement, manufacturing, and
distribution with an effective inventory management
as one key element. To fill orders efficiently, it is
necessary to understand the linkages and

interrelationships of all the key elements of the
supply chain. In addressing this issue, many
researchers such as Ghare and Schrader (1963),
Covert and Philip (1973), Ouyang et al. (2002), Teng
(2002), Udayakumar and Geetha (2014, 2016), Jaggi
et al. (2015), Geetha and Udayakumar (2015, 2016)
developed the economic order quantity (EOQ) model
under various assumptions. Recently, Udayakumar
and Geetha (2017) established an EOQ model with a
two level storage facility under trade credit policy.
Therefore, integrated management of the supply
chain has become a key success factor for some of
today's leading companies. Coordination between the
two different business entities (vendor and buyer) is
an important mean to increase the competitive
advantage because coordinative strategy lowers the
supply chain cost and increases their revenue. The
cooperation between vendor and buyer for improving
the performance of inventory control has received a
great deal of attention, and the integration approach
has been studied for years. The study of the
integrated supplier-retailer inventory model was first
advocated by Goyal (1996). Subsequently, many
researchers investigated this issue under various
assumptions. Hill (1997) developed an integrated
single-vendor single-buyer production inventory
model with a generalized policy. Sarmah et al. (2006)
gave an intended literature review to cover the entire
gamut of supply chain coordination mechanism. Yao
et al. (2007) established the supply chain integration
model based on vendor managed inventory. Giri and
Sharma (2014) gave manufacturer’s pricing strategies
in cooperative and non-cooperative advertising
supply chain under retail competition. Rajkumar et
al. (2016) presented a doctoral dissertation in
logistics and supply chain management.
It is common yet unrealistic to assume that all the
units produced are of good quality. The classical
Economic Order Quantity (EOQ) model assumes that
the items produced are of perfect quality, which is
usually not the case in real production. Huang (2001)
developed an integrated inventory model for supplier
and retailer with defective items. In his article, he
incorporates the view of the integrated supplierretailer approach into the inventory model with
of an imperfect item for vendor and buyer. Hsu &
Hsu (2012 & 2013) derived an integrated singlevendor single-buyer production-inventory model for
items with imperfect quality and inspection errors.
Hsu & Hsu (2014) gave a supplement to an EOQ
model with imperfect quality items, inspection errors,
shortage backordering, and sales return. Kundu and
Chakraborti (2015) derived an integrated multi stage
supply chain inventory model with imperfect
production process.
In some practical situations, lead time and ordering
cost can be controlled and reduced in various ways.
When the demand during the cycle period is not
deterministic but is stochastic, lead time becomes an
important issue and its control leads to many benefits.
The lead time can be reduced by an additional
crashing cost. In this direction, Goyal (2003) gave a
note on controlling the controllable lead time
component in the integrated inventory model.
Ouyang et al. (2007) established an integrated
vendor-buyer inventory model with quality
improvement and lead time reduction. Annadurai
and Uthayakumar (2010) gave the model with
investment in setup cost with defective items.
Trade credit is an essential tool for financial growth
for many businesses. In order to encourage sales,
such a credit is given. During this credit period the
retailer can accumulate and earn interest on the
encouraged sales revenue. In spite of the extension
period the supplier charges interest on the unpaid
balance. Hence, the permissible delay period
indirectly reduces the cost of holding cost. Also trade
credit offered by the supplier encourages the retailer
to buy more products. Hence, the trade credit plays a
major role in inventory control for both the supplier
as well as the retailer. The integration between the
vendor and the buyer for improving the performance
of inventory control with permissible delay in
payment plays the major role to minimize the joint
total cost for any business firm. Ouyang et al. (2008)
established an optimal strategy for an integrated
system with variable production rate when the freight
rate and the trade credit are both linked to the order
quantity. Ouyang et al. (2015) considered the model
with capacity constraint and order size dependent
trade credit. Uthayakumar and Priyan (2013) derived
two echelon inventory models with controllable setup
cost and lead time under service level constraint with
permissible delay in payment. Moreover, in the
model developed by Uthayakumar and Priyan (2013),
have considered two echelon inventory systems with
delay in payment and controllable setup cost under
service level constraint. In the present work, we have
developed a single vendor single buyer integrated
inventory model with permissible delay in payment
and controllable lead time in an imperfect production
process through service level constraint. An
inspection policy is taken to identify the defective

items. The lead time crashing cost is assumed to be
an exponential function of lead time. The lead time
demand follows a normal distribution and the lead
time is crashed to minimize the joint total expected
cost per unit time. The vendor's setup cost is reduced
by some capital investment. Numerical example is
provided to illustrate the model. Sensitivity analyses
with managerial implications are discussed.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. The
assumptions and notations which are used throughout
the article are presented in Section 2. In Section 3,
mathematical model to minimize the total cost is
formulated. In Section 4, the solution methodology
comprising some useful theoretical result to find the
optimal solution is given. Computational algorithm is
designed to obtain the optimal values in the Section
5. Numerical example is provided in Section 6 to
illustrate the theory and the solution procedure.
Following this, in Section 7, Sensitivity analysis for
the major parameters of the inventory system has
been analyzed. Managerial implications with respect
to the sensitivity analysis were given in Section 8.
Finally, we draw a conclusion in Section 9.

2.2 Assumptions
1. The inventory model deals with single-buyer and
single-vendor with single item.
2. The buyer orders a lot size of 𝑄𝑄 units and the
vendor produces 𝑛𝑛𝑛𝑛 units with a finite production
rate 𝑃𝑃, (𝑃𝑃 > 𝐷𝐷 ) in units per unit time in one
setup but ships in quantity 𝑄𝑄 units to the buyer
over 𝑛𝑛 times.
The buyer’s shortages are
completely backordered.
3. The production process is imperfect and may
produce defective items. On arrival, the items are
inspected in a complete inspection process with
an inspection cost of 𝑐𝑐 𝑖𝑖 and all defective items
are returned to the vendor in the next shipment.
A defective item incurs a cost of 𝑐𝑐 𝑑𝑑 for the
vendor. The vendor will sell the defective items
at a reduced price to a secondary market at the
end of the production period within each cycle. In
other words, 𝑐𝑐 𝑑𝑑 is the difference between the
regular and the reduced selling prices.
4. The percentage of defective items produced 𝜀𝜀 has
a probability density function 𝑓𝑓(𝜀𝜀). To guarantee
that the vendor has enough production capacity to
produce the buyer’s annual demand, it is assumed
that 𝜀𝜀 < 1 − 𝐷𝐷/𝑃𝑃.
5. The inventory is continuously reviewed and the
order is placed whenever the inventory level falls
to the reorder point 𝑟𝑟. The reorder point 𝑟𝑟 =
𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 + 𝜏𝜏𝜏𝜏√𝐿𝐿, where 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 is the expected demand
during lead time, 𝜏𝜏 the safety factor and
satisfies 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃(𝑋𝑋 > 𝑟𝑟) = 𝑞𝑞, 𝑞𝑞 represents the
allowable stock-out probability during lead time
and 𝜎𝜎, the standard deviation of the lead time
demand.
6. The lead time crashing cost per order 𝑅𝑅(𝐿𝐿), is
assumed to be an exponential function of 𝐿𝐿 and is
0
𝑖𝑖 𝑖𝑖 𝐿𝐿 = 𝐿𝐿0
defined as 𝑅𝑅(𝐿𝐿) = � 𝐶𝐶/𝐿𝐿
, where
𝑒𝑒
𝑖𝑖 𝑖𝑖 𝐿𝐿 𝑏𝑏 ≤ 𝐿𝐿 < 𝐿𝐿0
𝐶𝐶 is a positive constant and 𝐿𝐿0 and 𝐿𝐿 𝑏𝑏 represent
the existing and the shortest lead times,
respectively.
7. 𝑀𝑀 is less than the reorder point, i.e. credit period
should not be longer than the time at which next
order is placed.

MODEL DEVELOPMENT

In this section, based on the above notations and
assumptions, we have developed a model for vendorbuyer integrated inventory system for defective
items, with controllable lead time and setup cost
under permissible delay in payment to minimize the
joint total expected cost per unit time subject to
service level constraint on the buyer. The inventory
pattern for the vendor and the buyer is shown in
Figure 1.

components:

i.e. (ℎ 𝑏𝑏 + 𝐼𝐼 𝑝𝑝 )𝑐𝑐 𝑏𝑏 𝜏𝜏𝜏𝜏√𝐿𝐿.
According to our assumption, the credit period
cannot be greater than the ordering time.
Therefore, when the buyer’s permissible delay
period expires on or before all inventories are
depleted completely, the buyer can sell the items
and earn interest with the rate of 𝐼𝐼𝑒𝑒 until the end
of the credit period 𝑀𝑀. Hence, the buyer’s

In addition, the expected shortage 𝐵𝐵(𝑟𝑟) is
completely backordered in the previous cycle,
which is cleared in the beginning of the current
cycle, therefore, during the trade credit period the

interest earned per unit time is

On the other hand, the buyer still has (𝑄𝑄 − 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷)
units unsold at the end of the permissible delay.
Hence, the buyer has a loan for the unpaid
purchase cost of unsold units with the interest
charge of 𝐼𝐼 𝑝𝑝 . Therefore, the opportunity interest

where 𝐸𝐸[𝑥𝑥] denotes the expected value of 𝑥𝑥.
3.4 Buyer’s Service level constraint
The lead time demand 𝑋𝑋 follows a normal probability
distribution function with mean 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 and standard
deviation 𝜎𝜎√𝐿𝐿and the reorder point, 𝑟𝑟 = 𝐷𝐷𝐷𝐷 + 𝜏𝜏𝜏𝜏√𝐿𝐿,
where 𝜏𝜏 is the safety factor and 𝜎𝜎, the standard
deviation of the lead time demand. Therefore, the
buyer's expected demand shortages at the end of the
cycle is given by
∞

𝐸𝐸(𝑋𝑋 − 𝑟𝑟)+ = 𝐵𝐵(𝑟𝑟) = � (𝑥𝑥 − 𝑟𝑟)𝑓𝑓(𝑥𝑥)𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑 = 𝜎𝜎√𝐿𝐿 𝜓𝜓(𝜏𝜏)
𝑟𝑟

where 𝜓𝜓(𝜏𝜏) = 𝜑𝜑(𝜏𝜏) − 𝜏𝜏[1 − 𝜙𝜙(𝜏𝜏)] > 0 and 𝜑𝜑, 𝜙𝜙 are
the standard normal p.d.f and cumulative distribution
function respectively. In developing, the joint total

expected cost of the system, the stockout cost term
for the buyer is not considered. Normally, it is
complicated to calculate the penalty costs associated
with a shortage, as a stock-out event may include
uncertain manipulates. As a result, authors like Jha
and Shankar (2009, 2013), Moon et. al. (2014),
Annadurai and Uthayakumar (2010) assumed that the
buyer has set a target service level corresponding to
the proportion of demand to be satisfied directly from
the available stock. Hence, a service level constraint
puts a limit on the proportion of demand that is not
met from the stock. From assumption (5), the actual
proportion of demand that is not met from the stock
should not exceed the desired value of 𝛼𝛼. Hence, the
Service level constraint can be expressed as

SOLUTION PROCEDURE

In order to find the minimum total cost for this
constrained nonlinear programming problem, we first
have temporarily ignored the service level constraint
(SLC), 0 < 𝑘𝑘 𝑣𝑣 < 𝑘𝑘 𝑣𝑣0 and have relaxed the integer
requirement on 𝑛𝑛, then have tried to find the optimal
classical
solution
of
𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸(𝑄𝑄, 𝐿𝐿, 𝑘𝑘 𝑣𝑣 , 𝑛𝑛)with
optimization technique.
For fixed 𝑄𝑄 and 𝐿𝐿 ∈ (𝐿𝐿 𝑏𝑏 , 𝐿𝐿0 ), 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸(𝑄𝑄, 𝐿𝐿, 𝑘𝑘 𝑣𝑣 , 𝑛𝑛) can be
proved to be a convex function of 𝑛𝑛.
Proposition 1:
For fixed 𝑄𝑄, 𝑘𝑘 𝑣𝑣 and 𝐿𝐿 ∈ (𝐿𝐿 𝑏𝑏 , 𝐿𝐿0 ), 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸(𝑄𝑄, 𝐿𝐿, 𝑘𝑘 𝑣𝑣 , 𝑛𝑛) is
convex in 𝑛𝑛.
Proof: Taking the first and the second partial

SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS

Now, we examine the effects of changes in the
system parameters 𝑘𝑘, 𝑘𝑘 𝑣𝑣 , 𝐷𝐷, 𝛽𝛽 and 𝑀𝑀 on the optimal
ordering quantity 𝑄𝑄 and setup cost 𝑘𝑘 𝑣𝑣 and total
expected annual cost. The optimal values of
𝑄𝑄, 𝐿𝐿, 𝑘𝑘 𝑣𝑣 , 𝑛𝑛 and 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸(𝑄𝑄, 𝐿𝐿, 𝑘𝑘 𝑣𝑣 , 𝑛𝑛) are obtained when
one of the parameters changes (increases or
decreases) by 25% and all the other parameters
remain unchanged. The results of sensitivity analysis
are presented in Table 1. On the basis of the results
obtained, the following observations can be made:
1. From Table-1, we infer that the demand rate 𝐷𝐷 is

integrated
expected
total
cost 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸(𝑄𝑄 ∗ , 𝐿𝐿∗ , 𝑘𝑘 𝑣𝑣 ∗ , 𝑛𝑛∗ ) increase while 𝑘𝑘 𝑣𝑣 ∗
decreases with an increase in the value of the
parameter 𝐷𝐷. The results obtained are given in
Fig 2.
When the ordering cost 𝑘𝑘 increases, the optimal
order quantity 𝑄𝑄∗ and the total expected cost
𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸(𝑄𝑄 ∗ , 𝐿𝐿∗ , 𝑘𝑘 𝑣𝑣 ∗ , 𝑛𝑛∗ ) increases without affecting
the lead time. The graphical representation is
shown in Fig 3.
From Fig 4, we see that, when the holding cost ℎ
increases, there is an increase in the optimal order
quantity 𝑄𝑄 ∗ and the total expected cost
𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸(𝑄𝑄 ∗ , 𝐿𝐿∗ , 𝑘𝑘 𝑣𝑣 ∗ , 𝑛𝑛∗ ).
From Fig 5, we see that, increase in 𝛽𝛽 , results in
increase
in
the
expected
total
cost
𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸(𝑄𝑄 ∗ , 𝐿𝐿∗ , 𝑘𝑘 𝑣𝑣 ∗ , 𝑛𝑛∗ )of the integrated system.
When duration of the credit period 𝑀𝑀 increases,
the expected total cost 𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸(𝑄𝑄∗ , 𝐿𝐿∗ , 𝑘𝑘 𝑣𝑣 ∗ , 𝑛𝑛∗ ) of
the integrated system decreases. The graphical
representation is shown in Fig 6.
MANAGERIAL IMPLICATIONS

In this section, we present some managerial insights
of the proposed model based on the numerical results
and sensitivity analyses. When the demand rate is
high, the vendor may lose production efficiency
which results in high total cost. Therefore, the design
of production capacity is important in controlling the
production cost. Also, the benefit of the integrated
model is more significant for high values of demand
rate. From inventory point of view, the retailer should
order more quantity per order when the ordering cost
is high. Also, it is advised that the retailer should take
steps to reduce the ordering cost per order by some
capital investment. The obtained result shows that the
integrated expected total cost of our system is
sensitive with increase in ℎ. From Fig 5, we infer
that, increase in 𝛽𝛽 , results in increase in the expected
total cost of the integrated system. For higher values
of 𝛽𝛽, the total expected cost is high and the order
quantity is low. From the managerial view point, it is
advised that the supplier should find some measure to
decrease the defective rate. That is, the supplier
should entertain quality production to reduce the total
expected cost of the supply chain. From economical
point of view, if the supplier provides a permissible
delay in payments, the retailer will order lower
quantity in order to take the benefits of the
permissible delay more frequently.

CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK

In this article, a mathematical model is developed to
determine an optimum integrated vendor-buyer
inventory policy for defective items where
permissible delay in payment is offered by the vendor
to the buyer. The vendor's setup cost is crashed by an
extra crashing cost. Lead time is considered and the
lead time demand follows a normal distribution. The
lead time, order quantity, setup cost and the number
of shipments per production cycle are obtained
considering the service level constraint so that, the
expected total system cost can be minimized. By
controlling the setup cost by an investment,
significant amount of savings can be achieved. Our
results show that, when the vendor offers trade credit
period, the buyer should use it to the maximum
extent and order more quantity so that the expected
total cost of the integrated system is reduced. From
our analysis, when the defective rate is high, the
buyer should order less, i.e., the quality of the
product plays a vital role in the integrated model and
necessary steps may be taken by the vendor to reduce
the defective rate. The proposed model can be used
in industries like refrigerator, air-conditioner,
washing machine, television, printers etc.
In future, possible extension of this work may be
conducted by considering the minimax distribution
free procedure to determine the optimal values and
also it would be interesting research topic to consider
general types of investment functions and their
associated marginal cost behavior. This model can be
further extended by considering the reorder point as a
decision variable.
