
The reduction of poverty and inequality as well as the promotion of human
performance and capabilities has become of increasing interest in the economic
development debate (Sen 1982). At the same time, improving education, health,
sanitation and other social services has become a priority for the governments
´
(Suescun 2007). In this context, two separate questions have attracted the interest of
policymakers and researchers. The ﬁrst is related to the effectiveness of social
policies in terms of providing access to education among low-income groups, the
creation of employment opportunities or the social protection of certain excluded
population sectors (United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and
the Caribbean 2012). The second deals with the analysis of the determinants of
social expenditure levels and their growth, as they have a direct inﬂuence on human
development. This paper belongs to the second group of studies, as it examines the
factors that inﬂuence convergence in social spending across 17 Latin American
countries for the period 1990–2012.1
A large number of studies have attributed the restructuring of the welfare state
to the growth of globalisation. On one hand, there is the pessimistic view that
welfare provision would converge to a new low-level social expenditure
equilibrium, because of globalisation and increasing economic vulnerability, and
capital outﬂows, irrespective of ideology (Strange 1996; Friedman 2000; Swank
2001). On the optimistic side, Boix (1998) stresses that globalisation allows leftist
parties to expand their activities in human capital formation, expanding the
welfare state more than right-wing parties do. Consequently, divergence in welfare
effort is more likely to continue (Kitter and Obinger 2003). Pierson (2001)
supports a third view, called ‘‘the politics of blame avoidance’’, since efforts to
scale down the welfare state involve high risks of electoral punishment. Therefore,
he argues that partisan differences will disappear, and governments will attempt to
renegotiate and restructure the welfare state under pressure from international
competition. In the long run, however, welfare states may become more like each
other, since all the nations are anxious to make their welfare systems more
competitive, although the ways in which these adjustments are accomplished differ
from country to country (Kitter and Obinger 2003, 22), depending on their
institutional legacies. Kitter and Obinger (2003), following Flora (1986), describe
a natural process of saturation and therefore convergence to the long-term
equilibrium of an upper-limit welfare state. They accept the catch-up hypothesis
across OECD countries, where the social effort path is dependent upon past
spending levels. Behind this idea lies the assumption of an absolute beta

The ECLAC dataset covers the period 1990-2014. However, we have excluded from the analysis the
four Caribbean countries for which the ECLAC does not provide information (Cuba, Jamaica, the
Dominican Republic and Trinidad and Tobago). We also decided to exclude the data for 2013 and 2014,
because few countries have provided information about social expenditures (Argentina, Chile, Costa
the saturation effect.2
¨
Puss et al. (2005) ﬁnd the presence of statistically signiﬁcant beta convergence
for total and per capita social expenditure at purchasing power parity (PPP) as a
share of GDP for EU countries over the period 1993–2000. Starke et al. (2008) ﬁnd
beta convergence in 21 OECD countries from 1980 to 2003, which reveals an
upward trend over time. Even so, they observe a quite modest reduction of
disparities between countries, i.e. a lack of sigma convergence. For Latin American
countries, Lora (2009) gives an interpretation of the convergence coefﬁcient stating
that social expenditure has a certain inertia.
We agree in part with the catch-up or beta convergence hypothesis to an upperlimit social expenditure equilibrium. However, the discrete reduction in dispersion
across countries (see Table 5 in Appendix) indicates that perhaps Latin American
countries are not converging to a common upper-bounded steady state in social
effort. Instead, these results might be interpreted as evidence of conditional beta
convergence, where each country is converging to its own steady state in social
effort, which is consistent with the persistence of disparities across countries. In
social expenditure growth, these are determined by economic, demographic and
political differences across Latin American countries. In this regard, it is important
to note that social spending as a state policy in Latin America during 1990–2012 can
be divided into two clearly differentiated periods that could have affected the
inﬂuence of its economic, demographic and political determinants.
During the ﬁrst period, covering the years 1990–2000, with the implementation
of the Washington consensus, most Latin American governments carried out deep
structural and institutional reforms that were mainly focused on budgetary
discipline. These reforms encompassed policies in areas such as macroeconomic
stabilization, economic opportunities with respect to both trade and investment, and
the expansion of market forces within the domestic economy. During these years,
the role of the state was weakened in Latin American countries and social spending
was highly conditioned to ﬁscal discipline and debt repayment. Leaving aside the
macroeconomic consequences of the Washington consensus, its logic was
progressively abandoned after 2000 (Lora 2001) and the social agenda occupied a
much more prominent place during these years. In general terms, the Washington
post-consensus favoured the defence of the complementary (and not exclusive)
relationship between the market and the state, the strengthening of institutional
capacities, the implementation of reforms focused on social issues and the recovery
of public activities as a development factor. Consequently, the role of the States in
the provision of social services was strengthened, incorporating in their social
policies concepts such as the protection of rights, full citizenship and social
inclusion (Tomber 2016). Efforts to extend population coverage in social protection,
with a better quality and a wider variety of social services were central to almost all
countries in the region (Cecchini et al. 2014). To achieve these targets, ﬁscal
2

However, other studies from developing countries, have found that globalisation is not powerful
enough to change the national policies, not contributing them to converge toward a long-term common
expansion of opportunities for the poor (Kuczynski and Williamson 2003). In
addition, the majority of Latin American and Caribbean states began to undertake
counter-cyclical measures to stabilize employment, economic activity and social
vulnerability. The 2008 ﬁnancial crisis deepened this change of direction (United
Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean 2011).
Roughly, we can state that during this period, governments paid less attention to
structural ﬁscal factors and the evolution of social expenditure was more linked to
conjunctural factors.
Given that the role of the state was clearly different between these periods, it is
likely that the economic, demographic and political factors that inﬂuence social
spending growth also differed. The aim of this study is precisely to evaluate which
determinants explained differences in social spending growth during the years of the
Washington Consensus (1990–2000) and the period that followed (2001–2012).
Additionally, we will analyse whether social spending in Latin America converged
towards a common upper-bounded steady state or to speciﬁc steady states
conditioned by their country-speciﬁc characteristics. The rest of the paper is
organised as follows: Sect. 2 reviews the literature on the determinants of social
spending in developing and transition countries. Section 3 addresses the main
methodological issues highlighted in the literature and presents the methodology
used in this paper. Section 4 displays and discusses the results on the determinants
of social spending and its categories. Finally, we conclude in Sect. 4.

2 Determinants of social spending
Studies on the determinants of social spending have increased since the late 1970s,
coinciding with the implementation of social policy reforms carried out in
developed countries to strengthen their welfare states (Kittel and Obinger 2003).
Several determinants of social spending were considered, such as the ideological
orientation of governments, integration into global markets or the degree of ﬁscal
decentralisation.3 Since 2000, there has been a rising interest in analysing these
issues in developing and transition economies, given the dynamics and peculiarities
of their economic, political, institutional and demographic characteristics. In what
follows, we review the literature on the economic, demographic and political
determinants of social spending that focuses on Latin American countries.
2.1 Economic determinants of social spending
From an economic perspective, the literature has focused on globalisation as one of
the main determinants of social spending (Kaufman and Segura-Ubiergo 2001;
Avelino et al. 2005; Dreher et al. 2008; Leibrecht et al. 2011). There are two
opposing views on the effect of globalisation on social spending: the efﬁciency
hypothesis and the compensation hypothesis (Garrett 1998; Garrett and Nickerson
3

pressure on governments that favours market interests over social issues, thus
reducing social expenditures.4 Kaufman and Segura-Ubiergo (2001) ﬁnd that there
is a negative impact of trade openness on the various types of social expenditure.
Garrett and Mitchell (2001) in their study of 18 OECD countries also ﬁnd that trade
openness reduces social security spending.
On the other hand, the compensation hypothesis argues that integration into
international markets would encourage governments to increase social spending to
boost workers’ productivity and overcome greater volatility and risk. Kaufman and
Segura-Ubiergo (2001: 557) observe that the increase in international competition
may cause ‘‘social dislocation, uncertainty and unequal distributive effects’’.
Bearing in mind that public investment in human capital represents a public good,
the business sector may also demand greater investment in education, which should
help them to enhance productivity and thereby improve their competitiveness. In
this scenario, governments would see beneﬁt in increasing social expenditure to
avoid political instability, thus redistributing the risks of the increased openness of
the economy. Furthermore, ﬁnancial openness should theoretically follow a similar
logic, as businesses conducting foreign direct investment value the contribution of
¨
social expenditure through the increase in education and health standards (Gorg
et al. 2008). Several studies have found a positive effect on trade and capital
openness and public spending (Hicks and Swank 1992; Huber et al. 1993; Quinn
1997; Bernauer and Achini 2000; Swank 2001; Balle and Vaidya 2002; Bretschger
and Hettich 2002 as cited by Gemmell et al. 2008). Kaufman and Segura-Ubiergo
(2001) also ﬁnd a positive effect of capital openness in health and education
expenditures. There are also those who ﬁnd no conclusive evidence in favour of
either hypothesis. Avelino et al. (2005) observe that ﬁnancial openness puts no
constraint on government spending.5 Dreher (2006), using an index of globalisation
that includes economic, political and social integration over 30 OECD countries,
ﬁnds that globalisation does not inﬂuence government spending and social
expenditures.
Another factor that has been less analysed as a determinant of social expenditure
is public sector income. Few empirical studies have examined the role of revenue
constraints as a determinant of social spending (Garrett 1998; Kato 2003; Lindert
2004; Haggard and Kaufman 2004). They have argued that the fragile ability of
ﬁscal institutions to collect taxes could be responsible for Latin America’s low
social expenditures during the 1980s and 1990s (Haggard and Kaufman 2004). This
4

In this regard, Wibbels (2006) indicates that the negative relationship between openness and social
spending found in developing countries is caused by their dependent position in global markets. This is
mainly due to prices of primary products, which tend to be more volatile, causing sharp changes in
business cycles in developing countries. Volatility limits governments from obtaining funding from
international markets during times of crisis and any ensuing production shocks, thereby reducing their
spending capacity.

5

Moreover, several studies suggest that the compensation and the efﬁciency effects may differ
depending on the type of social expenditure. Dion (2000, 2006) for developing countries and Kaufman
and Segura-Ubiergo (2001) and Avelino et al. (2005) for Latin America, ﬁnd that trade liberalisation has a
positive impact on education and health expenditures, because it encourages governments to improve
region (Aldunate and Martner 2006). Governments with lower revenues and higher
commitments to social services are more likely to face greater constraints on social
spending, even under strong pressure from the beneﬁciaries (Haggard and Kaufman
2004). In addition, Gupta (1967) and Nomura (1991, 1995) have observed that the
rise in revenue collection goes hand in hand with economic growth. Burgess and
Stern (1993), Tanzi and Zee (2000), Fox and Gurley (2005) ﬁnd a positive
correlation between tax revenue and GDP per capita. This evidence ties in with
Wagner’s law of increasing state activity (Bird 1971), which states that government
activities grow with the economic development of a country over time, through
increasing public expenditure to satisfy social needs. Consequently, the ﬁscal
burden and its connection with GDP per capita and its growth might also explain the
dynamics of social spending.
Public indebtedness is another economic factor related to the ﬁscal burden that
could inﬂuence social expenditures. Lora and Olivera (2007) and Lora (2009) ﬁnd
that excessive debt ratio and high interest payments on debt have a restrictive effect
on social expenditure. This effect has been found to be greater in Latin American
countries which constitutes a limitation not only for social security, but also for
education and health spending (Hunter and Brown 2000; Dion 2006). Lora and
Olivera (2007) observe that non-compliance with debt servicing can raise social
spending in the short run, particularly in Latin America. However, Lora (2009) ﬁnds
the opposite for the same region, except for highly indebted countries.
There are additional economic determinants of social expenditure highlighted in
the literature. A rising unemployment rate is likely to increase social spending
(Snyder and Yackovlev 2000; Kittel and Obinger 2003; Avelino et al. 2005).
Avelino et al. (2005) argue that even if there are few unemployment programs in
Latin America, there should be a positive relationship between unemployment and
social spending, due to governments’ efforts to counteract the negative effects of
any crisis and to promote employment generation.
2.2 Demographic determinants of social spending
Social spending is also determined by the demographic structure of a country. For
instance, growth in the ageing population increases social expenditure, mostly on
health and retirement pensions, forcing many governments to restructure their social
policy due to ﬁnancial constraints. Lindert (1994, 1996) shows that an increase in
the size of the population aged over 65 in OECD countries has a strong positive
effect on social spending, especially on pensions, and negative effects on education.
Gonzalez-Eiras et al. (2007: 24) apply an overlapping-generational model to
disaggregated social spending in the United States. They observe that the
demographic transition towards an older society in the United States led to a
‘‘reallocation of government spending from productive public education to
unproductive intergenerational transfers’’. In contrast, the presence of a high
percentage of young people (under 15) raises spending on education and health and
lower social security spending. In this sense, Huber et al. (2008) ﬁnd that health
population.
2.3 Political determinants of social spending
The third set of factors that inﬂuence spending on social programs is linked to
political organisations and institutions. There is a vast body of literature that regards
the political ideology of governments to have effects on social spending. Ruggie
(1983), Diamant and Katzenstein (1986) and Rodrik (1997) emphasise that
economic liberalism has been accompanied by an increase in social protection, not
only in industrialised countries but also on a global scale, which rejects the
efﬁciency hypothesis. According to Ross (1997, 2000) and Armingeon et al. (2001),
right-wing parties are less likely to pursue policies that sustain the welfare state, due
to their lower concern for workers’ protection. Kitschelt and Herbert (2001)
maintain that centre and right-wing parties are more reluctant to cut beneﬁts or to
impose ﬁscal austerity in times of economic recession.6 Roberts (2002) and
Kitschelt et al. (2010) argue that left-wing parties do not have a signiﬁcant inﬂuence
on social policy, due to their low levels of institutionalization and the lack of
substantive differences between left and right party labels, when compared to those
in the developed countries (Niedzwiecki and Sara 2015). Hicks and EspingAndersen (2003) present a comparative analysis of the role of left- and right-wing
parties in the development of the welfare state. They observe that the correlations
between social expenditure and the political orientation of the parties seem to be
period-sensitive. In this regard, during the 1960s until the early 1980s, they ﬁnd a
positive effect of left-wing parties on social expenditure, but from that moment, the
differences between parties of the left and right tend to disappear, due to
retrenchments in the levels of social policies by left-wing governments since then.
Another related issue is whether authoritarian or democratic regimes have
different levels of social spending. Some authors believe that democratic regimes
have higher social costs due to high electoral risks. In this sense, Avelino et al.
(2005) observe that countries in transition towards democracy may be able to
increase social spending for the poor, because of the strength of this population
sector’s voting power. Regarding social spending categories, Kaufman and SeguraUbiergo (2001) and Avelino et al. (2005) ﬁnd a strong positive association between
democracy and education spending in Latin America, as governments attempt to
attract more voters through proper educational programs, or because there is a high
percentage of young people in the population, which makes it more attractive for the
government to spend on education. However, Avelino et al. (2005) do not ﬁnd any
signiﬁcant correlation between democracy and spending on health and social
security. Huber et al. (2008) indicate that, regardless of their ideological orientation,
democratic regimes have a long-term positive impact on both social security
spending and health/education spending. Conversely, highly repressive authoritarian
governments have negative effects on health and education expenditures, but they
6

See Kittel and Obinger (2003) for an extensive review of partisan politics and political institutions as
with the median voter theorem (Boix 1998; Dion 2006), which states that
democratic regimes have higher social expenditures because they take into account
the whole population in their welfare decisions and therefore the income of the
median voter is lower than it would be in authoritarian regimes, where social
spending would be targeted at the smaller group of supporters who beneﬁt from the
regime. On the other hand, authoritarian regimes may take more drastic decisions
for or against social spending than in the case of democratic regimes, due to the
absence of ‘‘veto points’’ characterised by Immergut (1990) or ‘‘veto players’’
postulated by Tsebelis (2002), provided by different political systems to interest
groups by not allowing them to gain veto power to block political reforms.
In summary, we have described an extensive list of determinants highlighted in
the literature, which may provide potential explanations about the different levels of
social expenditure in Latin American countries and their growth. We are aware that
this list is not exhaustive and that there are other variables that would be important
to consider, depending on the objectives of the research topic. For the purposes of
our study, we believe that we have covered a wide range of determinants of social
expenditures that will help us to present differences among Latin American
countries during the two periods under consideration.
The next section examines the economic, demographic and political determinants
of social spending, listing the data sources. Subsequently, some methodological
aspects are considered to properly evaluate their impact on social spending.

3 Data and variables
The measures of aggregate social expenditure as a percentage of GDP and its
categories (health, education, social security and housing and other expenditures),
both at current prices, are reported by the Economic Commission for Latin America
and the Caribbean (ECLAC) Social Expenditure database. The economic variables
included in the model are the logged real per capita (GDPpc), the sum of exports
and imports as a percentage of GDP (trade), the stock of external debt to GNP
(external debt) from CEPALSTAT.7 The inﬂow of foreign direct investment (FDI)
(FDI inﬂows), the unemployment rate (unemployment) and the average interest paid
on new external debt commitments (interest payments on debt) are derived from
World Development Indicators (World Bank). Finally, the adjusted ﬁscal burden as
a percentage of GDP (ﬁscal burden) is reported by the Latin America and the
Caribbean Fiscal Burden Database, produced by the Inter-American Center of Tax
Administrations (CIAT) and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB).
Regarding demographic factors, we considered the percentage of the population
over age 65 reported by CEPALSTAT.
Under political determinants, we include several variables taken from Evelyne
Huber and John D. Stephens, Latin America and the Caribbean Political Dataset,
7
See the technical note on http://interwp.cepal.org/sisgen/SisGen_MuestraFicha.asp?indicador=134&id_
authoritarian regimes and semi-democracies, and as 1 for democracies. We also
incorporated government political orientation, taking into account the sum of the
proportion of seats in the lower house or constituent assembly held by right-wing
parties (right). With this information, we created a dummy variable with value 1, if
the right-wing parties held the majority of the seats and 0 otherwise. Finally, we
added time dummies to explicitly capture the inﬂuence of aggregate time series
trends. All variables will be calculated in levels and in differences (measured as
yearly changes) to capture long-term and short-term effects.
In Table 4 for Appendix, we present a table for descriptive statistics. We also
conducted a correlation analysis between explanatory variables using Spearman’s
rank correlation index.8 The highest correlation was observed between populations
over 65 and GDPpc (r = 0.71), while the growth of the population over 65 had in
general lower correlations with the rest of the variables. To discard multicollinearity
among independent variables, we will calculate the variance inﬂation factor (VIF)
after the OLS regression.

4 Methodology
There has been an intense debate about the appropriate models and estimation
methods to analyse the determinants of social expenditure (Dion 2006). The
literature has highlighted four main issues to take into account when estimating the
impact of the determinants of social spending:
1.
2.
3.
4.

Modelling in levels or in differences.
Correcting for serial correlation in the error terms.
Obtaining more efﬁcient estimators in the presence of contemporaneous
correlated errors across units and heteroskedasticity in panel data models.
Controlling for heterogeneities across observations and/or common time
shocks.

Regarding issue (1), there is a theoretical justiﬁcation for using levels or
differences depending on the expectations of how the independent variables
inﬂuence social spending. Avelino et al. (2005), Dion (2006), Huber et al. (2008)
and Lora (2009) estimate models in levels and put emphasis on long-term
relationships; whereas Snyder and Yackovlev (2000), Kaufman and Segura-Ubiergo
(2001) or Wibbels (2006) model in ﬁrst differences, obtaining information about
short-run effects. However, it is not only a theoretical choice since behind the
selection of the model there are econometric considerations that should be taken
into account. One of these is the existence of serial correlation in the error terms
(issue 2), which typically causes an underestimation of the standard errors
8

The Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient is sensitive to different data distributions, requiring normal
distribution and linear relationships between variables. Instead, we present Spearman‘s rank correlation
that assesses monotonic relationships, whether linear or not, not requiring normality. The correlation
frequently estimated using Prais–Winsten generalised linear regressions. An
alternative method is modelling a ﬁrst-order autoregressive panel data model,
adding lagged values of the dependent variable as regressor (Kaufman and SeguraUbiergo 2001; Avelino et al. 2005; Wibbels 2006; Dion 2006; Lora 2009). Beck and
Katz (1995) conducted simulations with both methods, recommending the lag
correction approach. However, it is still important to verify that the lagged
dependent variable effectively removes the serial correlation through a Lagrange
multiplier test (Kristensen and Wawro 2003).
An additional consideration is that models estimated in levels may show a
spurious correlation, since most economic time series are non-stationary in the mean
and show trend patterns (Granger and Newbold 1974). Cointegration techniques
provide an excellent framework to test for the existence of a stable long-run
equilibrium relationship between the non-stationary series (Engle and Granger
1987).9 This relationship can be described by an error-correction version (ECM) of
an autoregressive distributed lag approach (ARDL). Kaufman and Segura-Ubiergo
(2001) and Wibbels (2006) use an ARDL–ECM model to analyse the determinants
of social expenditure growth in Latin American countries, regressing this variable
against its own lag and other explanatory lagged variables in levels and differences
to capture the short- and long-term. The estimated error-correction term measures
the speed of short-run adjustment to long-run equilibrium after an exogenous shock.
For this to happen, the coefﬁcient needs to be statistically signiﬁcant and negative,
meaning that the error term is stationary, and therefore there is a cointegration
relationship between social expenditure and its determinants, where any deviation
from the equilibrium in the previous period will be adjusted at a rate given by this
error term. We may also interpret this equation as a conditional beta convergence
model, where the negative error-correction term is showing the presence of beta
convergence and the control variables are giving information about different
characteristics (levels and differences) that condition the convergence process to
country-speciﬁc long-term upper-level equilibriums.
Issue (3) points out the need to deal with the contemporaneous correlation of
errors across units—due to the common shocks in a given time period, and panel
heteroskedasticity—caused by time-invariant individual characteristics of each unit,
which cause ordinary least squares (OLS) estimators to be inefﬁcient. To avoid both
problems, and the ﬁrst-order serial correlation, Beck and Katz (1995) using Monte
Carlo methods propose an alternative estimator based on OLS with panel-corrected
standard errors (PCSE), a method widely used in political science research.
However, Kristensen and Wawro (2003) ﬁnd that PCSE are robust only when
individual effects are not taken into account in the model or not correlated with
explanatory variables. Reed and Webb (2010: 11) ﬁnd that the PCSE estimator does
not perform as well when the explanatory variables are highly persistent, the error
terms are serially correlated and the number of time periods is relatively short in
comparison with the number of cross-section units. Under these circumstances, the
9

Therefore, it is necessary to check the integration properties of the series using panel unit root tests,
hypotheses.
Issue (4) refers to the unobservable heterogeneity between units or individual
effects, which may cause omitted variable bias. In dynamic panel data models, if the
unit-speciﬁc effects are stochastic and they are correlated with the lagged dependent
variable, then the OLS estimator is inconsistent due to its correlation with the error
term (Bond 2002). Thus, before running the PCSE model, it is necessary to control
for time and individual effects (Kaufman and Segura-Ubiergo 2001; Wibbels 2006).
There is an additional issue that must be taken into account: the potential
endogeneity bias of some or all of the explanatory variables, causing the OLS
estimator to be biased and inconsistent. This is not at least only the case of the
lagged dependent variable in levels, but also those variables determined by others in
the system due to bidirectional causality. In this regard, we expect the presence of
causal dynamics between social expenditure and some of the explanatory variables.
For instance, Lampman (1984) enumerates a list of beneﬁts and costs of social
expenditures to economic growth due to the positive effects on output of education,
health, and the economic security of the labour force; macroeconomic stabilization;
¨
labour supply effects; productivity effects and resource reallocation effects. Gorg
et al. (2008) also ﬁnd a positive impact of social welfare expenditure on FDI
inﬂows, conﬁrming the view that multinationals value the contribution of social
expenditure on the increase of education and health standards, the development and
maintenance of a social fabric and the reduction of political unrest. They also
guarantee the cooperation of the unions and increase workers’ and ﬁrms’ incentives
to invest in the industry. These relationships should be taken into account before
carrying out any empirical analysis.
A common approach to control for endogeneity is through instrumental variables,
where the generalised method-of-moments (GMM) developed by Hansen (1982)
has been the most widely used procedure to obtain efﬁcient estimators in the
presence of heteroskedasticity (Baum et al. 2003). Lora and Olivera (2009) and Lora
(2009) apply a ﬁrst-difference GMM estimator to analyse the vulnerability of social
expenditure to several ﬁscal variables, using as instruments the lagged levels of the
explanatory variables. However, as Blundell and Bond (2000) point out, when the
lagged values of the series used as instruments are weakly correlated with the ﬁrst
differences of the endogenous variables, then the ﬁrst-differenced GMM estimator
results are expected to be downward biased in the direction within the groups. This
problem is even more severe when series are highly persistent and the time period is
small (Yasar et al. 2006). For this reason, Arellano and Bover (1995) and Blundell
and Bond (1998, 2000) recommend the use of the system GMM estimator, which
combines the moment conditions deﬁned for the ﬁrst-differenced equation with the
moment conditions deﬁned for the level equation. It uses the lagged levels of the
series as instruments for the ﬁrst-difference equation and the lagged ﬁrst-differences
of the series as instruments for the level equation. Blundell and Bond (1998) showed
that the system GMM estimator results in consistent and efﬁcient parameter
Following the methodological issues discussed above, we need to ﬁrst verify
that the panel model represents a structural long-run equilibrium relationship
and not a spurious regression. Estimates from non-stationary series can reveal
this problem, unless they are cointegrated. The non-stationarity of the variables
will be tested by panel unit root tests, since univariate unit root tests such as
Dickey–Fuller or augmented Dickey–Fuller can suffer from poor power
properties in small samples (Pierse and Shell 1995). We speciﬁcally use Im
et al. (2003) and Fisher-type (Choi 2001) panel unit root tests. All tests were
conducted including constant and linear time trend, except for unemployment
and political variables that do not show a time trend. These results are reported
in Table 1.
Both tests support the hypothesis of a unit root for most of the level variables
demonstrating that the series are not stationary except for democracy, which is
stationary or integrated of order zero, I(0). The variables in ﬁrst differences are all
stationary, indicating that they are integrated of order one or I(1).
Next, we examine the long-run relationship between social expenditure and its
determinants estimating a panel error-correction model (ECM) to ﬁnd cointegration
relationships between the I(1) and I(0) variables of the model.
We start with an autoregressive distributed lag model ARDL (1,1) transformed
into an error-correction model (ECM) presented by Beck and Kats (1996: 11).
Dyit ¼ a0 þ Dxit b1k þ hðyitÀ1 À xitÀ1 ck Þ þ vit ;

ð1Þ

We can rewrite this model in a more intuitive way following Zivot (1994) and
Kaufman and Segura-Ubiergo (2001):
Dyit ¼ a0 þ hyitÀ1 þ Dxit b1k þ xitÀ1 b2k þ vit ;

ð2Þ

with b2k ¼ Àðhck Þ and vit ¼ gi þ uit where yit is social expenditure as a share of
GDP of country i in period t. Dyit is its growth. yitÀ1 is the lagged dependent variable
that corrects for autocorrelation in the error terms. Dxit is the growth of economic
and political variables. xitÀ1 is a vector of lagged economic and political variables.
vit is the composite error term that includes gi , the unobservable time-invariant
individual effects, correlated with the explanatory variables, but not with their
differences, and uit is the error term assumed to be i.i.d. (0, r2 ). b1k represents the
u
short-term impact of xit on yit , while h represents the long-term impact between both
variables, showing the rate at which xit and yit return to their long-term equilibrium
relationship (Beck and Katz 1996: 11). This coefﬁcient is precisely the error-correction term that measures the speed of short-run adjustment to long-run equilibrium
after an exogenous shock. If h is signiﬁcant and negative and the disturbance is
stationary, there is a long-term or cointegration relationship between social
expenditure and its regressors, where any deviation from the equilibrium in the
previous period will be adjusted at rate h10 . This result may also be interpreted as

results (see Table 2).10 Columns 1 and 2 show OLS and ﬁxed effect coefﬁcients. We
know that the OLS estimates are biased upwards, because the lagged dependent
variable is positively correlated with the ﬁxed component of the error term (gi ).
Conversely, the ﬁxed effect coefﬁcients are biased downwards due to the negative
sign on utÀ1 in the transformed error term. Given the opposite directions of bias in
both estimates, any consistent estimate should lie between these values (Yasar et al.
2006). The PCSE estimator controls for the heteroskedastic and contemporaneous
correlation in the error term across units. However, it may not perform as well in the
presence of persistent explanatory variables, serially correlated errors, and relatively
short time periods in comparison with the number of cross-section units (Reed and
Webb 2010). We ﬁnally present the ﬁrst difference generalised method-of-moments
estimator (GMMdif) and the system GMM estimator (GMMsys), setting out the
endogenous variables with their lagged levels in the ﬁrst case and the lagged levels
and differences in the second. With respect to endogeneity, the lagged dependent
variable (yitÀ1 ) is clearly endogenous (remember that Dyit ¼ yit À yitÀ1 ). We will
also assume that GDPpc, FDI inﬂows and ﬁscal variables are endogenous due to
reverse causality.11
Table 2 shows the relationship between social expenditure growth and its
determinants using different estimation procedures. In all cases, the coefﬁcients of
the lagged levels of social spending are signiﬁcant and negative. This indicates a
statistically signiﬁcant cointegrating relationship between social expenditures and
its determinants, showing a long-run equilibrium relationship between them. Any
unanticipated shock that changes the equilibrium path would be restored in the
future periods at speeds that range between 3.3% per year for the OLS regression
and 27% per year in the ﬁxed effect (FE) regression. But as we have already
mentioned, the OLS estimates are upward biased, while FE regression is downward
biased. The third column presents the PCSE regression12 which shows estimates
very close to those of OLS, presenting the same direction of bias (Chen et al. 2005).
Then we take into account the endogeneity of the lagged dependent variables among
the regressors together with some economic and ﬁscal variables (GDPpc, ﬁscal
burden, external debt and FDI inﬂow), using the ﬁrst-differenced GMM and the
system GMM estimators. The Arellano and Bond (1991) test for autocorrelation
conﬁrms that both GMM estimators are consistent, ﬁnding ﬁrst-order serial
correlation in the error term of the ﬁrst differences equation, but not second-order
serial correlation. The validity of the set of instruments consisting of the lagged
levels of the endogenous variables in t - 2 and earlier periods is tested by the
Sargan test of overidentifying restrictions.13 The ﬁrst-differenced GMM instruments

We estimated different System GMM regression in order to check the robustness of the independent
variables. Results were consistent with the estimates presented in Table 2. The results are available on
request.

We assume that social expenditures may affect and be affected by GDPpc, FDI inﬂows, ﬁscal burden
and external debt.

We used the same speciﬁcation for the PCSE model as Kaufman and Segura-Ubiergo (2001).

variables are not independent from the error term. In addition, the GMM in ﬁrst
differences error-correction coefﬁcient lies outside the conﬁdence interval given by
OLS and FE estimates, conﬁrming that it suffers from large ﬁnite sample bias
caused by weak instruments. The ﬁfth column presents the system GMM estimates.
The validity of both sets of instruments, lagged levels dated t - 2 and earlier in the
ﬁrst-differenced equations and lagged ﬁrst differences dated t - 2 and earlier in the
levels equations, is not rejected by the Sargan test of overidentifying restrictions and
the differenced Sargan test, respectively. In addition, the error-correction coefﬁcient
lies in between the OLS and FE estimates, which means that these coefﬁcients are
more efﬁcient and unbiased than the former speciﬁcations.
Focussing on the system GMM estimator, the error-correction term is - 0.098
meaning that the system adjusts towards long-run or steady state equilibrium at
almost 10% annually. Aggregate social expenditure will adjust to any discrepancy
between social expenditure and its determinants in previous periods at this speed.
This coefﬁcient also shows the presence of diminishing marginal returns in social
expenditures, which means that countries with a higher level of social spending tend
to have lower growth rates in this variable. These results support the existence of
beta convergence across Latin American countries. The next two columns report
estimates for the Washington Consensus period (1990–2000) and the postWashington Consensus period (2000–2012). We observe that the convergence
speed to steady state was higher in the ﬁrst period.15
To determine whether we are in the presence of absolute beta convergence
towards a common steady state or conditional beta convergence towards countryspeciﬁc steady states, we need to test for the presence of sigma convergence,
calculated as the coefﬁcient of variation of social expenditure growth. There would
be absolute beta convergence, if economies have diminishing returns in the
expansion of social expenditure and, therefore, a downward trend in the coefﬁcient
of variation. On the other hand, if we ﬁnd stationarity in the series with coefﬁcient
of variation far different from zero, we could conclude that there is conditional beta
convergence of each country towards its own steady state. Therefore, we look upon
convergence as a stochastic process (Bernard and Durlauf 1996) and test the
stationarity of the series by conducting an augmented Dickey–Fuller unit root test
and a Phillips–Perron test (Table 3).
As we can observe in Table 3, In all cases, we reject the null hypothesis of a unit
root, conﬁrming that the series are stationary with mean different from zero,
demonstrating that differences in countries’ growth rates are steady. This means that
each country has converged to its own steady state conditioned by structural

The null hypothesis of the Sargan test is that there is independence between the set of instruments and
the error terms. Thus, for instruments to be valid, failure to reject the null hypothesis is needed.

In Appendix 3 we include a table with the GMM system estimates of the economic, demographic and
political determinants for the main categories of social expenditure (education, health, social security and
housing and other expenditures). The coefﬁcients of the lagged levels of all social expenditure categories

statistical signiﬁcance at the 1, 5 and 10% levels, respectively for stationary variables

differences, given by the statistically signiﬁcant determinants of social spending that
are analysed below.
Looking at the period as a whole (1990–2012), the factors that explained the
differences in social expenditure efforts between Latin American countries were:
ﬁscal burden and FDI growth both with a positive effect, while trade growth, the
level of external debt, the increase of interest payments on debt, the level of
democracy and its growth had a negative effect. However, when we distinguish
between the two sub-periods, we ﬁnd interesting contrasts. During the Washington
Consensus period (1990–2000), differences in social spending across Latin
American countries were mainly related to structural ﬁscal factors. As column 8
from Table 2 shows, those countries with a higher ﬁscal burden and lower external
debt experienced higher social expenditure growth, mainly in health programs in the
ﬁrst case and education spending in the second (see Table 6 in Appendix). Interest
payments on external debt had a negative effect on social expenditure, although its
level of signiﬁcance is below 10% (p value = 0.199). If we take this as valid, it
means that they may have caused a reduction social expenditure as highlighted by
Hunter and Brown (2000), Dion (2006) and Lora (2009). In Table 6 in Appendix,
we see that they impacted negatively on health expenditure during the ﬁrst period
1990–2000. This reﬂects the fact that during these years, Latin American
governments’ social spending decisions were clearly inﬂuenced by the ﬁscal
discipline imposed by the Washington Consensus and that the countries that could
increase their social expenditures more were those with a greater ﬁscal burden and
lower external debt. Other variables that affected social expenditure during this
period were economic growth, ﬁnding evidence for pro-cyclical effects and
validating the Wagner’s law of increasing state activity accompanying economic
growth. Those countries that increased their foreign direct investment inﬂows
tended to boost their social effort which gives support to the compensation
hypothesis, where higher international competition could have encouraged governments to increase social spending to boost workers’ productivity through greater
investment mainly in education, with a view to enhancing labour productivity. This
is not surprising as during this period, there was a move towards greater investment
democratic governments in Latin America have tended to spend more on education
programs, and right-wing governments spent less than centre and left-wing
governments, indicating that they were more committed to the prescriptions of the
Washington Consensus with respect to ﬁscal austerity.
As we have indicated, from 2000 Latin American countries were progressively
moving away from the guidelines of the Washington Consensus and, as our results
suggests, this altered Latin American governments’ social spending decisions,
which changed the factors that explained the differences in social spending growth
between Latin American countries. Results from column 7 clearly reﬂects a change
in social spending determinants between the two periods, showing that during the
post-Washington Consensus period, the evolution of social spending was mainly
determined by short-term or conjunctural variables rather than by countries’ ﬁscal
discipline. The growth of GDP per capita, ﬁscal burden, trade and FDI inﬂow were
the variables that explained the differences in the evolution of social spending.
Countries with a higher ﬁscal burden growth tended to spend more on social
programs, mainly through social security investments (see Table 6 in Appendix).
Countries also applied counter-cyclical measures to stabilize their social expenditures, as we found a negative and signiﬁcant effect between GDP per capita growth
and social spending17 (mainly in health expenditure). The 2008 international
ﬁnancial crisis contributed to the intensiﬁcation of this process. Additionally, the
increase in trade openness had a signiﬁcant negative impact on social expenditure
growth, negatively affecting education investments. This gives support to the
efﬁciency hypothesis during the post-Washington Consensus period, probably due
to claims of exporters exposed to increases in international competition as
evidenced by Kaufman and Segura-Ubiergo (2001) and Wibbels (2006). Finally,
governments facing higher FDI inﬂows tended to increase their social expenditures.
Other factors that affected social policy during these years were unemployment and
democracy, both with a negative impact on social expenditure growth. In the ﬁrst
case, higher unemployment is associated with lower tax income affecting negatively
the resources for social policies. This may have led to cuts in education spending to
offset the reduction in ﬁscal income. In the second case, the negative coefﬁcient on
democracy means that more authoritarian governments in Latin America have
tended to spend more on social policies, affecting mainly social security
investments (see Table 6 in Appendix). Avelino et al. (2005) observe that countries
in transition towards democracy may be able to increase social spending for the
poor, because of the strength of the voting power of this population sector.
Authoritarian regimes may take more drastic decisions for or against social
spending than democratic regimes, due to the absence of ‘‘veto points’’
characterised by Immergut (1990) or ‘‘veto players’’ postulated by Tsebelis
(2002), provided by different political systems to interest groups, not allowing them
16
In Appendix 3 we observe that FDI inﬂows positively affected education expenditures both in the short
term and long-term.
17
The effects of GDP per capita in both periods have a similar value but opposite signs, explaining why
more attention to social policies, promoting health expenditures (see Table 6 in
Appendix). This conﬁrms the results of Ruggie (1983), Diamant and Katzenstein
(1986) and Rodrik (1997) but goes against those of Ross (1997, 2000) and
Armingeon et al. (2001), for whom left-wing parties have a greater preoccupation
with the protection of workers through social security expenditure.

6 Conclusions
In this paper, we have examined economic, demographic and political determinants
of social spending in Latin America during the period 1990–2012 in 17 Latin
American countries. Special attention was paid to the evaluation of convergence
towards a common upper-bounded steady state (absolute beta convergence) or to
speciﬁc steady states conditioned by their country-speciﬁc determinants (conditional beta convergence). We also considered two sub-periods, the Washington
Consensus period (1990–2000) and the post-Washington Consensus period
(2001–2012), showing that those determinants may have affected the long-term
equilibrium of social expenditures in different ways.
For this purpose, we analysed an extensive list of determinants highlighted in the
literature, which may provide potential explanations about the different levels of
social expenditure in Latin American countries. We are aware that this list is not
exhaustive and that it would be important to consider other variables in future
research depending on the topic analysed.
In this context, we applied a dynamic panel data error-correction model to
capture short- and long-term relationships between social expenditure and the set of
economic, demographic and political variables. To control for the endogeneity bias
caused by bidirectional causality between social expenditure growth and some of its
determinants, we used GMM estimators. We treated as endogenous the lagged level
of social expenditures. We also assumed that GDP per capita, ﬁscal burden, external
debt and FDI inﬂow may have a reverse causality with social expenditures, i.e. that
those variables may affect and be affected by social expenditures. Before running all
the regressions, it was necessary to check for the order of integration of the series, to
discard the possibility of spurious results due to common trends between the
dependent and the independent variables. We found that all variables were
integrated of order 1, except for democracy that was already stationary in levels or
integrated of order 0. Concerning the regression procedure, we demonstrated that
GMM system estimators were more efﬁcient and unbiased than other estimators
proposed in the literature (OLS, ﬁxed effects, panel correction standard errors and
ﬁrst-differenced GMM). The system GMM regression found strong evidence of
cointegration between social spending and its determinants, which suggests that
there is a long-term relationship between those I(1) variables during the whole
period analysed. This analysis also shows diminishing returns in social expenditures, conﬁrming the hypothesis of conditional convergence toward country-speciﬁc
equilibriums, as disparities across countries did not disappear in the long run. That
them to a long-term equilibrium which is different for each country. It also means
that any unanticipated shock that changes the equilibrium path will be restored in
future periods at the speed given by the error-correction term.
Several variables are responsible for the differences in social security equilibriums across Latin American countries. During the Washington Consensus period
(1990–2000), countries appear to have reacted more evenly in their social
expenditure policies, relating their investment decisions to ﬁscal structural factors.
As a consequence, differences across Latin American countries reduced rapidly,
thereby possibly resulting in an absolute beta convergence toward a common social
expenditure steady state. However, the poor outcomes of the Consensus recipe in
terms of economic growth and inequality reduction drove Latin American
governments to progressively abandon this ﬁscal orthodoxy. After 2000, each
country tended to adapt its policies into a strategy of self-discovery, exploiting their
own economic and political characteristics and constraints (Rodrik 2005). During
the post-Washington Consensus period (2000–2012), countries reacted proactively
to promote an endogenous growth through short-term measures. In this respect, we
found that the pace of convergence to a long-term equilibrium reduced signiﬁcantly
with respect to the ﬁrst period. Also the determinants of social expenditure policy
changed and were now more related to short- term or conjunctural factors like ﬁscal
burden growth, GDP per capita growth, FDI inﬂow growth and international trade
growth.
Other determinants were stable during the whole period (1990–2012). Countries
seem to have applied a compensation hypothesis related to FDI inﬂows,
incrementing their social expenditures to boost workers’ productivity to overcome
greater volatility and risk as evidenced by Kaufman and Segura-Ubiergo (2001).
However, trade openness has negatively affected social expenditures in the second
period, mainly in education investment. With respect to GDP per capita growth, it
was an important short-term determinant of social expenditure, having a similar
impact in both periods but with opposite signs. During the ﬁrst period, countries
reacted positively to economic growth showing that social policy was pro-cyclical,
while in the second period it seems to be counter-cyclical. The economic downturn
after the 2008 international ﬁnancial crisis deepened this change, driving
governments to apply discretionary stabilization policies to counteract the negative
impact on employment, economic activity and social vulnerability.
The political variables show that during the ﬁrst period, democratic left-wing
governments tended to have a long-term positive impact on social expenditure,
speciﬁcally on education and health. By contrast, during the second period
authoritarian regimes, regardless of their ideological orientation, they may have
taken more drastic decisions in favour of social spending than in the case of
democratic regimes.
In conclusion, we have observed that structural and conjunctural differences
between Latin American countries explain the differences in the evolution of social
expenditure in the region. We do not ﬁnd a natural process of saturation and
convergence to a common upper-limit welfare state long-term equilibrium as stated
reduction in dispersion across countries indicates that Latin American countries are
not converging towards a common upper-bounded steady state on social effort.
Instead, these results must be interpreted as evidence of conditional beta
convergence, where each country is moving towards its own steady state in social
effort, which is consistent with the persistence of disparities across countries. The
disparities across countries in social expenditure growth are determined by
economic, demographic and political differences across Latin American countries.

Abstract This paper examines the determinants of social spending in Latin
America during the period 1990–2012 and how they differed between the years of
the Washington Consensus (1990–2000) and the period that followed (2001–2012).
Special attention is also paid to the evaluation of convergence towards a common
upper-bounded steady state (absolute beta convergence) or to speciﬁc steady states
conditioned by their country’s speciﬁc determinants (conditional beta convergence).
We estimate a panel error-correction version of an autoregressive distributed lag
model to identify the long-term relationships between social expenditure and its
determinants. Generalised methods of moments estimators are used to control the
endogeneity of the regressors. Results indicate that Latin American social spending
follows a conditional beta convergence process over the Washington consensus
period that was mainly driven by structural differences in ﬁscal burdens and external
debt, while during the second period it was explained by conjunctural differences in
the ﬁscal burden, GDP per capita and the growth of trade and capital openness.

The reduction of poverty and inequality as well as the promotion of human
performance and capabilities has become of increasing interest in the economic
development debate (Sen 1982). At the same time, improving education, health,
sanitation and other social services has become a priority for the governments
´
(Suescun 2007). In this context, two separate questions have attracted the interest of
policymakers and researchers. The ﬁrst is related to the effectiveness of social
policies in terms of providing access to education among low-income groups, the
creation of employment opportunities or the social protection of certain excluded
population sectors (United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and
the Caribbean 2012). The second deals with the analysis of the determinants of
social expenditure levels and their growth, as they have a direct inﬂuence on human
development. This paper belongs to the second group of studies, as it examines the
factors that inﬂuence convergence in social spending across 17 Latin American
countries for the period 1990–2012.1
A large number of studies have attributed the restructuring of the welfare state
to the growth of globalisation. On one hand, there is the pessimistic view that
welfare provision would converge to a new low-level social expenditure
equilibrium, because of globalisation and increasing economic vulnerability, and
capital outﬂows, irrespective of ideology (Strange 1996; Friedman 2000; Swank
2001). On the optimistic side, Boix (1998) stresses that globalisation allows leftist
parties to expand their activities in human capital formation, expanding the
welfare state more than right-wing parties do. Consequently, divergence in welfare
effort is more likely to continue (Kitter and Obinger 2003). Pierson (2001)
supports a third view, called ‘‘the politics of blame avoidance’’, since efforts to
scale down the welfare state involve high risks of electoral punishment. Therefore,
he argues that partisan differences will disappear, and governments will attempt to
renegotiate and restructure the welfare state under pressure from international
competition. In the long run, however, welfare states may become more like each
other, since all the nations are anxious to make their welfare systems more
competitive, although the ways in which these adjustments are accomplished differ
from country to country (Kitter and Obinger 2003, 22), depending on their
institutional legacies. Kitter and Obinger (2003), following Flora (1986), describe
a natural process of saturation and therefore convergence to the long-term
equilibrium of an upper-limit welfare state. They accept the catch-up hypothesis
across OECD countries, where the social effort path is dependent upon past
spending levels. Behind this idea lies the assumption of an absolute beta

The ECLAC dataset covers the period 1990-2014. However, we have excluded from the analysis the
four Caribbean countries for which the ECLAC does not provide information (Cuba, Jamaica, the
Dominican Republic and Trinidad and Tobago). We also decided to exclude the data for 2013 and 2014,
because few countries have provided information about social expenditures (Argentina, Chile, Costa

¨
Puss et al. (2005) ﬁnd the presence of statistically signiﬁcant beta convergence
for total and per capita social expenditure at purchasing power parity (PPP) as a
share of GDP for EU countries over the period 1993–2000. Starke et al. (2008) ﬁnd
beta convergence in 21 OECD countries from 1980 to 2003, which reveals an
upward trend over time. Even so, they observe a quite modest reduction of
disparities between countries, i.e. a lack of sigma convergence. For Latin American
countries, Lora (2009) gives an interpretation of the convergence coefﬁcient stating
that social expenditure has a certain inertia.
We agree in part with the catch-up or beta convergence hypothesis to an upperlimit social expenditure equilibrium. However, the discrete reduction in dispersion
across countries (see Table 5 in Appendix) indicates that perhaps Latin American
countries are not converging to a common upper-bounded steady state in social
effort. Instead, these results might be interpreted as evidence of conditional beta
convergence, where each country is converging to its own steady state in social
effort, which is consistent with the persistence of disparities across countries. In
social expenditure growth, these are determined by economic, demographic and
political differences across Latin American countries. In this regard, it is important
to note that social spending as a state policy in Latin America during 1990–2012 can
be divided into two clearly differentiated periods that could have affected the
inﬂuence of its economic, demographic and political determinants.
During the ﬁrst period, covering the years 1990–2000, with the implementation
of the Washington consensus, most Latin American governments carried out deep
structural and institutional reforms that were mainly focused on budgetary
discipline. These reforms encompassed policies in areas such as macroeconomic
stabilization, economic opportunities with respect to both trade and investment, and
the expansion of market forces within the domestic economy. During these years,
the role of the state was weakened in Latin American countries and social spending
was highly conditioned to ﬁscal discipline and debt repayment. Leaving aside the
macroeconomic consequences of the Washington consensus, its logic was
progressively abandoned after 2000 (Lora 2001) and the social agenda occupied a
much more prominent place during these years. In general terms, the Washington
post-consensus favoured the defence of the complementary (and not exclusive)
relationship between the market and the state, the strengthening of institutional
capacities, the implementation of reforms focused on social issues and the recovery
of public activities as a development factor. Consequently, the role of the States in
the provision of social services was strengthened, incorporating in their social
policies concepts such as the protection of rights, full citizenship and social
inclusion (Tomber 2016). Efforts to extend population coverage in social protection,
with a better quality and a wider variety of social services were central to almost all
countries in the region (Cecchini et al. 2014). To achieve these targets, ﬁscal
2

However, other studies from developing countries, have found that globalisation is not powerful
enough to change the national policies, not contributing them to converge toward a long-term common
expansion of opportunities for the poor (Kuczynski and Williamson 2003). In
addition, the majority of Latin American and Caribbean states began to undertake
counter-cyclical measures to stabilize employment, economic activity and social
vulnerability. The 2008 ﬁnancial crisis deepened this change of direction (United
Nations Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean 2011).
Roughly, we can state that during this period, governments paid less attention to
structural ﬁscal factors and the evolution of social expenditure was more linked to
conjunctural factors.
Given that the role of the state was clearly different between these periods, it is
likely that the economic, demographic and political factors that inﬂuence social
spending growth also differed. The aim of this study is precisely to evaluate which
determinants explained differences in social spending growth during the years of the
Washington Consensus (1990–2000) and the period that followed (2001–2012).
Additionally, we will analyse whether social spending in Latin America converged
towards a common upper-bounded steady state or to speciﬁc steady states
conditioned by their country-speciﬁc characteristics. The rest of the paper is
organised as follows: Sect. 2 reviews the literature on the determinants of social
spending in developing and transition countries. Section 3 addresses the main
methodological issues highlighted in the literature and presents the methodology
used in this paper. Section 4 displays and discusses the results on the determinants
of social spending and its categories. Finally, we conclude in Sect. 4.

2 Determinants of social spending
Studies on the determinants of social spending have increased since the late 1970s,
coinciding with the implementation of social policy reforms carried out in
developed countries to strengthen their welfare states (Kittel and Obinger 2003).
Several determinants of social spending were considered, such as the ideological
orientation of governments, integration into global markets or the degree of ﬁscal
decentralisation.3 Since 2000, there has been a rising interest in analysing these
issues in developing and transition economies, given the dynamics and peculiarities
of their economic, political, institutional and demographic characteristics. In what
follows, we review the literature on the economic, demographic and political
determinants of social spending that focuses on Latin American countries.
2.1 Economic determinants of social spending
From an economic perspective, the literature has focused on globalisation as one of
the main determinants of social spending (Kaufman and Segura-Ubiergo 2001;
Avelino et al. 2005; Dreher et al. 2008; Leibrecht et al. 2011). There are two
opposing views on the effect of globalisation on social spending: the efﬁciency
hypothesis and the compensation hypothesis (Garrett 1998; Garrett and Nickerson
3

pressure on governments that favours market interests over social issues, thus
reducing social expenditures.4 Kaufman and Segura-Ubiergo (2001) ﬁnd that there
is a negative impact of trade openness on the various types of social expenditure.
Garrett and Mitchell (2001) in their study of 18 OECD countries also ﬁnd that trade
openness reduces social security spending.
On the other hand, the compensation hypothesis argues that integration into
international markets would encourage governments to increase social spending to
boost workers’ productivity and overcome greater volatility and risk. Kaufman and
Segura-Ubiergo (2001: 557) observe that the increase in international competition
may cause ‘‘social dislocation, uncertainty and unequal distributive effects’’.
Bearing in mind that public investment in human capital represents a public good,
the business sector may also demand greater investment in education, which should
help them to enhance productivity and thereby improve their competitiveness. In
this scenario, governments would see beneﬁt in increasing social expenditure to
avoid political instability, thus redistributing the risks of the increased openness of
the economy. Furthermore, ﬁnancial openness should theoretically follow a similar
logic, as businesses conducting foreign direct investment value the contribution of
¨
social expenditure through the increase in education and health standards (Gorg
et al. 2008). Several studies have found a positive effect on trade and capital
openness and public spending (Hicks and Swank 1992; Huber et al. 1993; Quinn
1997; Bernauer and Achini 2000; Swank 2001; Balle and Vaidya 2002; Bretschger
and Hettich 2002 as cited by Gemmell et al. 2008). Kaufman and Segura-Ubiergo
(2001) also ﬁnd a positive effect of capital openness in health and education
expenditures. There are also those who ﬁnd no conclusive evidence in favour of
either hypothesis. Avelino et al. (2005) observe that ﬁnancial openness puts no
constraint on government spending.5 Dreher (2006), using an index of globalisation
that includes economic, political and social integration over 30 OECD countries,
ﬁnds that globalisation does not inﬂuence government spending and social
expenditures.
Another factor that has been less analysed as a determinant of social expenditure
is public sector income. Few empirical studies have examined the role of revenue
constraints as a determinant of social spending (Garrett 1998; Kato 2003; Lindert
2004; Haggard and Kaufman 2004). They have argued that the fragile ability of
ﬁscal institutions to collect taxes could be responsible for Latin America’s low
social expenditures during the 1980s and 1990s (Haggard and Kaufman 2004). This
4

In this regard, Wibbels (2006) indicates that the negative relationship between openness and social
spending found in developing countries is caused by their dependent position in global markets. This is
mainly due to prices of primary products, which tend to be more volatile, causing sharp changes in
business cycles in developing countries. Volatility limits governments from obtaining funding from
international markets during times of crisis and any ensuing production shocks, thereby reducing their
spending capacity.

5

Moreover, several studies suggest that the compensation and the efﬁciency effects may differ
depending on the type of social expenditure. Dion (2000, 2006) for developing countries and Kaufman
and Segura-Ubiergo (2001) and Avelino et al. (2005) for Latin America, ﬁnd that trade liberalisation has a
positive impact on education and health expenditures, because it encourages governments to improve
region (Aldunate and Martner 2006). Governments with lower revenues and higher
commitments to social services are more likely to face greater constraints on social
spending, even under strong pressure from the beneﬁciaries (Haggard and Kaufman
2004). In addition, Gupta (1967) and Nomura (1991, 1995) have observed that the
rise in revenue collection goes hand in hand with economic growth. Burgess and
Stern (1993), Tanzi and Zee (2000), Fox and Gurley (2005) ﬁnd a positive
correlation between tax revenue and GDP per capita. This evidence ties in with
Wagner’s law of increasing state activity (Bird 1971), which states that government
activities grow with the economic development of a country over time, through
increasing public expenditure to satisfy social needs. Consequently, the ﬁscal
burden and its connection with GDP per capita and its growth might also explain the
dynamics of social spending.
Public indebtedness is another economic factor related to the ﬁscal burden that
could inﬂuence social expenditures. Lora and Olivera (2007) and Lora (2009) ﬁnd
that excessive debt ratio and high interest payments on debt have a restrictive effect
on social expenditure. This effect has been found to be greater in Latin American
countries which constitutes a limitation not only for social security, but also for
education and health spending (Hunter and Brown 2000; Dion 2006). Lora and
Olivera (2007) observe that non-compliance with debt servicing can raise social
spending in the short run, particularly in Latin America. However, Lora (2009) ﬁnds
the opposite for the same region, except for highly indebted countries.
There are additional economic determinants of social expenditure highlighted in
the literature. A rising unemployment rate is likely to increase social spending
(Snyder and Yackovlev 2000; Kittel and Obinger 2003; Avelino et al. 2005).
Avelino et al. (2005) argue that even if there are few unemployment programs in
Latin America, there should be a positive relationship between unemployment and
social spending, due to governments’ efforts to counteract the negative effects of
any crisis and to promote employment generation.
2.2 Demographic determinants of social spending
Social spending is also determined by the demographic structure of a country. For
instance, growth in the ageing population increases social expenditure, mostly on
health and retirement pensions, forcing many governments to restructure their social
policy due to ﬁnancial constraints. Lindert (1994, 1996) shows that an increase in
the size of the population aged over 65 in OECD countries has a strong positive
effect on social spending, especially on pensions, and negative effects on education.
Gonzalez-Eiras et al. (2007: 24) apply an overlapping-generational model to
disaggregated social spending in the United States. They observe that the
demographic transition towards an older society in the United States led to a
‘‘reallocation of government spending from productive public education to
unproductive intergenerational transfers’’. In contrast, the presence of a high
percentage of young people (under 15) raises spending on education and health and
lower social security spending. In this sense, Huber et al. (2008) ﬁnd that health
population.
2.3 Political determinants of social spending
The third set of factors that inﬂuence spending on social programs is linked to
political organisations and institutions. There is a vast body of literature that regards
the political ideology of governments to have effects on social spending. Ruggie
(1983), Diamant and Katzenstein (1986) and Rodrik (1997) emphasise that
economic liberalism has been accompanied by an increase in social protection, not
only in industrialised countries but also on a global scale, which rejects the
efﬁciency hypothesis. According to Ross (1997, 2000) and Armingeon et al. (2001),
right-wing parties are less likely to pursue policies that sustain the welfare state, due
to their lower concern for workers’ protection. Kitschelt and Herbert (2001)
maintain that centre and right-wing parties are more reluctant to cut beneﬁts or to
impose ﬁscal austerity in times of economic recession.6 Roberts (2002) and
Kitschelt et al. (2010) argue that left-wing parties do not have a signiﬁcant inﬂuence
on social policy, due to their low levels of institutionalization and the lack of
substantive differences between left and right party labels, when compared to those
in the developed countries (Niedzwiecki and Sara 2015). Hicks and EspingAndersen (2003) present a comparative analysis of the role of left- and right-wing
parties in the development of the welfare state. They observe that the correlations
between social expenditure and the political orientation of the parties seem to be
period-sensitive. In this regard, during the 1960s until the early 1980s, they ﬁnd a
positive effect of left-wing parties on social expenditure, but from that moment, the
differences between parties of the left and right tend to disappear, due to
retrenchments in the levels of social policies by left-wing governments since then.
Another related issue is whether authoritarian or democratic regimes have
different levels of social spending. Some authors believe that democratic regimes
have higher social costs due to high electoral risks. In this sense, Avelino et al.
(2005) observe that countries in transition towards democracy may be able to
increase social spending for the poor, because of the strength of this population
sector’s voting power. Regarding social spending categories, Kaufman and SeguraUbiergo (2001) and Avelino et al. (2005) ﬁnd a strong positive association between
democracy and education spending in Latin America, as governments attempt to
attract more voters through proper educational programs, or because there is a high
percentage of young people in the population, which makes it more attractive for the
government to spend on education. However, Avelino et al. (2005) do not ﬁnd any
signiﬁcant correlation between democracy and spending on health and social
security. Huber et al. (2008) indicate that, regardless of their ideological orientation,
democratic regimes have a long-term positive impact on both social security
spending and health/education spending. Conversely, highly repressive authoritarian
governments have negative effects on health and education expenditures, but they
6

See Kittel and Obinger (2003) for an extensive review of partisan politics and political institutions as
with the median voter theorem (Boix 1998; Dion 2006), which states that
democratic regimes have higher social expenditures because they take into account
the whole population in their welfare decisions and therefore the income of the
median voter is lower than it would be in authoritarian regimes, where social
spending would be targeted at the smaller group of supporters who beneﬁt from the
regime. On the other hand, authoritarian regimes may take more drastic decisions
for or against social spending than in the case of democratic regimes, due to the
absence of ‘‘veto points’’ characterised by Immergut (1990) or ‘‘veto players’’
postulated by Tsebelis (2002), provided by different political systems to interest
groups by not allowing them to gain veto power to block political reforms.
In summary, we have described an extensive list of determinants highlighted in
the literature, which may provide potential explanations about the different levels of
social expenditure in Latin American countries and their growth. We are aware that
this list is not exhaustive and that there are other variables that would be important
to consider, depending on the objectives of the research topic. For the purposes of
our study, we believe that we have covered a wide range of determinants of social
expenditures that will help us to present differences among Latin American
countries during the two periods under consideration.
The next section examines the economic, demographic and political determinants
of social spending, listing the data sources. Subsequently, some methodological
aspects are considered to properly evaluate their impact on social spending.

3 Data and variables
The measures of aggregate social expenditure as a percentage of GDP and its
categories (health, education, social security and housing and other expenditures),
both at current prices, are reported by the Economic Commission for Latin America
and the Caribbean (ECLAC) Social Expenditure database. The economic variables
included in the model are the logged real per capita (GDPpc), the sum of exports
and imports as a percentage of GDP (trade), the stock of external debt to GNP
(external debt) from CEPALSTAT.7 The inﬂow of foreign direct investment (FDI)
(FDI inﬂows), the unemployment rate (unemployment) and the average interest paid
on new external debt commitments (interest payments on debt) are derived from
World Development Indicators (World Bank). Finally, the adjusted ﬁscal burden as
a percentage of GDP (ﬁscal burden) is reported by the Latin America and the
Caribbean Fiscal Burden Database, produced by the Inter-American Center of Tax
Administrations (CIAT) and the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB).
Regarding demographic factors, we considered the percentage of the population
over age 65 reported by CEPALSTAT.
Under political determinants, we include several variables taken from Evelyne
Huber and John D. Stephens, Latin America and the Caribbean Political Dataset,
7
See the technical note on http://interwp.cepal.org/sisgen/SisGen_MuestraFicha.asp?indicador=134&id_
authoritarian regimes and semi-democracies, and as 1 for democracies. We also
incorporated government political orientation, taking into account the sum of the
proportion of seats in the lower house or constituent assembly held by right-wing
parties (right). With this information, we created a dummy variable with value 1, if
the right-wing parties held the majority of the seats and 0 otherwise. Finally, we
added time dummies to explicitly capture the inﬂuence of aggregate time series
trends. All variables will be calculated in levels and in differences (measured as
yearly changes) to capture long-term and short-term effects.
In Table 4 for Appendix, we present a table for descriptive statistics. We also
conducted a correlation analysis between explanatory variables using Spearman’s
rank correlation index.8 The highest correlation was observed between populations
over 65 and GDPpc (r = 0.71), while the growth of the population over 65 had in
general lower correlations with the rest of the variables. To discard multicollinearity
among independent variables, we will calculate the variance inﬂation factor (VIF)
after the OLS regression.

4 Methodology
There has been an intense debate about the appropriate models and estimation
methods to analyse the determinants of social expenditure (Dion 2006). The
literature has highlighted four main issues to take into account when estimating the
impact of the determinants of social spending:
1.
2.
3.
4.

Modelling in levels or in differences.
Correcting for serial correlation in the error terms.
Obtaining more efﬁcient estimators in the presence of contemporaneous
correlated errors across units and heteroskedasticity in panel data models.
Controlling for heterogeneities across observations and/or common time
shocks.

Regarding issue (1), there is a theoretical justiﬁcation for using levels or
differences depending on the expectations of how the independent variables
inﬂuence social spending. Avelino et al. (2005), Dion (2006), Huber et al. (2008)
and Lora (2009) estimate models in levels and put emphasis on long-term
relationships; whereas Snyder and Yackovlev (2000), Kaufman and Segura-Ubiergo
(2001) or Wibbels (2006) model in ﬁrst differences, obtaining information about
short-run effects. However, it is not only a theoretical choice since behind the
selection of the model there are econometric considerations that should be taken
into account. One of these is the existence of serial correlation in the error terms
(issue 2), which typically causes an underestimation of the standard errors
8

The Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient is sensitive to different data distributions, requiring normal
distribution and linear relationships between variables. Instead, we present Spearman‘s rank correlation
that assesses monotonic relationships, whether linear or not, not requiring normality. The correlation
frequently estimated using Prais–Winsten generalised linear regressions. An
alternative method is modelling a ﬁrst-order autoregressive panel data model,
adding lagged values of the dependent variable as regressor (Kaufman and SeguraUbiergo 2001; Avelino et al. 2005; Wibbels 2006; Dion 2006; Lora 2009). Beck and
Katz (1995) conducted simulations with both methods, recommending the lag
correction approach. However, it is still important to verify that the lagged
dependent variable effectively removes the serial correlation through a Lagrange
multiplier test (Kristensen and Wawro 2003).
An additional consideration is that models estimated in levels may show a
spurious correlation, since most economic time series are non-stationary in the mean
and show trend patterns (Granger and Newbold 1974). Cointegration techniques
provide an excellent framework to test for the existence of a stable long-run
equilibrium relationship between the non-stationary series (Engle and Granger
1987).9 This relationship can be described by an error-correction version (ECM) of
an autoregressive distributed lag approach (ARDL). Kaufman and Segura-Ubiergo
(2001) and Wibbels (2006) use an ARDL–ECM model to analyse the determinants
of social expenditure growth in Latin American countries, regressing this variable
against its own lag and other explanatory lagged variables in levels and differences
to capture the short- and long-term. The estimated error-correction term measures
the speed of short-run adjustment to long-run equilibrium after an exogenous shock.
For this to happen, the coefﬁcient needs to be statistically signiﬁcant and negative,
meaning that the error term is stationary, and therefore there is a cointegration
relationship between social expenditure and its determinants, where any deviation
from the equilibrium in the previous period will be adjusted at a rate given by this
error term. We may also interpret this equation as a conditional beta convergence
model, where the negative error-correction term is showing the presence of beta
convergence and the control variables are giving information about different
characteristics (levels and differences) that condition the convergence process to
country-speciﬁc long-term upper-level equilibriums.
Issue (3) points out the need to deal with the contemporaneous correlation of
errors across units—due to the common shocks in a given time period, and panel
heteroskedasticity—caused by time-invariant individual characteristics of each unit,
which cause ordinary least squares (OLS) estimators to be inefﬁcient. To avoid both
problems, and the ﬁrst-order serial correlation, Beck and Katz (1995) using Monte
Carlo methods propose an alternative estimator based on OLS with panel-corrected
standard errors (PCSE), a method widely used in political science research.
However, Kristensen and Wawro (2003) ﬁnd that PCSE are robust only when
individual effects are not taken into account in the model or not correlated with
explanatory variables. Reed and Webb (2010: 11) ﬁnd that the PCSE estimator does
not perform as well when the explanatory variables are highly persistent, the error
terms are serially correlated and the number of time periods is relatively short in
comparison with the number of cross-section units. Under these circumstances, the
9

Therefore, it is necessary to check the integration properties of the series using panel unit root tests,
hypotheses.
Issue (4) refers to the unobservable heterogeneity between units or individual
effects, which may cause omitted variable bias. In dynamic panel data models, if the
unit-speciﬁc effects are stochastic and they are correlated with the lagged dependent
variable, then the OLS estimator is inconsistent due to its correlation with the error
term (Bond 2002). Thus, before running the PCSE model, it is necessary to control
for time and individual effects (Kaufman and Segura-Ubiergo 2001; Wibbels 2006).
There is an additional issue that must be taken into account: the potential
endogeneity bias of some or all of the explanatory variables, causing the OLS
estimator to be biased and inconsistent. This is not at least only the case of the
lagged dependent variable in levels, but also those variables determined by others in
the system due to bidirectional causality. In this regard, we expect the presence of
causal dynamics between social expenditure and some of the explanatory variables.
For instance, Lampman (1984) enumerates a list of beneﬁts and costs of social
expenditures to economic growth due to the positive effects on output of education,
health, and the economic security of the labour force; macroeconomic stabilization;
¨
labour supply effects; productivity effects and resource reallocation effects. Gorg
et al. (2008) also ﬁnd a positive impact of social welfare expenditure on FDI
inﬂows, conﬁrming the view that multinationals value the contribution of social
expenditure on the increase of education and health standards, the development and
maintenance of a social fabric and the reduction of political unrest. They also
guarantee the cooperation of the unions and increase workers’ and ﬁrms’ incentives
to invest in the industry. These relationships should be taken into account before
carrying out any empirical analysis.
A common approach to control for endogeneity is through instrumental variables,
where the generalised method-of-moments (GMM) developed by Hansen (1982)
has been the most widely used procedure to obtain efﬁcient estimators in the
presence of heteroskedasticity (Baum et al. 2003). Lora and Olivera (2009) and Lora
(2009) apply a ﬁrst-difference GMM estimator to analyse the vulnerability of social
expenditure to several ﬁscal variables, using as instruments the lagged levels of the
explanatory variables. However, as Blundell and Bond (2000) point out, when the
lagged values of the series used as instruments are weakly correlated with the ﬁrst
differences of the endogenous variables, then the ﬁrst-differenced GMM estimator
results are expected to be downward biased in the direction within the groups. This
problem is even more severe when series are highly persistent and the time period is
small (Yasar et al. 2006). For this reason, Arellano and Bover (1995) and Blundell
and Bond (1998, 2000) recommend the use of the system GMM estimator, which
combines the moment conditions deﬁned for the ﬁrst-differenced equation with the
moment conditions deﬁned for the level equation. It uses the lagged levels of the
series as instruments for the ﬁrst-difference equation and the lagged ﬁrst-differences
of the series as instruments for the level equation. Blundell and Bond (1998) showed
that the system GMM estimator results in consistent and efﬁcient parameter
Following the methodological issues discussed above, we need to ﬁrst verify
that the panel model represents a structural long-run equilibrium relationship
and not a spurious regression. Estimates from non-stationary series can reveal
this problem, unless they are cointegrated. The non-stationarity of the variables
will be tested by panel unit root tests, since univariate unit root tests such as
Dickey–Fuller or augmented Dickey–Fuller can suffer from poor power
properties in small samples (Pierse and Shell 1995). We speciﬁcally use Im
et al. (2003) and Fisher-type (Choi 2001) panel unit root tests. All tests were
conducted including constant and linear time trend, except for unemployment
and political variables that do not show a time trend. These results are reported
in Table 1.
Both tests support the hypothesis of a unit root for most of the level variables
demonstrating that the series are not stationary except for democracy, which is
stationary or integrated of order zero, I(0). The variables in ﬁrst differences are all
stationary, indicating that they are integrated of order one or I(1).
Next, we examine the long-run relationship between social expenditure and its
determinants estimating a panel error-correction model (ECM) to ﬁnd cointegration
relationships between the I(1) and I(0) variables of the model.
We start with an autoregressive distributed lag model ARDL (1,1) transformed
into an error-correction model (ECM) presented by Beck and Kats (1996: 11).
Dyit ¼ a0 þ Dxit b1k þ hðyitÀ1 À xitÀ1 ck Þ þ vit ;

ð1Þ

We can rewrite this model in a more intuitive way following Zivot (1994) and
Kaufman and Segura-Ubiergo (2001):
Dyit ¼ a0 þ hyitÀ1 þ Dxit b1k þ xitÀ1 b2k þ vit ;

ð2Þ

with b2k ¼ Àðhck Þ and vit ¼ gi þ uit where yit is social expenditure as a share of
GDP of country i in period t. Dyit is its growth. yitÀ1 is the lagged dependent variable
that corrects for autocorrelation in the error terms. Dxit is the growth of economic
and political variables. xitÀ1 is a vector of lagged economic and political variables.
vit is the composite error term that includes gi , the unobservable time-invariant
individual effects, correlated with the explanatory variables, but not with their
differences, and uit is the error term assumed to be i.i.d. (0, r2 ). b1k represents the
u
short-term impact of xit on yit , while h represents the long-term impact between both
variables, showing the rate at which xit and yit return to their long-term equilibrium
relationship (Beck and Katz 1996: 11). This coefﬁcient is precisely the error-correction term that measures the speed of short-run adjustment to long-run equilibrium
after an exogenous shock. If h is signiﬁcant and negative and the disturbance is
stationary, there is a long-term or cointegration relationship between social
expenditure and its regressors, where any deviation from the equilibrium in the
previous period will be adjusted at rate h10 . This result may also be interpreted as

results (see Table 2).10 Columns 1 and 2 show OLS and ﬁxed effect coefﬁcients. We
know that the OLS estimates are biased upwards, because the lagged dependent
variable is positively correlated with the ﬁxed component of the error term (gi ).
Conversely, the ﬁxed effect coefﬁcients are biased downwards due to the negative
sign on utÀ1 in the transformed error term. Given the opposite directions of bias in
both estimates, any consistent estimate should lie between these values (Yasar et al.
2006). The PCSE estimator controls for the heteroskedastic and contemporaneous
correlation in the error term across units. However, it may not perform as well in the
presence of persistent explanatory variables, serially correlated errors, and relatively
short time periods in comparison with the number of cross-section units (Reed and
Webb 2010). We ﬁnally present the ﬁrst difference generalised method-of-moments
estimator (GMMdif) and the system GMM estimator (GMMsys), setting out the
endogenous variables with their lagged levels in the ﬁrst case and the lagged levels
and differences in the second. With respect to endogeneity, the lagged dependent
variable (yitÀ1 ) is clearly endogenous (remember that Dyit ¼ yit À yitÀ1 ). We will
also assume that GDPpc, FDI inﬂows and ﬁscal variables are endogenous due to
reverse causality.11
Table 2 shows the relationship between social expenditure growth and its
determinants using different estimation procedures. In all cases, the coefﬁcients of
the lagged levels of social spending are signiﬁcant and negative. This indicates a
statistically signiﬁcant cointegrating relationship between social expenditures and
its determinants, showing a long-run equilibrium relationship between them. Any
unanticipated shock that changes the equilibrium path would be restored in the
future periods at speeds that range between 3.3% per year for the OLS regression
and 27% per year in the ﬁxed effect (FE) regression. But as we have already
mentioned, the OLS estimates are upward biased, while FE regression is downward
biased. The third column presents the PCSE regression12 which shows estimates
very close to those of OLS, presenting the same direction of bias (Chen et al. 2005).
Then we take into account the endogeneity of the lagged dependent variables among
the regressors together with some economic and ﬁscal variables (GDPpc, ﬁscal
burden, external debt and FDI inﬂow), using the ﬁrst-differenced GMM and the
system GMM estimators. The Arellano and Bond (1991) test for autocorrelation
conﬁrms that both GMM estimators are consistent, ﬁnding ﬁrst-order serial
correlation in the error term of the ﬁrst differences equation, but not second-order
serial correlation. The validity of the set of instruments consisting of the lagged
levels of the endogenous variables in t - 2 and earlier periods is tested by the
Sargan test of overidentifying restrictions.13 The ﬁrst-differenced GMM instruments

We estimated different System GMM regression in order to check the robustness of the independent
variables. Results were consistent with the estimates presented in Table 2. The results are available on
request.

We assume that social expenditures may affect and be affected by GDPpc, FDI inﬂows, ﬁscal burden
and external debt.

variables are not independent from the error term. In addition, the GMM in ﬁrst
differences error-correction coefﬁcient lies outside the conﬁdence interval given by
OLS and FE estimates, conﬁrming that it suffers from large ﬁnite sample bias
caused by weak instruments. The ﬁfth column presents the system GMM estimates.
The validity of both sets of instruments, lagged levels dated t - 2 and earlier in the
ﬁrst-differenced equations and lagged ﬁrst differences dated t - 2 and earlier in the
levels equations, is not rejected by the Sargan test of overidentifying restrictions and
the differenced Sargan test, respectively. In addition, the error-correction coefﬁcient
lies in between the OLS and FE estimates, which means that these coefﬁcients are
more efﬁcient and unbiased than the former speciﬁcations.
Focussing on the system GMM estimator, the error-correction term is - 0.098
meaning that the system adjusts towards long-run or steady state equilibrium at
almost 10% annually. Aggregate social expenditure will adjust to any discrepancy
between social expenditure and its determinants in previous periods at this speed.
This coefﬁcient also shows the presence of diminishing marginal returns in social
expenditures, which means that countries with a higher level of social spending tend
to have lower growth rates in this variable. These results support the existence of
beta convergence across Latin American countries. The next two columns report
estimates for the Washington Consensus period (1990–2000) and the postWashington Consensus period (2000–2012). We observe that the convergence
speed to steady state was higher in the ﬁrst period.15
To determine whether we are in the presence of absolute beta convergence
towards a common steady state or conditional beta convergence towards countryspeciﬁc steady states, we need to test for the presence of sigma convergence,
calculated as the coefﬁcient of variation of social expenditure growth. There would
be absolute beta convergence, if economies have diminishing returns in the
expansion of social expenditure and, therefore, a downward trend in the coefﬁcient
of variation. On the other hand, if we ﬁnd stationarity in the series with coefﬁcient
of variation far different from zero, we could conclude that there is conditional beta
convergence of each country towards its own steady state. Therefore, we look upon
convergence as a stochastic process (Bernard and Durlauf 1996) and test the
stationarity of the series by conducting an augmented Dickey–Fuller unit root test
and a Phillips–Perron test (Table 3).
As we can observe in Table 3, In all cases, we reject the null hypothesis of a unit
root, conﬁrming that the series are stationary with mean different from zero,
demonstrating that differences in countries’ growth rates are steady. This means that
each country has converged to its own steady state conditioned by structural

14
The null hypothesis of the Sargan test is that there is independence between the set of instruments and
the error terms. Thus, for instruments to be valid, failure to reject the null hypothesis is needed.

In Appendix 3 we include a table with the GMM system estimates of the economic, demographic and
political determinants for the main categories of social expenditure (education, health, social security and

differences, given by the statistically signiﬁcant determinants of social spending that
are analysed below.
Looking at the period as a whole (1990–2012), the factors that explained the
differences in social expenditure efforts between Latin American countries were:
ﬁscal burden and FDI growth both with a positive effect, while trade growth, the
level of external debt, the increase of interest payments on debt, the level of
democracy and its growth had a negative effect. However, when we distinguish
between the two sub-periods, we ﬁnd interesting contrasts. During the Washington
Consensus period (1990–2000), differences in social spending across Latin
American countries were mainly related to structural ﬁscal factors. As column 8
from Table 2 shows, those countries with a higher ﬁscal burden and lower external
debt experienced higher social expenditure growth, mainly in health programs in the
ﬁrst case and education spending in the second (see Table 6 in Appendix). Interest
payments on external debt had a negative effect on social expenditure, although its
level of signiﬁcance is below 10% (p value = 0.199). If we take this as valid, it
means that they may have caused a reduction social expenditure as highlighted by
Hunter and Brown (2000), Dion (2006) and Lora (2009). In Table 6 in Appendix,
we see that they impacted negatively on health expenditure during the ﬁrst period
1990–2000. This reﬂects the fact that during these years, Latin American
governments’ social spending decisions were clearly inﬂuenced by the ﬁscal
discipline imposed by the Washington Consensus and that the countries that could
increase their social expenditures more were those with a greater ﬁscal burden and
lower external debt. Other variables that affected social expenditure during this
period were economic growth, ﬁnding evidence for pro-cyclical effects and
validating the Wagner’s law of increasing state activity accompanying economic
growth. Those countries that increased their foreign direct investment inﬂows
tended to boost their social effort which gives support to the compensation
hypothesis, where higher international competition could have encouraged governments to increase social spending to boost workers’ productivity through greater
investment mainly in education, with a view to enhancing labour productivity. This
is not surprising as during this period, there was a move towards greater investment
democratic governments in Latin America have tended to spend more on education
programs, and right-wing governments spent less than centre and left-wing
governments, indicating that they were more committed to the prescriptions of the
Washington Consensus with respect to ﬁscal austerity.
As we have indicated, from 2000 Latin American countries were progressively
moving away from the guidelines of the Washington Consensus and, as our results
suggests, this altered Latin American governments’ social spending decisions,
which changed the factors that explained the differences in social spending growth
between Latin American countries. Results from column 7 clearly reﬂects a change
in social spending determinants between the two periods, showing that during the
post-Washington Consensus period, the evolution of social spending was mainly
determined by short-term or conjunctural variables rather than by countries’ ﬁscal
discipline. The growth of GDP per capita, ﬁscal burden, trade and FDI inﬂow were
the variables that explained the differences in the evolution of social spending.
Countries with a higher ﬁscal burden growth tended to spend more on social
programs, mainly through social security investments (see Table 6 in Appendix).
Countries also applied counter-cyclical measures to stabilize their social expenditures, as we found a negative and signiﬁcant effect between GDP per capita growth
and social spending17 (mainly in health expenditure). The 2008 international
ﬁnancial crisis contributed to the intensiﬁcation of this process. Additionally, the
increase in trade openness had a signiﬁcant negative impact on social expenditure
growth, negatively affecting education investments. This gives support to the
efﬁciency hypothesis during the post-Washington Consensus period, probably due
to claims of exporters exposed to increases in international competition as
evidenced by Kaufman and Segura-Ubiergo (2001) and Wibbels (2006). Finally,
governments facing higher FDI inﬂows tended to increase their social expenditures.
Other factors that affected social policy during these years were unemployment and
democracy, both with a negative impact on social expenditure growth. In the ﬁrst
case, higher unemployment is associated with lower tax income affecting negatively
the resources for social policies. This may have led to cuts in education spending to
offset the reduction in ﬁscal income. In the second case, the negative coefﬁcient on
democracy means that more authoritarian governments in Latin America have
tended to spend more on social policies, affecting mainly social security
investments (see Table 6 in Appendix). Avelino et al. (2005) observe that countries
in transition towards democracy may be able to increase social spending for the
poor, because of the strength of the voting power of this population sector.
Authoritarian regimes may take more drastic decisions for or against social
spending than democratic regimes, due to the absence of ‘‘veto points’’
characterised by Immergut (1990) or ‘‘veto players’’ postulated by Tsebelis
(2002), provided by different political systems to interest groups, not allowing them
16
In Appendix 3 we observe that FDI inﬂows positively affected education expenditures both in the short
term and long-term.
17
The effects of GDP per capita in both periods have a similar value but opposite signs, explaining why
more attention to social policies, promoting health expenditures (see Table 6 in
Appendix). This conﬁrms the results of Ruggie (1983), Diamant and Katzenstein
(1986) and Rodrik (1997) but goes against those of Ross (1997, 2000) and
Armingeon et al. (2001), for whom left-wing parties have a greater preoccupation
with the protection of workers through social security expenditure.

6 Conclusions
In this paper, we have examined economic, demographic and political determinants
of social spending in Latin America during the period 1990–2012 in 17 Latin
American countries. Special attention was paid to the evaluation of convergence
towards a common upper-bounded steady state (absolute beta convergence) or to
speciﬁc steady states conditioned by their country-speciﬁc determinants (conditional beta convergence). We also considered two sub-periods, the Washington
Consensus period (1990–2000) and the post-Washington Consensus period
(2001–2012), showing that those determinants may have affected the long-term
equilibrium of social expenditures in different ways.
For this purpose, we analysed an extensive list of determinants highlighted in the
literature, which may provide potential explanations about the different levels of
social expenditure in Latin American countries. We are aware that this list is not
exhaustive and that it would be important to consider other variables in future
research depending on the topic analysed.
In this context, we applied a dynamic panel data error-correction model to
capture short- and long-term relationships between social expenditure and the set of
economic, demographic and political variables. To control for the endogeneity bias
caused by bidirectional causality between social expenditure growth and some of its
determinants, we used GMM estimators. We treated as endogenous the lagged level
of social expenditures. We also assumed that GDP per capita, ﬁscal burden, external
debt and FDI inﬂow may have a reverse causality with social expenditures, i.e. that
those variables may affect and be affected by social expenditures. Before running all
the regressions, it was necessary to check for the order of integration of the series, to
discard the possibility of spurious results due to common trends between the
dependent and the independent variables. We found that all variables were
integrated of order 1, except for democracy that was already stationary in levels or
integrated of order 0. Concerning the regression procedure, we demonstrated that
GMM system estimators were more efﬁcient and unbiased than other estimators
proposed in the literature (OLS, ﬁxed effects, panel correction standard errors and
ﬁrst-differenced GMM). The system GMM regression found strong evidence of
cointegration between social spending and its determinants, which suggests that
there is a long-term relationship between those I(1) variables during the whole
period analysed. This analysis also shows diminishing returns in social expenditures, conﬁrming the hypothesis of conditional convergence toward country-speciﬁc
equilibriums, as disparities across countries did not disappear in the long run. That
them to a long-term equilibrium which is different for each country. It also means
that any unanticipated shock that changes the equilibrium path will be restored in
future periods at the speed given by the error-correction term.
Several variables are responsible for the differences in social security equilibriums across Latin American countries. During the Washington Consensus period
(1990–2000), countries appear to have reacted more evenly in their social
expenditure policies, relating their investment decisions to ﬁscal structural factors.
As a consequence, differences across Latin American countries reduced rapidly,
thereby possibly resulting in an absolute beta convergence toward a common social
expenditure steady state. However, the poor outcomes of the Consensus recipe in
terms of economic growth and inequality reduction drove Latin American
governments to progressively abandon this ﬁscal orthodoxy. After 2000, each
country tended to adapt its policies into a strategy of self-discovery, exploiting their
own economic and political characteristics and constraints (Rodrik 2005). During
the post-Washington Consensus period (2000–2012), countries reacted proactively
to promote an endogenous growth through short-term measures. In this respect, we
found that the pace of convergence to a long-term equilibrium reduced signiﬁcantly
with respect to the ﬁrst period. Also the determinants of social expenditure policy
changed and were now more related to short- term or conjunctural factors like ﬁscal
burden growth, GDP per capita growth, FDI inﬂow growth and international trade
growth.
Other determinants were stable during the whole period (1990–2012). Countries
seem to have applied a compensation hypothesis related to FDI inﬂows,
incrementing their social expenditures to boost workers’ productivity to overcome
greater volatility and risk as evidenced by Kaufman and Segura-Ubiergo (2001).
However, trade openness has negatively affected social expenditures in the second
period, mainly in education investment. With respect to GDP per capita growth, it
was an important short-term determinant of social expenditure, having a similar
impact in both periods but with opposite signs. During the ﬁrst period, countries
reacted positively to economic growth showing that social policy was pro-cyclical,
while in the second period it seems to be counter-cyclical. The economic downturn
after the 2008 international ﬁnancial crisis deepened this change, driving
governments to apply discretionary stabilization policies to counteract the negative
impact on employment, economic activity and social vulnerability.
The political variables show that during the ﬁrst period, democratic left-wing
governments tended to have a long-term positive impact on social expenditure,
speciﬁcally on education and health. By contrast, during the second period
authoritarian regimes, regardless of their ideological orientation, they may have
taken more drastic decisions in favour of social spending than in the case of
democratic regimes.
In conclusion, we have observed that structural and conjunctural differences
between Latin American countries explain the differences in the evolution of social
expenditure in the region. We do not ﬁnd a natural process of saturation and
convergence to a common upper-limit welfare state long-term equilibrium as stated
reduction in dispersion across countries indicates that Latin American countries are
not converging towards a common upper-bounded steady state on social effort.
Instead, these results must be interpreted as evidence of conditional beta
convergence, where each country is moving towards its own steady state in social
effort, which is consistent with the persistence of disparities across countries. The
disparities across countries in social expenditure growth are determined by
economic, demographic and political differences across Latin American countries.
