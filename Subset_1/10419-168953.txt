develop only after the fall of communism in 1989, when suddenly a lot of opportunities, but
also threats from abroad arose. The law changes, especially the Labour Code, were very
frequent. In 2004 Slovakia joined EU. Some changes, as for example public finance
consolidation, are still ongoing. But sometimes requirements put on new EU members are
higher than those put on some older EU member what can be observed with lower debt-toGDP turning point of new member states compared to established EU members (Mencinger
et al., 2014). The political system in Slovakia, as well as in other Visegrad countries,
underwent changes towards higher democratisation. Dynamic environment and frequent
law changes led many Slovak companies to a short-term planning. Sustainability did not
even exist in marketing or economic vocabulary. According to Slovak Soil Fertility
Research Institute (2012) the environmental aspects of the production were broadly ignored
which led to some ecological problems in many regions, mainly Jelšava, Hliník nad
Hronom, Nováky. The environmental impact on this region was caused by the extraction
and treatment of mineral raw materials and by chemical industry resulting in heavy water,
soil and air pollution as well as problems with waste management. The privatisation
transferred ownership of the huge state-owned companies to private ownership, atomised
them into smaller businesses and the main goal was the profit.
Entrepreneurs were lacking experience in more levels planning since they did not need to
plan by themselves in the past. Therefore, the short-term orientation of planning horizons is
a logical outcome (Rybanský et al, 2014). However, the situation was improved after 1998
when the amount of foreign direct investment increased. This transfer of capital is usually
accompanied by the transfer of technologies and knowledge. The so-called “knowledge
spillover” took form of more strategically oriented planning at all managerial levels,
especially in companies with the high share of foreign capital. Rybanský et al. (2014)
verified the effect of different factors on the planning periods (the existence of short,
medium, and long term plans of the organization) and concluded that none of the selected
factors had a statistically significant effect on the time periods of planning.
This study contributes to the research that was done on the link between sustainability and
marketing strategy in business organisations in Slovakia. Specifically, the study explores
the relation between the level of existence of the marketing strategy, its implementation in
the corporate strategy, adoption of the sustainability philosophy and the size of the
company, its legal form, the share of the foreign capital in its ownership structure and the
sector of national economy the company operates in. Authors provide empirical evidence
on existence of a link between the marketing strategy and environmental, social and
economic aspects of sustainability and thus advance the conceptual and empirical
grounding of this area. Furthermore, this paper is one of the first to empirically develop the
relationship between marketing strategy and adoption of sustainability approach in
companies doing business in a transition economy.
The rest of the paper is structured as follows: section 1 reviews the empirical literature on
sustainability in marketing management. Section 2 presents the data and the methodology.
In section 3, empirical results are summarized. In section 4, implications are discussed.
Section 5 concludes.

1.1 Classical approach to strategic marketing
Marketing is a discipline that offers market oriented business strategies to satisfy customer
needs and expectations (Fischer et al., 2011). A marketing strategy represents the marketing
logic by which the company hopes to create this customer value and achieve profitable
relationships (Kotler, 2011). Main points of successful strategy in marketing were clarified
by Madsen and Tan (2005) and include the creation, development and delivery of products
and services that satisfy the needs and wants of the customers but necessarily at a profit.
The prime role of marketing strategy is to achieve competitive advantage (Slater and Olson,
2001) and meet defined goals on the market (Holátová and Březinová, 2013). Therefore
marketing strategy is important component of strategy which cannot be overlooked. To
meet the main goal of the company it is necessary to follow typical marketing strategies
known for all companies, which are: product, price, promotion and place strategies (Borza
and Borza, 2014). Very important component in the strategy is also quality of all activities
done in business operations (Prístavka and Bujna, 2013). The success of each company is
based on ability to develop their own key focuses. For instance, in the case of Starbucks,
the marketing strategy is mostly centred in 4 key elements: Authenticity, Human
Connection, Participation and Core Focus (Jang and Jung, 2013). Is this enough for
businesses that would like to be leaders in their segments? None of these definitions deals
with corporate social responsibility, let alone sustainability.
1.2 Corporate social responsibility approach to strategic marketing
Corporate social responsibility could be named also as a marketing strategy for
organizational performance (Adegbola, 2014; Torugsa et al., 2012; Pergelova and AnguloRuiz 2013). The relationship between marketing and the corporate social responsibility has
been studied for decades with outcomes being influenced by the prevailing economic
paradigm at a specific point in time (Moir, 2001). The study of Adegbola (2014) concludes
and recommends that there are some inherent pitfalls in corporate social responsibility
regarding marketing operations of corporate organizations, which tend to negate the interest
of consumers. It means that firms should endeavour to apply best practices of corporate
social responsibility in their marketing activities to protect the interest of consumers and the
society. The key difference between social marketing theory and traditional business
marketing theory is the goal. In social marketing the goal will always be to benefit society,
at least in part. In traditional marketing, the goal is to always increase sales figures and
business market share, increasing either purchases or the number of consumers purchasing.
The two may often be at odds with each other when set side by side, but some combination
is possible (Adegbola, 2014). Connection between society objectives and companies’
objectives leads to sustainability of all activities in business for the future. There is a call
for a stronger engagement of firms’ sustainable development and a delivery of this
engagement to the present and future stakeholders through re-designing products,
processes, business models and governance systems (Preuss and Dawson, 2009; Porter and
Kramer, 2011; Browne and Nuttal, 2013; Harangozó and Zilahy, 2015). According to
Cronin et al. (2011) and Leonidou, Katsikeas, and Morgan (2013) cited in Zeriti et al.
(2014) emerging research in marketing suggests that firms can derive performance benefits
from the adoption of sustainable marketing strategies.
A review of marketing literature reveals that sustainability is becoming an area of
pedagogical interest in our discipline, although coverage remains marginal (Bridges –
Wilhelm, 2008). Sustainability is the key issue which has emerged in marketing strategy
over the time (Kumar et al., 2012) and according to Bridges and Wilhelm (2008) there are a
number of business schools that have already incorporated sustainability into their
curricula. Sustainable marketing is an extension of traditional marketing management
practice where decision making tasks are same as in traditional marketing approach, but the
decision outcomes may be quite different (Fuller, 1999). Sustainability is defined as “a
vision of the future that provides us with a road map and helps us to focus our attention on
a set of values and ethical and moral principles by which to guide our actions” (Munier,
2005). Sustainability works on ‘Triple Bottom Line’ approach i.e., people, planet and profit
(Charter et al., 2006; Arnould and Press, 2011; Beltz and Peattie, 2012; Savitz and Weber,
2013). Arnould and Press (2011) see a sustainable marketing organization (SMO) as an
organization that is committed to ongoing, measurable improvements in its relationships
with its external natural and social environments and internal organizational processes
consistent with general sustainability goals. SMO is driven by the overarching goal of
achieving organizational resilience both in the short and long term time horizons and
stretches natural resource use by striving to increase the productivity of a given unit of
virgin resource by a measurable, meaningful amount, while at the same time seeking to
identify and incorporate alternative recycled or renewable resources into its operations.
Reassessment of societal and environmental issues resulted in evolution of green or
environmental issues in marketing strategy and now the sustainability in marketing strategy
has become the focus of attention of the researchers (Kumar et al., 2012; Chofreh et al.,
2014, Kiron et al. 2015; Dabija and Pop, 2013). Today, sustainability is that area which is
being explored by companies for growth and development (Abdulrazak and Ahmad, 2014;
Dvořáková and Zborková, 2014). According to Veiderman (cited in Munier, 2005),
sustainability is defined as a vision of the future that provides us with a road map and helps
us to focus our attention on a set of values and ethical and moral principles by which to
guide our actions. Sustainability is a long term vision that deals with development of
strategy based on ethical and moral principles (Zucchella and Urban, 2014). But, most of
the time, the meaning of sustainability is understood as environmental sustainability, but it
is limited not only to environmental issues, but also include the social and economic issues
(Obermiller et al., 2008).
Definitions of sustainability say that business practices should be assessed in terms of
sustainability through economic, environmental and social dimensions (Jackson, 2006;
Seyfang, 2009). Sustainability in the field of marketing is studied through different
perspectives. Some authors took environmental or green issues (Polonsky, 1995; AragonCorrea, 1998; Buysse and Verbeke, 2003; Camino 2007; Menguc et al., 2010), and other
took social issues (Maignan et al., 2004 and 2005; Eger and Egerová, 2013; Ubrežiová et al.,
2013; Dabija et al., 2014). But sustainability has three dimensions – environmental, social
and economic, where the third one includes also marketing activities. We can see that green
product and distribution programs positively affect firms’ product- market performance,
while green pricing and promotion practices are directly positively related to firms’ return on
assets. The revenue benefits can more than compensate for the costs involved in such
investments. (Leonidou et al., 2013). Economic dimension has been analysed by Ferrell et al

social aspect. There exist only a small number of studies which focused on the link between
sustainability and marketing strategy (Whiting, 2008; Kumar et al., 2012; Peattie and Belz,
2012). Marketing strategy respecting the sustainability concept is not easy to formulate and
implement, because customer is the one according to needs and wants of whom marketing
strategy of the company is designed (Kumar et al., 2012). Nowadays we can observe that
principles of sustainability based on a balance between protecting the environment,
maintaining cultural integrity, establishing social justice, promoting economic benefits, and
improving living standards in a long term are about to being applied in marketing
management. Dean (2014) suggests considering following sustainable practices: recycling
and waste stream management programs, product design standards (cradle-to-cradle design),
product take-back programs, human resource policies designed for diverse employee groups
and employees with children, employee Stock ownership program (ESOP), travel methods,
transport of goods, supplier relations and accountability, health and wellness programs, paid
volunteer time in the community, corporate giving and charitable contributions, other items
that feed into the company’s values and mission.
As Charter et al. (2006) says, it is time to include sustainability criteria into marketing,
which is the need of the hour. The companies should keep in mind that sustainability has
become a requirement; it does not remain as an option. There is need to consider
sustainability to develop marketing strategy, which means that the company has to adopt
sustainability in strategic marketing practices and marketing mix (Kumar et al., 2012). The
goal of sustainability marketing strategy has changed to attain competitive advantage
through a position that is desirable, different, and defensible (Obermiller et al., 2008).
According to sustainability principles there is need to conserve the resources and to
consume less, while on the other hand, the principle of marketing says to sell more, which
means more production, hence more consumption of resources (Jones et al., 2008).
Sustainability in marketing strategy not only helps in competitive advantage but also opens
the door for cost savings and innovation. It is rightly said that companies cannot stay for
longer in the market if they will not become truly sustainable (Whiting, 2008). According
to Thompson (2010) sustainable marketing applies when an organization takes the
perspective that it operates within a finite resource system, and thus has a responsibility to
its current and future stakeholders to make strategic decisions for the long-term benefit of
the entire system. Companies can decide between several approaches: incorporating the
costs of ecosystem services into operations, incorporating natural systems in new product
development and operations, minimizing the firm’s overall carbon footprint or trying to
change technologies they deploy in order to enhance rather than diminish natural resources.
Belz and Peattie (2012) define sustainable marketing as a macromarketing concept insofar
as macromarketing is concerned with the effects of marketing on whole systems, such as
institutions, value chains, or industries. Sustainable marketing is an approach to marketing
that ideally aligns internal organizational processes and organizes resources that create
value for stakeholders (owners, shareholders, employees, value chain partners) and through
which the external natural and social environments are enriched by the activities of the
firm. Sustainable marketing is a process not a state. This process commits a firm to make
continuous improvements toward the goals of increasing the resilience of the social
environment and restoring the natural environment it operates within, in addition to thriving
as an economic entity (Arnould and Press, 2011). Sustainable marketing results benefit the
customer, environment, and organization. Here we have to stress that sustainable marketing
materials, reduction of waste, product cost, brand perception, natural ingredients, product
utility, and product availability. Other variables like customer solutions, networks with
business partners in order to increase barters and decrease all kinds of costs, addressing
societal and environmental concerns, customer costs including affordable price for
customer, fair price and fair profit of a company, environmentally friendly distribution and
convenience of buying a product, green communications vis-à-vis all shareholders and
others play also an inconsiderable role. The most effective is to pursue all these marketing
sustainable practices in collaboration with business partners. As Patrick Hynes in Kiron et
al. (2015), whether you`re a business or an organization, part of civil society or a public
sector voice, there is an understanding that complex problems require perspectives from all
three of constituencies. Public sector cannot stand aside as well.
A review of the relevant literature reveals that the research has focused on three main
dimensions of sustainability, but it is hard to identify appropriate research analysing the
relation between the sustainable marketing philosophy and the existence of marketing
strategy in the organization, especially in Central and Eastern Europe. In order to provide
the answer about the link between the existence of marketing strategy and the adopting of
sustainability philosophy into all parts of corporate strategies of business organizations in
Slovakia, we set up following hypotheses (figure no. 1):
H1: Existence of marketing strategy influences the implementation of sustainability concept
in companies in Slovakia.
H2: The size of the organization (expressed as a number of employees) influences the
implementation of sustainability concept in companies in Slovakia.
H3: The legal form of the organization influences the implementation of sustainability
concept in companies in Slovakia.
H4: Business organizations with foreign ownership adopt the concept of sustainability more
readily when compared to domestic business organizations.
H5: Certain sectors of national economy prefer the concept of sustainability more often
than others.

Figure no. 1: Adopting the sustainability approach in companies in Slovakia
The purpose of this study is to investigate the link between sustainability and marketing
strategy in companies in Slovakia. Since sustainability is still perceived as a new
phenomenon in Slovakia, the descriptive (initial mapping of the field) and exploratory
(determining the significance of impact of selected variables on formulating of marketing
strategy, its implementation into corporate company strategy and the adopting of
sustainability concept) research approaches have been chosen. Authors assume that it is not
possible to use the concept of sustainability in marketing without existing formalized
marketing strategy and its implementation into corporate company strategy. Therefore, the
existence of formulated marketing strategy is a prerequisite to adoption of sustainability
approach to marketing strategy. As a result, the evaluation of association between
marketing strategy and sustainability approach, as well as determination of which
characteristics influence the formulation of marketing strategy and its implementation into
corporate strategy was very appropriate. Commonly the most used characteristics of a
company are its size (number of employees) and legal (organisational) form. The business
organization can be characterized also by the share of foreign capital in its ownership
structure and the sector of the national economy the company operates in. This set of
characteristics was used by Rybanský et al. (2014) and Egerová et al. (2013).

The results of marketing research are respected when
creating plans functional areas of other companies.
Three items were used: The environmental aspects
of production are prioritised (further in text
as Sustainability – production); The content of further
education of employees is partially focused on
sustainability issues (further in text as Sustainability –
human resources); The company is investing heavily
in modernisation of production facilities
(further in text as Sustainability – investment).

The survey was performed from September 2012 to May 2014. There were 896 valid
questionnaires from randomly selected respondents working in different business
organizations. It is representative with margin of error of 3.2 % and confidence level of
95 % (total number of companies in Slovakia was 569372 in 2014). Apart from the
introductory classification items (legal form, number of employees, proportion of foreign
capital, field of activities, work position of the respondent and the company seat) the
questionnaire contained items divided into seven topic areas: objectives, planning process,
planning of marketing, production and stock planning, HR planning, financial and
investments planning, control. These topics follow the areas that the planning in a company
usually focuses on (Robbins and Coulter, 2012). The majority of questionnaire items were
scaled from 1 to 7 (the Likert-type scale). Value 1 corresponded to the absolute
disagreement of the respondent with the statement in the wording of the item (formulated as
a positive statement), whilst value 7 corresponded to the absolute agreement of the
respondent. Since all of the items were marked as “mandatory”, the added value 8 enabled
respondent not to comment on a given item. The rest of the questionnaire items were
dichotomist. So were the ones that we used as the explained variables (existence of
formulated marketing strategy: 0-no, 1-yes; implementation into corporate company
strategy: 0-no, 1-yes).
2.3 Characteristics of the sample
The most frequent legal form in the sample is limited company (59.4%). The second largest
group of organizations is joint-stock company (19.1%). Third one consisted of other legal
forms (mostly tradesmen) (14.3%). Quite a few of the legal forms represented public
company, limited partnerships and cooperatives. The composition of the sample by legal
status corresponds to an overall composition of businesses. The most commonly-used legal
form in SR is a limited company, partnerships are used rarely (it is relatively easy and
cheap to establish a limited company with low personal risk of the owner when compared
to public company or limited partnership) and cooperative as a legal form is typical
especially for agriculture (historical context, see Ciaian et al., 2001; Rizov et al., 2013).
There are several approaches to measuring the company size, for example turnover, equity
and profit. Authors expressed the size of the company according to the number of its
employees, while they respected the standard size classification. In terms of the size a
sample was divided fairly evenly. Micro-organizations accounted for 26.2%; Small
business organizations 28.9%; medium-sized business organizations for 24.2% and large
business organizations remaining for 20.6%. SMEs (Small and medium sized enterprises SMEs) were represented in the sample by over 53%. The authors were interested in the
share of foreign capital in the ownership structure of organizations (table no. 2). 56% of the
organizations in the sample consisted of organizations without share of foreign capital. The
second largest group was the organizations in which the share of foreign capital in their
ownership structure exceeded 80%. It is necessary to approach to the reliability of the
presented classification with reservations, since not all the respondents have perfect
overview of the amount of the share of foreign capital in the organization where they work.
The least of organizations are located in the quaternary sector (only 5.9%), on the contrary,
the most of them are in tertiary sector, service sector (41.2%). In the primary sector are
located 20.6% of organizations, in secondary sector 32.3% of organizations.

2.4 Statistical Methods
The reliability of the questionnaire was verified by means of Cronbach´s alpha (=0.878).
The method of split-half measurement instrument was used as the second method of
verifying the reliability (=0.864). With regard to the achieved results it is therefore possible
to regard the reliability of the measurement instrument as sufficient. The construct validity
was verified by means of factor analysis using the varimax rotation of factors. It is the most
commonly used method for rotation procedure. Varimax rotation of factors is an orthogonal
method of rotation that minimises the number of variables with high loadings on a factor,
thereby enhancing the interpretability of the factors (Malhotra and Birks, 2006). The
suitability of applying the factor analysis was verified on the basis of Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin
Measure of Sampling Adequacy (KMO test) and Bartlett´s test of sphericity. The condition
of the minimum number of respondents (150) was met. The results of both testing statistical
methods were satisfactory (Bartlett´s test: p <0.05; KMO test >0.7, the value reached was
0.861). The assumptions of applying the factor analysis were met. The factor analysis
identified two background factors which altogether explained almost 70% of the total
variance (68.3%). Based on the fact the identified factors fully correspond with
questionnaire’s content, we regard the construction validity of the measurement instrument
satisfactory. To evaluate the influence of independent variables the authors used binary
logistic regression. The dependent variables are the existence of a marketing strategy
(I_19), implementation of marketing strategy into corporate company (I_20, I_26) and
adopting the sustainability approach (I_30, I_45 and I_58). Independent variables are: the
size of the company (NUM_E), the legal form of the company (LEG_F); the sector of
national economy the company operates in (SECTOR), the share of foreign capital in the
ownership structure of the organisation (SH_F_CAP. The variables LEG_F and SECTOR
are nominal; the variables NUM_E and SH_F_CAP are ordinal. The functional form of
regression is as follows:

Based on results of tests of robustness it can be concluded in some cases the assumption of
equal variances was violated. Therefore, it is necessary to interpret results with caution. The
authors have applied several different models in order to determine the relations between
the existence of marketing strategy and selected factors. The results show that the best
model was the one without interactions. The results of logistic regression are given in the
table no. 3. In the range of 16.5 % to 61.2 % all independent variables explain the variance
depending on the variable. The best explained variable is the Sustainability – production,
the worst explained variable is Sustainability – investment. There was significant
association between NUM_E and the Sustainability - production (p = 0.03). Variable
SH_F_CAP significantly associated with Sustainability – human resources (p = 0.04).
Variable SECTOR significantly associated with both Sustainability – production (p = 0.02)
and Sustainability – human resources (p = 0.00). All dependent variables apart from
Sustainability – investment are significantly associated with variable LEG_F.
To be able to better explain the associations confirmed by the logistic regression, authors
used Turkey’s posthoc test to find out which respondent groups are responsible for the
association. As results show, in relation to the existence of a marketing strategy and its
implementation, attitudes of respondents are influenced by the legal form of the company
they are working for (LEG_F). Self-proprietors tend to express more negative attitudes
towards formulating the marketing strategy and its implementation when compared to
respondents working for JSC and Ltd and they also express more negative attitude towards
respecting the environmental aspects in production (variable “sustainability – production”).

Note: The coefficients for LEG_F are in contrast with the "Sole proprietorship" group. The
coefficients for NUM_E are in contrast with the "over 250“ group. The coefficients for SH_F_CAP
are in contrast with "over 81%" group. The SECTOR´s coefficients are in contrast with the

Statistically significant influence is flagged (*statistically significant at 0.05 confidence level;
**statistically significant at 0.01 confidence level)

In relation to the association between the variable “sustainability – production” and the size
of the company (NUM_E) it can be concluded, that the environmental aspects of
production are better respected in the companies where the number of employees exceeds
10. Simply put, the respondents working in micro-sized business organizations expressed
more negative attitude towards variable “sustainability – production” than those working in
SMEs and large companies. What the sector of the national economy (SECTOR) concerns,
the attitudes of respondents working for the companies in the service sector differ from the
attitudes of respondents working in the primary and the secondary sector. There is an
interesting association between the share of the foreign capital in the ownership structure of
the company (SH_F_CAP) and the variable “sustainability – human resources”. The
domestic organizations (SH_F_CAP=0%) are less willing to provide further education for
their employees focused on the sustainability issues when compared to companies in which
the SH_F_CAP exceeds 40 %. It can be concluded that the country of origin effect applies.
4. Discussion
It has been over 20 years since the World Commission on Economic Development
(WCED) brought “sustainability” into the mainstream of business practice and scholarly
research. The concept of sustainability is increasingly being addressed theoretically by
scholars and practically by managers and policymakers. With this growing focus on
sustainability efforts, marketing is in a unique position to elevate its focus from managing
relationships with customers to strategically managing a broader set of marketplace issues
(Hult, 2011). Considerable research on sustainability provides the opportunity to make
a substantial contribution to mainstream marketing theory (Chabowski et al., 2011).
The article evaluated the level of association between marketing strategy and
environmental, social and economic aspects of the sustainability, as well as determining
which characteristics influence the establishment of marketing strategy and its
implementation into corporate company strategy. The results show that there is a link
between the existence of formulated marketing strategy and the selected environmental,
association is medium at best; however, it is statistically significant. Hypothesis 1 was
confirmed. Coviello et al. (2000) argue in certain areas, marketing practices differ between
smaller and larger firms. For example, size-related differences are reflected in the approach
to market planning, where smaller firms are found to be more informal than larger firms.
Smaller firms also use fewer ways to measure market performance than larger firms. At the
same time, the findings also indicate that small firm marketing practices are similar to those
of larger firms in many ways, with both transactional and relational marketing relevant
across firm size. The authors` findings show that the size of an organization (according to
the number of its employees) has no impact on whether the organization has formulated a
marketing strategy or not. Hypothesis 2 was not confirmed. Organization size does not
affect accord or marketing strategy with the overall corporate strategy. On the other hand,
the size of the company affected the attitudes of respondents towards respecting the
environmental aspects of production. They are more readily respected in SMEs and large
companies when compared to micro companies.
A discussion whether the individual size categories of organizations have a typical legal
form or not could emerge. The results of correlation indicate that these two factors correlate
statistically highly significantly (p = .000), but the association is small bordering to medium
(0.28; 0.32). Due to the coding it follows (table 1) that in the sample there are also included
JSCs and Ltds with a small number of employees as well as companies, or cooperatives,
employing a larger number of workers. The study confirmed a statistically significant
influence of the legal form on existence of formulated marketing strategy, its consistency
with the overall corporate strategy and adopting the concept of sustainability in business
organizations in Slovakia. Hypothesis 3 was confirmed. Tukey's test confirmed that this
difference is saturated by different attitudes of respondents employed in JSCs and Ltds
when compared with self-proprietors. In all cases, the attitude of respondents working in
the JSC and Ltd was more positive compared with self-proprietors.
The transfer of capital is usually accompanied by the transfer of technologies and
knowledge. A lot of publications is focusing on foreign direct investments (FDI) spillovers
in the area of human capital (Gaumont and Leonard, 2010), technology, research and
development (Todo, 2006), productivity (see Kathuria, 2000; Serenčéš et al. 2010) and
knowledge (Girma, 2005). The so-called “knowledge spillover” in the area of planning took
form of different planning know-how utilized in Slovak business organizations (these
business organizations were usually characterised by the high share of foreign capital in
their ownership structure; the country of origin effect kicked in). The authors wondered
whether the increasing share of foreign capital increases the probability of a clearly defined
marketing strategy as a prerequisite of the implementation of the concept of sustainability
of a particular organization. The results of logistic regression, however, showed that the
share of foreign capital in the ownership structure of the organization is not a statistically
significant factor in relation to existence of marketing strategy, respectively to its
compliance with the overall strategy of the organization. However, very interesting is the
finding that education focused on sustainability takes place mostly in companies in which
the share of foreign capital in their ownership structure exceeds 40 %, especially when
compared to domestic companies. Based on this result it can be stated that the business
organizations with foreign ownership adopt at least some sustainability aspects (social)
more readily when compared to domestic ones. Hypothesis 4 was confirmed.

Buysse and Verbeke, 2003; Camino 2007; Fraj- Andrés, 2008; Nagyová et al., 2013) would
be preferred in the primary sector of national economy; the social approach (Maignan et al.,
2005; Eger and Egerová, 2013; Ubrežiová et al., 2013) would be preferred in tertiary sector,
the sector of services. Both assumptions were confirmed by the results of logistic regression
(table 4). Authors have found out that in coexistence with marketing strategy and with
corporate strategy, one of the four sectors of the national economy dominates, but not
significantly. It is the tertiary sector. However, the overall significance of the variable
"SECTOR" in relation to the existence of marketing strategy and its implementation into
corporate company strategy was not confirmed. Hypothesis 5 was not confirmed.
Conclusion
Authors investigated the existence of marketing strategy in business organizations in
Slovakia and adoption of sustainability principles in their corporate strategies. Generally,
the results clearly indicate that marketing strategy is not of primary concern for some
organisations. This is in line with the assumption that the concept of sustainability in
marketing is a new concept in Central and Eastern Europe. Another major finding is that
the legal form of a company is a relevant determinant of sustainability approach to
establishment of marketing strategy and its further implementation into corporate strategy.
Based on results it can be concluded that the environmental aspect of concept of
sustainability is determined by the size of organization and the sector of national economy
the company operates in, while the social aspect is determined by the share of foreign
capital in the ownership structure of an organisation.
These findings are not particularly surprising, as sustainability is not the key issue for most
of Slovak organisations. It is rare to see that sustainability dominates all operational
marketing decisions when simultaneously taking care of economic and social
environments. Nevertheless, sustainability is a crucial challenge for all organisations
aiming to enhance their competitive advantages. The research survey raises a number of
important issues that ought to be considered by companies during their engagement in
concept of sustainability. Research findings contribute to a better understanding of the
association between marketing strategy implementation in different types of business
organizations and their adoption of sustainability philosophy. They may also provide a
useful platform for future research in this area.
While this study provides useful findings about sustainable marketing in Slovakia, it also
has limitations that call for further research. First, the target group consisted not only of top
managers. Therefore, the first line managers could have problems to assess the share of
foreign capital in ownership structure or the extent to which the marketing strategy is
implemented into overall business organization strategy. Second, the use of convenience
sample from one country and the national context mean that the findings cannot be
generalized. We can only assume that similar findings apply to other Central and Eastern
European countries, particularly the Visegrad Group of countries, as well as other
developing countries all over the world.
