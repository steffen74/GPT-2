At present, the globalization tendency of all the economic and social elements determines an
identical approach of the contemporary life crises. Negative phenomena, such as pollution or the
using up of resources, at a national, as well as at world level, are the result of a multitude of
preoccupying problems, such as: poverty, environment degradation, workplace insecurity,
disappearance of traditional values, unemployment, etc.

1. THE CONCEPT OF SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT

The term sustainable development was introduced in our current language in the last decade,
and the importance it was assigned to it is reflected in the vast literature which arguments the
necessity of reconsidering the current relation between the human being and the environment. One
will try to systematically identify the aspects specific to this type of development and to elaborate
some new concepts, meant to provide some criteria for the reorientation of human activities. Thus,
there are over 60 definitions of the concept of sustainable development. The area of these
interpretations is somewhere between the two extremes: the one of the first report from Rome –
which approaches the stopping of economic growth – and the one of the “greens”, who assign an
absolute value to the role of the natural environment. (Angelescu, 2004, p. 242).
The concept of sustainable development was used, for the first time, by the prime-minister of
Norway, Gro Harlem Brundtland, in 1987. As president of the World Commission on Environment
and Development, he presented the report entitled, in which sustainable development was defined

generations to meet their own needs” (Brundtland, 1987). This report was the fruit of the over three
years‟ long collaboration of 20 politicians and experts in economic development and ecology from
all over the world.
The message of this report can also be found in “principle 3” of the Rio Declaration on
Environment and Development, from 1992, according to which “the right to development must be
fulfilled so as to equitably meet developmental and environmental needs of present and future
generations”.
The standard ISO 14000 also refers to this concept, mentioning that “all the types of
organizations, are increasingly concerned about achieving and demonstrating sound environmental
performance by meeting the requirements of environmental regulations and limiting the impacts of
their products or services on the environment. These aspects are outlined in the context of the
increasingly strict legislation, of the development of economic policies and of other measures meant
to encourage environment protection, the increase of the concerns of the interested parties with
regard to environment related issues, sustainable development inclusively” (Rojanschi, Bran, and
Grigore, 2004, p.63).
Sustainable development refers to the long term preservation of the functional capacity of the
interconnected systems of contemporary society, taking into consideration the economic, ecological
and social aspects (Crăciun, 2004, p. 184). It is not easy to find a balance between these
components, for (Teodosiu, 2004, p. 16):
from an economic perspective, it is necessary to efficiently assign resources or limited
goods, which involves a flexible economy and free access to exchanges;
from the perspective of the environment, the pollution limits must not be exceeded and
biodiversity must be preserved;
from a social perspective, it is necessary to ensure the equality of social chances,
opportunities, freedoms and justice.

Figure 1 – Sustainable development factors

Starting from the factors that influence one another in the development process – population,
resources, agricultural production, industrial production and pollution – the sustainable
development strategy aims at finding the most adequate criteria for the optimization of the needsresources ratios, the objectives to attain and the necessary means, based on mutual compatibility,
in time and space. Thus, one must conceive and obtain an economic environment which, via its
entries and exits, must find itself in a state of dynamic compatibility with the natural environment,
as well as with the present and future needs and interests of the generations that coexist and follow
(Rojanschi and Bran, 2002, p.51). As concerns the action of these factors, one may see that, in the
world system, two of them are positive loops in reverse connection, namely the exponential growth
of the population and of industrial production, and three factors represent the negative loops:
pollution, the using up of natural resources and poverty. If the evolution of the first two factors will
be corrected so as not to reach a sudden and uncontrollable decline, then it is possible to have
economic and ecologic stability (Caracota and Caracota, 2004, p. 13).
Sustainable development approaches the concept of life quality, under economic, social and
environment aspects, promoting the idea of balance between economic growth, social equity,
efficient use and the preservation of the surrounding environment. The key element of sustainable
development is the reconciliation between the development process and environment quality, the
promotion of the integrated process of elaboration and decision making, at a global, as well as at a
regional, national or local level. Also, sustainable development depends on the correct repartition of

characterize sustainable development are:
concern for equity and correctitude among countries and generations;
long term vision on development;
systemic thinking –interconnection between environment, economy and society.
Sustainable development strategies outline the interdependence between the local and the
global, between the developed and the developing countries, with emphasis on the need for
cooperation within and among the economic, social and environment components.
2. SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT MEANS “TO THINK GLOBALLY AND TO
ACT LOCALLY”

The major objectives of the sustainable development of communities are the protection of the
environment, the eradication of poverty, the improvement of life quality, the development and
preservation of a viable and efficient local economy.
A sustainable community has control over the development process and adopts, in this
respect, a series of decisions meant to guarantee sustainability at a local level. It also has an active
social structure – associates, groups and institutions capable of mobilizing themselves for long term
common actions and of taking responsibility for this continuous development process. The
sustainable community has a vision on development, supported and promoted by all the community
sectors, civic associations, local authorities, etc. A sustainable community appreciates and promotes
healthy ecosystems, makes efficient use of the resources, develops and ensures a viable local
economy.
The sustainable development of communities is primarily aimed at eradicating poverty at a
local level, laying emphasis on local resources, which can be structured into four categories:
human capital: knowledge, skills, capacities, creativity, adjustment strategies;
physical capital: infrastructure (constructions, roads, etc.);
natural capital: water, air, soil, flora and fauna;
social capital: governing and decision making structures, communication and culture.
Sustainable communities are prosperous because the population woks in collaboration and
partnership in order to improve life quality. Sustainable communities make use of their own
resources in order to provide for the needs of the current generation and, at the same time, for the
resources necessary for the future generations. They mobilize their capacities in order to provide

prevention of pollution, the maximization of conservation, the development of local resources and
their efficient use for the revitalization of the economy. The more deterritorialized the economic
activities, the less they can be controlled by the authorities. Hence, it is necessary to ask
multinational corporations to be democratically accountable. Table 1 presents some statements of
intent of some multinational companies, which mention the concept of sustainability (Crăciun,
2004, p. 180).

“The environment programs of Volvo will be characterized by a
holistic vision, permanent improvement, technical development and the
efficient use of resources. Via these means, Volvo will gain competitive
advantages and will contribute to sustainable development”.

3. ABOUT GLOBALIZATION

The conception and philosophy of sustainable development have been and will continue to be
crystallized into the elaboration and the factual achievement of the regionalization and globalization
projects. These focus, among others, on the decentralization of institutions, on the delegation of

2003, p. 74).
The phenomenon of globalization overturns the ancient economic, political and social
conceptions that governed the world for decades. The economic crises from the last decade of the
20th century best illustrate the fact that the development systems must be reconsidered and
reoriented towards new tendencies.
The globalization of world economy started in the mid 80s, gained field and adepts in the 90s
and continues to manifest itself in the present as well, although it must face regionalist or nationalist
conceptions.
Globalization is a complex phenomenon, which primarily consists in the stronger integration
at a regional, as well as at world level, of the countries and population following the introduction, at
a large scale, of information innovations that led to the significant reduction of transportation and
communication costs, to the elimination of artificial barriers from the path of goods, services,
capitals, knowledge and people, among states (Caracota and Caracota, 2004, p. 145).
Globalization is the inexorable integration of the markets, the national states and the
technologies in an unprecedented degree, namely in a way which gives individuals, enterprises and
national states the possibility of going further, faster, deeper and cheaper than ever before and in a
modality which, on the other hand, produces a strong reaction from those that are either harmed or
left aside by this new system (Crăciun, 2004, p. 169).
Under the strictly economic aspect of the efficiency of resources distribution and utilization,
economic globalization appears as a rational phenomenon, meant to provide a larger volume of
goods and services with increasingly fewer resources. Thus, economic globalization involves, in
essence, the globalization of the process of creation of the gross domestic product of the states
throughout the world.
In the report of the World Bank on World Development, from 2000, it is stated that two
parallel processes occur in the world economy: globalization and decentralization:
- globalization consists in the trans-nationalization, until over-nationalization, especially in
the fields of trade, finance and top technologies;
- decentralization consists in the transmission, by the local government to the local
communities, of an increasing number of administrative, social, educational and budget related
attributions, and, consequently, the role of the national state will be limited to diplomacy, army, the
adoption of internal legislation.
An objective analysis of the globalization process until now illustrates the fact that
economic advantages incline more towards developed countries and towards the great economic

financial mechanism, which, via its institutions, the International Monetary World, The World
Bank, the World Trade Organization, dominated by the great economic powers, advantages, to an
overwhelming extent, the developed countries involved in the granting of credits, the realization of
direct foreign investments through which the crediting transnational institutions and companies
obtain large profits.
However, globalization also has its negative side. First of all, especially in the less developed
countries, many suffered from the globalization, primarily as concerns the social security system.
Many others were marginalized by the global markets. Secondly, globalization also led to the
deficient allotment of resources between private and public goods. The prices are capable of
creating richness, but they are not meant to answer any other social needs. Trying to make profit,
without any precautions, may lead to the deterioration of the environment and to a conflict with the
other social values. Thirdly, global national markets can give birth to crises. It is possible for the
inhabitants in developed countries not to be fully aware of the devastating consequences of financial
crises, for they have the tendency of affecting, to a greater extent, the developing countries (Soros,
2002, p. 25). Table no. 2 presents some of the effects of globalization.

economy and sustainable development. The UNO debates emphasized a remarkable convergence of
views on the challenges that the world faces at present, when the need for a more equitable world
economy, where all the countries should have a fair chance to competition and where those who
“have more” must support those “who have less” is acutely felt.

as well as with the present and future needs and interests of the generations that coexist and follow
(Rojanschi and Bran, 2002, p.51). As concerns the action of these factors, one may see that, in the
world system, two of them are positive loops in reverse connection, namely the exponential growth
of the population and of industrial production, and three factors represent the negative loops:
pollution, the using up of natural resources and poverty. If the evolution of the first two factors will
be corrected so as not to reach a sudden and uncontrollable decline, then it is possible to have
economic and ecologic stability (Caracota and Caracota, 2004, p. 13).
Sustainable development approaches the concept of life quality, under economic, social and
environment aspects, promoting the idea of balance between economic growth, social equity,
efficient use and the preservation of the surrounding environment. The key element of sustainable
development is the reconciliation between the development process and environment quality, the
promotion of the integrated process of elaboration and decision making, at a global, as well as at a
regional, national or local level. Also, sustainable development depends on the correct repartition of

characterize sustainable development are:
concern for equity and correctitude among countries and generations;
long term vision on development;
systemic thinking –interconnection between environment, economy and society.
Sustainable development strategies outline the interdependence between the local and the
global, between the developed and the developing countries, with emphasis on the need for
cooperation within and among the economic, social and environment components.
2. SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT MEANS “TO THINK GLOBALLY AND TO
ACT LOCALLY”

The major objectives of the sustainable development of communities are the protection of the
environment, the eradication of poverty, the improvement of life quality, the development and
preservation of a viable and efficient local economy.
A sustainable community has control over the development process and adopts, in this
respect, a series of decisions meant to guarantee sustainability at a local level. It also has an active
social structure – associates, groups and institutions capable of mobilizing themselves for long term
common actions and of taking responsibility for this continuous development process. The
sustainable community has a vision on development, supported and promoted by all the community
sectors, civic associations, local authorities, etc. A sustainable community appreciates and promotes
healthy ecosystems, makes efficient use of the resources, develops and ensures a viable local
economy.
The sustainable development of communities is primarily aimed at eradicating poverty at a
local level, laying emphasis on local resources, which can be structured into four categories:
human capital: knowledge, skills, capacities, creativity, adjustment strategies;
physical capital: infrastructure (constructions, roads, etc.);
natural capital: water, air, soil, flora and fauna;
social capital: governing and decision making structures, communication and culture.
Sustainable communities are prosperous because the population woks in collaboration and
partnership in order to improve life quality. Sustainable communities make use of their own
resources in order to provide for the needs of the current generation and, at the same time, for the
resources necessary for the future generations. They mobilize their capacities in order to provide

prevention of pollution, the maximization of conservation, the development of local resources and
their efficient use for the revitalization of the economy. The more deterritorialized the economic
activities, the less they can be controlled by the authorities. Hence, it is necessary to ask
multinational corporations to be democratically accountable. Table 1 presents some statements of
intent of some multinational companies, which mention the concept of sustainability (Crăciun,
2004, p. 180).

3. ABOUT GLOBALIZATION

The conception and philosophy of sustainable development have been and will continue to be
crystallized into the elaboration and the factual achievement of the regionalization and globalization
projects. These focus, among others, on the decentralization of institutions, on the delegation of

2003, p. 74).
The phenomenon of globalization overturns the ancient economic, political and social
conceptions that governed the world for decades. The economic crises from the last decade of the
20th century best illustrate the fact that the development systems must be reconsidered and
reoriented towards new tendencies.
The globalization of world economy started in the mid 80s, gained field and adepts in the 90s
and continues to manifest itself in the present as well, although it must face regionalist or nationalist
conceptions.
Globalization is a complex phenomenon, which primarily consists in the stronger integration
at a regional, as well as at world level, of the countries and population following the introduction, at
a large scale, of information innovations that led to the significant reduction of transportation and
communication costs, to the elimination of artificial barriers from the path of goods, services,
capitals, knowledge and people, among states (Caracota and Caracota, 2004, p. 145).
Globalization is the inexorable integration of the markets, the national states and the
technologies in an unprecedented degree, namely in a way which gives individuals, enterprises and
national states the possibility of going further, faster, deeper and cheaper than ever before and in a
modality which, on the other hand, produces a strong reaction from those that are either harmed or
left aside by this new system (Crăciun, 2004, p. 169).
Under the strictly economic aspect of the efficiency of resources distribution and utilization,
economic globalization appears as a rational phenomenon, meant to provide a larger volume of
goods and services with increasingly fewer resources. Thus, economic globalization involves, in
essence, the globalization of the process of creation of the gross domestic product of the states
throughout the world.
In the report of the World Bank on World Development, from 2000, it is stated that two
parallel processes occur in the world economy: globalization and decentralization:
- globalization consists in the trans-nationalization, until over-nationalization, especially in
the fields of trade, finance and top technologies;
- decentralization consists in the transmission, by the local government to the local
communities, of an increasing number of administrative, social, educational and budget related
attributions, and, consequently, the role of the national state will be limited to diplomacy, army, the
adoption of internal legislation.
An objective analysis of the globalization process until now illustrates the fact that
economic advantages incline more towards developed countries and towards the great economic

financial mechanism, which, via its institutions, the International Monetary World, The World
Bank, the World Trade Organization, dominated by the great economic powers, advantages, to an
overwhelming extent, the developed countries involved in the granting of credits, the realization of
direct foreign investments through which the crediting transnational institutions and companies
obtain large profits.
However, globalization also has its negative side. First of all, especially in the less developed
countries, many suffered from the globalization, primarily as concerns the social security system.
Many others were marginalized by the global markets. Secondly, globalization also led to the
deficient allotment of resources between private and public goods. The prices are capable of
creating richness, but they are not meant to answer any other social needs. Trying to make profit,
without any precautions, may lead to the deterioration of the environment and to a conflict with the
other social values. Thirdly, global national markets can give birth to crises. It is possible for the
inhabitants in developed countries not to be fully aware of the devastating consequences of financial
crises, for they have the tendency of affecting, to a greater extent, the developing countries (Soros,
2002, p. 25). Table no. 2 presents some of the effects of globalization.

Impacts of globalization
The absence of regulation of the capital global markets leads to risks
and financial instability.

Employe
es

Corporations delocalize their production units in developing countries
in order to reduce the costs on the global market; here they find conditions
for the exploitation of employees with a different cultural profile and
divergent moral values.

Consume
rs

Global products are the target of the attacks with regard to cultural
imperialism and forced occidentalization. Vulnerable consumers from
developing countries are subjected to exploitation by multinational
corporations.

Suppliers

The suppliers from developing countries must comply with the

and

regulations imposed by multinational corporations via the management of

competitors

the supply networks. Small competitors are exposed to much stronger
opponents.


Global economic activities put corporations in direct interaction with

society

various local communities, thus creating the premises for the disappearance

(pressure

of the traditional lifestyles from the respective communities. Thus one

groups, NGOs, witnesses the birth of active pressure groups who aim at monitoring and
local

publicly exposing the corporations that activate in countries the

communities)

governments of which are weak and tolerant.

Governm

Globalization weakens national governments and increases the

ents and legal responsibilities of corporations with regard to the workplace, living
regulations

standards, environment protection, observance of certain ethical criteria.

Nowadays there is a general, almost consensual political perception, with regard to global
economy and sustainable development. The UNO debates emphasized a remarkable convergence of
views on the challenges that the world faces at present, when the need for a more equitable world
economy, where all the countries should have a fair chance to competition and where those who
“have more” must support those “who have less” is acutely felt.
