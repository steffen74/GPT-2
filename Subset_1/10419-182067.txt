This group of subsets refers to all possibilities in the
combinations between two types of vehicles (BEVs
and HEVs) and two UFT markets (retail and express/
post) including the empty set (unspecified). The total
number of the subsets in this group is derived from the
product of the subsets’ numbers of two vehicle types
and two UFT markets (  2 ∙ 22 = 16 ). The brackets in
2
some subsets represent that the elements in the brackets
are one subset. For instance, in the subset: (BEVs,
HEVs) - Retail, the two vehicle types are considered
as one subset in the set V and the retail market is the
subset in the set M. This subset presents a situation that
the two vehicle types can be simultaneously employed
in the same UFT market. Following this example, the
combinations between four types of ECVs and five UFT
markets generate 512 possibilities in the set CECV-UFT.
This number implies that assessment of satisfactory
match for increasing the market penetration of ECVs
also has to consider the diversity outlined in this
section.
3	METHODOLOGY
This paper applies a Systematic Literature Review
(SLR) to accomplish its goal. The SLR is preferred
because it provides a rigorous and systematic protocol
to search and select scientific articles related to a
particular topic as well as analyzing and synthesizing
contributions of such articles to derive findings [51–53].
Conducting this rigorous protocol enable reviews to
minimize the risk of bias and obtain transparent as well
as reasonable conclusions [54]. This paper adapts the
SLR methodology from Benetti et al. [51]. It comprises
five steps, which are a statement of objective, selecting
sources, selecting keywords and articles, classification
and summarization of results.
Statement of Objective: The objective of carrying
the SLR is to identify the primary focus of existing
works and the extent of diversity (the number of ECVUFT combinations) already considered in the literature.
The role of this identification is to collect evidences for
exploring the significance of studying the diversity in
the employment of ECVs in UFT.

Selecting Sources: The literature is searched
mainly in four academic databases, which are Web
of Science, Scopus, IEEE Explore and Springer Link.
These databases are preferred because they cover
multidisciplinary journals, books, and conference
proceedings. In addition, searching articles in these
databases enables us to track and understand state of
the art comprehensively in regard to the employment
of ECVs in UFT.
Selecting Keywords and Articles: This step specifies
keywords to use in searching relevant literature from
databases, as well as criteria for filtering articles. Thus,
to search the literature on the employment of ECVs in
UFT, the keywords “electric”, “vehicle”, “urban”, and
“freight” (Table 4) are specified. In addition to these
keywords, there are synonyms, such as van and truck
(vehicle), city (urban), and distribution, logistics as well
as last mile (freight). These synonyms are also used
in querying the databases. Furthermore, the related
terms, such as hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and fuel cell are
also considered in the query. Each database is searched
using two queries. The specified key terms are searched
in titles, abstracts, and keywords of the literature.
After specifying the keywords, a search process is
conducted to select articles. Four criteria including time
span, language, repetitions, and pertinence are applied
to filter the articles. Firstly, a time span to search for
the latest literature is chosen. As far as the world has
approximately increased their attention on ECVs in
UFT since last decade, then this paper uses a time
span that ranges from 2007 to 2018. Further criterion
concerns articles published in the English language. To
this effect, the two queries were conducted in the four
databases to yield 2752 articles. Further filtration of the
articles involves checking for redundancy (repetitions).
Deleting redundant resulted in a total of 1957 articles.
An additional task involves examining titles and
abstracts of such articles to identify their pertinence.
Since some articles focus on studying buses, bikes,
tricycles, passenger cars, rail and sea transport,
which are irrelevant to the ECVs and the UFT, such
impertinent articles are excluded. In the end, a total of
on the primary focus of the article. Accordingly, base
criteria for this classification are the areas of focus,
and the issue addressed in each article (as presented
in Table 5).
Summarizing Results: Finally, the areas of focus,
the number of ECV-UFT combinations considered in
the literature, the publication years, countries of origin,
and subject areas are illustrated as the results by using
tables and diagrams. The goal of summarizing these
results is to enable further analysis.
4	RESULTS
This section presents results obtained after searching
and filtering the literature. The analysis of results
falls in the following categories: years of publication;
country of origin; subject areas; thematic description,

and; existing ECV-UFT combinations. Beginning
with years of publication, Fig. 2 shows the number
of articles published per year (from 2007 to March of
2018). The figure portrays that publications addressing
issues related to ECVs in UFT had increased in a period
between the years 2014 to 2017.
The second consideration entails analysis of results
in a perspective of countries in which the publications
originated (Fig. 3). As far as authors of articles may
originate from different countries, this figure is
plotted in terms of the affiliations of first authors. In
a summarized form, a total of 47 published articles
originated from Europe; eight articles originated from
North America, three articles originated from Asia.
South America and Africa had one article each.
Furthermore, Fig. 4 summarizes the subject areas of
these articles as part of the results. These areas are
determined by journal subjects in whom these articles
are published. Notably, different categories of the
same subject area, such as the transportation category

and the urban studies category in social science are
considered as a one-subject area, namely social
science. In addition, some journals involve more than
one subject area. For example, the journal Transport
Research Part D involves two subject areas: social
science and environmental science. To this effect, all
these subject areas, which are involved in the same
journal, are also counted in Fig. 4.
The thematic description of reviewed articles involves
three main aspects: area of focus, issues addressed, and
approach or method used (Table 5). This description
reveals that existing literature has focused mainly on
four areas to address fifteen issues. The four areas are
feasibility, adaptations of logistics concept, adaptations
of vehicle concept, and support of stakeholders.

Proper choice of ECVs for UFT

Multi-criteria analysis

and competitiveness of this employment were mainly
discussed. The second area focuses on the adaption of
existing logistics concept. Several possible solutions
were proposed by adapting the existing logistics
concept to fit the characteristics of ECVs. Similarly,
some other possible solutions adapted existing vehicle
concepts to satisfy the requirements of UFT in the
third area. Finally, to facilitate the employment of
ECVs in UFT, the fourth area explored possible
solutions for supporting stakeholders. According
to the number of articles in each area, there are 32
articles (53%) studied the feasibility of ECVs, 20
articles (33%) adapted logistics concept, 4 articles
(7%) adapted vehicle concepts, and the rest of 4 articles
(7%) explored solutions for supporting stakeholders.
Among these articles, three of them in the area of
supporting stakeholders are related to the satisfactory
match. Besides, there is no articles directly studied the
diversity in the employment of ECVs in UFT.

In spite of this, the diversity in the employment of
ECVs in UFT may be indirectly considered in the
literature. To present the extent of the diversity has
been indirectly studied in the literature, the ECVUFT combinations, which have been discussed in the
extracted 60 articles, are subsequently summarized in
Table 6. The number of each ECV-UFT combination
appeared in the literature and in which topics these
ECV-UFT combinations have been studied are
introduced in this table.
In total, the 60 articles involved 16 ECV-UFT
combinations. Some articles considered only one
vehicle type in one UFT market, such as BEVsRetail and HEVs-Express/post. On the contrary, some
articles discussed diverse vehicle types in various
UFT markets, such as (BEVs, HEVs, PHEVs)-(Retail,
Express/post). These diverse vehicle types and
various UFT markets in the brackets are respectively
regarded as one subset. Furthermore, the results show
that operating BEVs in an unspecified UFT (BEVUnspecified) is the most popular combination studied

has appeared in entire four topics. Following the
BEV-Unspecified combination, the BEV-Retail and
the BEV-Express/post combinations have attracted
relative high attention. Besides, the area of feasibility
has involved the most types of ECV-UFT combinations
(75%) appeared in the literature in comparison with the
other three areas.
5	DISCUSSION
This section presents discussion to increase an
understanding conveyed by analyzed results. The
discussion takes into account the main areas of focus
and the existing ECV-UFT combinations. As a result
of this discussion, future research works, which once
addressed can increase market penetration of ECVs in
UFT, are accordingly proposed.
According to results in Fig. 3, the majority of the
continents have paid the attention on the employment
of ECVs in UFT. In these continents, Europe and North
America seem ahead of other continents. Furthermore,
results on the subject areas (Figure 4) show that
dealing with the employment of ECVs in UFT involves
interdisciplinary studies. To this effect, improving
employment of ECVs requires involving not only
studies in the social science, engineering, computer
science, and environmental science but also energy,
psychology, decision science, business, management,
and accounting.
5.1	

Employment of ECVs in UFT –
the Primary Focus
In dealing with the employment of ECVs in UFT,
the literature appears to focus primarily on four
areas, namely: feasibility, adaptations of logistics
concept, adaptations of vehicle concept, and support
of stakeholders (Table 5). Therefore, subsequent
subsections present respective discussions.
5.1.1	Feasibility
In a standpoint of feasibility, the literature has identified
the limitations, opportunities, and competitiveness of
employing ECVs in UFT. In identifying these issues,
most of such literature relies on the survey, case study,
simulation as research methods. The literature identifies
many opportunities, which drive the employment of
ECVs in UFT. Some of these opportunities are the
positive environmental performance (low emissions,
noise, and energy consumption) and the positive social
attitude (drivers and freight operators) [60–62, 64].
Some other opportunities are the financial incentives
(subsidies, tax exemption) and the non-financial
incentives, such as preferential parking for ECVs,
initiating repair centers for ECVs, allowing ECVs to
drive on high occupancy or bus lanes, and privileges of
accessing to low emission zones in city centers [7, 9].

11

Besides such opportunities, the literature has also
identified limitations, which hinder the employment of
ECVs in UFT. The limitations include:
•	 Cost: high purchase price, battery price,
infrastructure costs [57, 60–62, 64]
•	 Technology: long charging time, limited driving
range, payload capacity, battery lifetimes [57, 58,
60, 63, 64]
•	 Infrastructure: networks, diverse types of
charging stations (battery charging with cables,
battery swapping, or battery wireless charging),
compatibility, grid issues [56, 60]
In addition to outlined matters, there are other issues.
These issues comprise security, limited availability
of vehicles, few proper business models and lack
of a comprehensive understanding between freight
operators and policy makers [9, 60, 61, 65].
The literature evaluates competitive advantages to
employ ECVs in UFT, as compared to diesel commercial
vehicles. The evaluation of this competitiveness
focuses mainly on the economic and environmental
perspectives. The economic perspective discusses
the impact of the purchase cost, battery cost, fuel
cost, and financial incentives for the competitiveness.
The environmental perspective deals with some
performances, such as CO2 emissions and energy
consumption. The results of the evaluation show that
the competitive advantages of ECVs depend on their
powertrains and GVW. In general, the light-duty BEVs
are the most competitive vehicles to operate in some
parts of UFT, such as express/post market [68, 69,
72]. For the medium-duty vehicles, diesel commercial
vehicles remain the most interesting solution from
the financial point of view [67, 75]. In the segment of
heavy-duty vehicles, HEVs are more competitive with
running in city areas rather than highway [67, 70].
As one of the implications in the area of feasibility,
it can be implied that the replacement of diesel
commercial vehicles with ECVs in UFT appears
possible. Additionally, some solutions and research
perspectives have been suggested to address the issues
raised by the studies on the feasibility. For example,
from the economic point of view, the literature [24, 25,
66, 68, 75] proposes to reduce the battery cost and the
purchase price; to raise the fuel price (diesel and petrol),
and; increase vehicle utilization (traveled distance
per year per vehicle). From the technological point of
view, it is recommended to develop Information and
Communications Technology (ICT), infrastructures
(networks and inductive systems), as well as EVRP by
taking into account fleet sizes and charging strategies
[7, 56, 57, 60, 63]. From the policies’ point of view,
Taefie et al. [9] suggest to implement a city toll on the
long-term and allow drivers with a class B license to
drive ECVs over 3.5t. In addition, Roumboutsos et al.
[55] suggest transferring leadership from central to
municipal authorities for promoting the employment
in literature have focused on adapting the existing
logistics concepts, which are primarily designed for
operating diesel commercial vehicles. The limited
battery capacities of BEVs, as one of the characteristics,
have been mainly discussed in this perspective of
logistics. Schneider et al. [16], Guo et al. [88], and
Panagiotis et al. [89] have formulated the EVRP in the
condition of recharging BEVs at depots and available
charging stations en route. On the contrary, Conrad and
Figliozzi [14] and Aggoune-Mtalaa et al. [85] proposed
vehicle routing models to recharge BEVs at customer
locations rather than recharging stations. In exclusion
of these articles that focus on homogeneous fleets,
Van Duin et al. [83], Mirhedayatian and Yan [86], as
well as Rezgui et al. [87] have investigated the EVRP
with heterogeneous fleets. In addition to literature
addressing the EVRP, Deflorio and Castello [97] study
a concept of charging-while-driving to assess traffic
and energy performance of electric power systems for
dynamically charging ECVs while driving. Schau et
al. [96] and Kretzschmar et al. [95] adapted existing
ICT systems to predict the range of BEVs for fitting the
limitation of battery capacities. Thus, to fit the limited
battery capacities, the studies on the EVRP, the ICT,
and the charging-while-driving have been conducted
in the area of adapting logistics concept.
To further fit the characteristics of ECVs into UFT,
some works focused on innovating logistics concept.
The combinations of UCCs and BEVs are one of the
innovative logistics concepts. This concept suggested
to constructing UCCs in relative proximity to the
urban areas and replacing diesel commercial vehicles
with BEVs to deliver goods in the cities [90, 91]. In
this context, the limited driving range of BEVs is not a
restriction anymore, because the daily traveled distance
is shorter than the driving range [94]. Moreover,
although the low payload capacity of BEVs led to more
traffic, the total distance traveled, and CO2 emissions
were reduced by conducting this concept [90–92, 94].
In addition to the concept of UCCs, Faccio and Gamberi
[98] introduced an innovative distribution network to
integrate the distribution of goods in a cluster of linked
small cities. Furthermore, to decrease the congestion
resulting from the limited parking spaces, Boussier et
al. [99] modeled a management process of the parking
places sharing between car drivers and dedicated
areas of goods deliveries. Besides, to reduce the total
cost and increase the utilization of ECVs, Taefi [100]
proposed an innovative combination of the day and
night delivery by using BEVs. Given these points, to
support the employment of ECVs in terms of their
existing limitations, some works are contributing to
this support by adapting the existing logistics concepts.

5.1.3	 Adaptations of Vehicle Concept and
Supporting Stakeholders
To improve existing limitations of ECVs for satisfying
the requirement of UFT, there are some works focused
on the area of adapting vehicle concepts. For example,
to fit the diverse delivery tasks in UFT, Andaloro et
al. [101] defined and developed a flexible and modular
light-duty BEVs with high payload capacity and a
rolling chassis, which allows the integration with
different powertrains and different upper bodies (vans
or box vans). Molfino et al. [102] designed a new
architecture for light-duty BEVs to autonomously load
and unload palletized or boxed goods. Clarembaux et
al. [103] improved the perception and control system
of light-duty BEVs for parking/docking process. In
addition, to adapt medium-duty HEVs to the parcel
and delivery service, Lewis et al. [104] studied a fuel
cell HEV to properly size the fuel cell and battery by
using real-world operational data and duty cycles.
On the whole, to improve the limitations of ECVs
for efficiently delivering goods in diverse UFT, the
flexible and modular BEVs, the autonomous loading
and unloading, the intelligent parking/docking, the
high payload capacity, and the proper size of fuel cell
and battery in HEVs have been studied in the adaption
of vehicle concept.
Besides the vehicle and logistics concept, the possible
solutions for supporting stakeholders have been explored
as well. For instance, to support authorities increasing
their understanding on the limitations of adopting ECVs
in UFT, Lebeau et al. [8, 105] investigated the choice
behavior of transport companies for BEVs by applying
survey and conjoint based choice analysis. To support
transport companies selecting appropriate BEVs for
UFT, Watróbski et al. [50] proposed a unique approach
in terms of multi-criteria analysis and discussed
as well as ranked 36 available BEVs in the market.
Furthermore, to support authorities employing ECVs
in large scale, Cheng and Liu [106] provided a business
operating model, which respectively considered
different practitioners (battery plants, energy supply
companies, automobile companies) as individual
operating companies, to compare and discuss their
advantages and disadvantages. To sum up, in the area
of supporting stakeholders, the existing works studied
the preferences of stakeholders for ECVs, proposed
approaches of selecting proper ECVs, and discussed
possible business models to facilitate the employment
of ECVs in UFT.
5.1.4	 Trend in the Literature
Regarding the percentage of articles in each area
(section 4), it appears that there is an unbalanced and a
quite distinct focus in the literature. In particular, 53%
of total articles focused on the area about the feasibility
of ECVs. Moreover, there are 33% of total articles
considered the adaptions of logistics concept. The least
focus is seen in the adaptation of vehicle concept (7%)

Fig. 5: Number of articles in each area
reveal that many studies focus on addressing the
feasibility of ECVs as the main area. In spite of this,
upon observing the number of articles in each area of
focus from 2007 to March 2018 (Fig. 5), there is a trend
of shifting the attention from the area of feasibility to
other areas.
Since 2015, the areas of focus have been enriched. The
attention has started to be paid not only on the area of
feasibility but also on the rest of three areas. It indicates
that exploration of possible solutions to accelerate the
employment of ECVs in UFT has gradually become a
focus since the feasibility of employing ECVs in UFT
has been widely accepted in academia. Accordingly,
the areas of adapting logistics and vehicle concepts as
well as supporting stakeholders have been increasingly
studied in the literature. Although the majority of
articles still focus on feasibility studies, the Fig. 5 shows
that the trend of shifting the attention to the other areas
has emerged in the existing works. This trend implies
that the areas of focus may shift to exploring possible
solutions in the context of the feasibility of some ECVUFT combinations that have been studied.
5.2	 Existing ECV-UFT Combinations
Although there are four areas of focus, which studied
the employment of ECVs in UFT, the diversity in the
employment, from which the satisfactory match can
be obtained, have been overlooked. To explore the
significance of the diversity and to what extent the
diversity has been indirectly involved in the literature,
the number of existing ECV-UFT combinations is
counted in Section 4. The result shows that there are
16 ECV-UFT combinations studied in the 60 articles.
To render this result comparable with the number of
total ECV-UFT combinations (512), the all possible
subsets in these 16 ECV-UFT combinations are further
derived. The procedure of deriving the subsets is same
as the formation of the 512 ECV-UFT combinations.

For instance, the combination of the three vehicle
types (BEVs, HEVs, PHEVs) and the two UFT markets
(Retail, Express/post) constitutes 32 (  3 ∙ 22 ) possible
2
subsets including empty sets. In total, there are 236
possibilities derived from the calculation of all possible
subsets in each of the 16 ECV-UFT combinations.
Since some subsets are repeatedly calculated, there
are finally 82 possible ECV-UFT combinations derived
from the existing 16 ECV-UFT combinations exclusive
of the repeated subsets. The details of the 82 possible
ECV-UFT combinations are shown in Appendix Table
8. Obviously, in comparison with the total number of
ECV-UFT combinations, the 82 possible ECV-UFT
combinations accounts for only a small portion of this
total number (16%). This percentage indicates that the
literature has paid least attention to many other possible
ECV-UFT combinations (approximately 84%).
The least attention paid by the literature may lead to
the low market penetration of ECVs. In other words,
the results derived from few specific ECV-UFT
combinations in the literature may only contribute
to understanding and solving few specific scenarios.
For instance, in the area of feasibility, few ECVUFT combinations were examined. It leads to a
limited understanding concerning the feasibility of
the rest of ECV-UFT combinations. This shortage
of comprehensive understanding may result in the
hesitation of decision-makers in considering the
employment of ECVs in UFT. To this effect, this
hesitation may influence the market penetration of
ECVs.
Furthermore, in the areas of adapting logistics and
vehicle concepts as well as supporting stakeholders,
studies on few specific ECV-UFT combinations may
only provide few specific solutions. For instance,
according to the results obtained from Table 6, the
most popular ECV-UFT combination is the BEV
solutions proposed from this combination may only
contribute to a few specific decision-makers, who
intend to employ BEVs. Similarly, this limited range
of possible solutions may also influence the market
penetration.
Given these points, the little diversity studied in the
literature may hinder the improvement of the market
penetration of ECVs in UFT. To this effect, three
articles in Table 5 emphasizes the significance of taking
into account the diversity as follows. Lebeau et al. [67]
revealed the opportunities of reducing costs of UFT by
including different fuel types of commercial vehicles
in a fleet. Watróbski et al. [50] stated the importance of
considering the specificity of the delivery tasks in UFT
to properly choose BEVs. Christensen et al. [77] noticed
the significance of the diversity and investigated the
suitable commercial sectors of UFT to employ BEVs.
5.3	 Future Research
Towards increasing the market penetration of ECVs in
UFT, future research may firstly focus on extending
the range of studies about the ECV-UFT combinations.
This extension in the future research contains the
ECV-UFT combinations, which have not been studied
in the literature yet. For instance, taking into account
the HEVs and PHEVs to complete the delivery tasks
in construction and waste markets (Table 7) can be a
part of the extension. Furthermore, in this extension,
it is essential to examine the feasibility of these ECVUFT combinations. The results of the studies on the
feasibility may provide researchers and practitioners
a comprehensive view about other possible ECV-UFT
combinations. In a long-term perspective, the range of
this extension may also integrate the FCEVs into the
UFT.
Some projects have initiated this extension. For
instance, in National Renewable Energy Laboratory,
the performance of the heavy-duty HEVs and the
medium-duty PHEVs have been evaluated in retail
and express/post market [107]. Additionally, FREVUE
project has demonstrated light-, medium-, and heavyduty BEVs in entire five markets of UFT [108, 109].

For the ECV-UFT combinations, whose feasibility
has been studied in the literature, the future research
may focus on shifting the attention to the exploration
of possible solutions in the perspectives of logistics,
vehicles, and stakeholders. In other words, after
confirming the feasibility of some ECV-UFT
combinations, the studies about these ECV-UFT
combinations may step into other areas of focus
concerning the possible solutions to facilitate the
market penetration.
Similarly, after extending the ECV-UFT
combinations and examining the feasibility of these
non-existing ECV-UFT combinations in the literature,
the future research may focus on adapting the logistics
and vehicle concepts regarding these extended ECVUFT combinations. In these two areas, the existing
logistics and vehicle concepts are adapted to fit the
context of diverse ECV-UFT combinations. These
innovative adaptions may provide possible solutions
to encourage researchers and practitioners taking
into consideration the employment of ECVs in UFT.
Besides, the solutions for supporting stakeholders
(policy makers, freight operators, or grid managers),
such as incentives, practical methodologies, and new
business models, may also a potential perspective for
future research.
As a part of possible solutions for supporting
stakeholders, the future research may focus on the
assessment and selection of the satisfactory match
between the feasible ECV-UFT combinations. As stated
in section 2.3, although some works [8, 50] considered
the diverse types of ECVs and various requirements
of markets in UFT, appropriate methodologies for
assessing the diverse ECV-UFT combinations and
selecting the satisfactory match have not been proposed
and discussed yet. Accordingly, to increase the market
penetration of ECVs, the extension of ECV-UFT
combinations in the four areas of focus as well as the
assessment of the diversity to obtain the satisfactory
match between the ECVs and the UFT are primary
future research work.

6	CONCLUSION

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS

This paper provides an overview of the literature
addressing the employment of ECVs in UFT. It
focuses primarily on the diversity, which results from
the match between diverse types of ECVs and various
delivery tasks in UFT. This diversity is denoted as
ECV-UFT combinations in this paper. The goal of the
present paper is to explore the significance of studying
such diversity for increasing the market penetration
of ECVs. To achieve this goal, a systematic literature
review is applied. This review involves identifying the
primary areas of focus and the extent of the diversity
in the literature.
According to the topics and issues addressed in
the literature, reviewed articles fall into four areas of
focus, which are the feasibility of ECVs, adaptions of
logistics concepts, adaptions of vehicle concepts, and
support of stakeholders. In addition, by observing the
number of articles in each area within a decade, the
attention of studying the employment of ECVs in UFT
is shifting from examining the feasibility of ECVs to
the exploration of possible solutions in the perspectives
of logistics, vehicles, and stakeholders. In spite of this,
the diversity in the employment of ECVs in UFT has
been overlooked in these existing works.
The number of existing ECV-UFT combinations
is accordingly calculated to indirectly present the
extent of the diversity in the literature. The results
show little consideration on potentials underlying
diversity in the employment of ECVs in UFT. This
little diversity may be among factors impacting the
market penetration of ECVs on account of lacking a
comprehensive view. This incomprehensive view may
result in a hesitation of decision-makers to consider the
employment of ECVs in UFT. Given these points, the
present paper has contributed to proposing the concept
regarding the diversity, reviewing the state of the art
in the employment of ECVs in UFT, and presenting
the significance of the diversity for obtaining the
satisfactory match to increase the market penetration.
Although these insights are deduced by means of a
strict scientific methodology, it is acknowledged that
this review in this emerged research field may not be
exhausted. The reason for this non-exhausted review is
that some works in academic databases may have been
omitted, when we conducted this review.
For the future research, it is worth paying attention on
the diversity by extending the ECV-UFT combinations in
the four areas of focus. For the ECV-UFT combinations,
which have not been studied in the literature yet, the
future research may focus on examining the feasibility
of these ECV-UFT combinations. After increasing the
understanding on the feasibility of the majority of ECVUFT combinations, the future research may rank the
feasibility of the ECV-UFT combinations. For the high
ranked ECV-UFT combinations, the future research
may step into the exploration of possible solutions in
the perspectives of logistics, vehicles, and stakeholders.
