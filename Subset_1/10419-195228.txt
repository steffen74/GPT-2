
Global warming is a particularly thorny externality because it is global and its
effects extend for many decades into the future. To complicate matters even more, it
has heterogeneous effects around the world. It requires a level of effort and
commitment from the international community that is unparalleled in history, its
consequences are potentially disastrous, and it is plagued with uncertainties.
While the physical mechanism that links greenhouse gases to global warming is
clear and records show that the concentration of greenhouse gases has been
increasing in the atmosphere for the last two centuries, a long list of scientiﬁc
uncertainties makes it difﬁcult to assess precisely how much warming will result
from a given increase in greenhouse gas concentrations, when such warming will
occur, or how it will affect different regions and ecosystems.
To address these concerns, the United Nations and the World Meteorological
Organization established an international body—the Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change (IPCC)—to assess the scientiﬁc knowledge on climate change.
Projecting future climate trends is a complex endeavor. To cope with these
complexities, the IPCC produced a set of emissions scenarios. Each scenario
provides an alternative and internally consistent picture of how world development
might shape future emission trends. Taking into account these scenarios, along with
uncertainty about emissions and climate-system response, projected twenty-ﬁrst
century warming ranges from 1.1 to 6.4 °C (IPCC 2007). Thus, while the magnitude
of global warming that might occur in the future is indeed highly uncertain, all these
scenarios agree on its upward direction.
Just as the effects of global warming on the climate system are uncertain, the
physical and socioeconomic implications of climate change are not fully
understood. Thus, uncertain physical risks are compounded by uncertain natural
and socioeconomic consequences. Uncertainty about the effects of climate change
and how to cope with them is also compounded by uncertainty about its cost. Costs
are unknown due to possible changes in the available technology, the existence of
irreversibilities in some policies that cope with the problem, and the presence of
nonmarket goods and services that are vulnerable to climate change. In short,
uncertainty is the single most important attribute of climate change as a policy
problem.
A central concept in analyzing the effects of climate change is whether a system
can be managed. The nonagricultural sectors of high-income countries are highly
managed and this feature will allow them to better adapt to climate change.
However, human and natural systems that are unmanaged or unmanageable are
highly vulnerable. These systems include rain-fed agriculture, seasonal snow packs,
coastal communities, river runoffs, and natural ecosystems. Thus, the potential
damage of climate change is likely to be most heavily concentrated in low-income
and tropical regions such as tropical Africa, Latin America, coastal states, and the
Indian subcontinent.
The economics of climate change is simple. When we burn fossil fuels we emit
not pay for that privilege, and those who are harmed are not compensated. One
major lesson from economics is that unregulated markets cannot efﬁciently deal
with harmful externalities. Any solution needs substantial reductions in the
emissions of CO2 into the atmosphere. An obvious instrument to achieve that goal is
to raise the market price of those emissions. Raising the price on carbon will achieve
four goals. First, it will provide signals to consumers to reduce the consumption of
goods and services that are carbon-intensive. Second, it will provide signals to
producers to substitute away from inputs that are carbon-intensive. Third, it will
provide market incentives to innovate and adopt new low-carbon products and
process. Fourth, a carbon price will economize on the information that is required to
undertake all these tasks (Nordhaus 2008).
Rapid technological change in the energy sector is central to the transition to a
low-carbon economy. Current low-carbon technologies cannot substitute for fossil
fuels without a substantial economic penalty on carbon emissions. Developing
economical low-carbon technologies will lower the cost of achieving climate goals.
Therefore, governments and the private sector must intensively pursue low-carbon
or even noncarbon technologies.
There are, of course, other actions that can be taken to manage the problem of
global warming. Some of these actions are best performed by governments, while
others are best undertaken by private agents acting on their own, such as adapting
production practices to a changed climate. A general typology classiﬁes these
actions into mitigation and adaptation. Mitigation focuses directly on reducing the
amount of greenhouse gases released into the atmosphere (thus assuming that
human activity is partly responsible for the issue), while adaptation deals with
increasing resilience to the consequences of climate change.
Developed countries, which are better prepared to cope with climate change,
have stressed the importance of mitigation in order to limit temperatures to a range
between 2 and 3 °C above preindustrial levels depending upon costs, participation
rates, and discounting. Achieving such an objective will require a mitigation effort
that is global in scope. International agreements should provide incentives to
encourage participation, but the cost of those incentives should also be taken into
account. To date there are no such agreements.
This paper argues that in the absence of binding international agreements that
limit the levels of carbon emissions, Latin America should mainly focus on
adaptation to cope with climate change consequences. The paper also argues that the
region should implement traditional development policies that increase resilience to
climate change but that are also welfare-improving in the absence of climate change
(also known as ‘‘nonregret’’ policies). Only in the presence of a global binding
agreement like that mentioned in the previous paragraph would the region engage
seriously in mitigation. In that case, Latin America could exploit its comparative
advantage in the conservation and management of forests, which are a large carbon
sink. Finally, deciding which policies to implement depends on the results of
thorough cost–beneﬁt analysis of competing projects. Such cost–beneﬁt analyses
what has been suggested to overcome them. Section 3 then presents a list of
available policies that have been proposed to address climate change, divided into
three broad categories: adaptation, mitigation, and development policies that
increase countries’ adaptive capacity. Section 4 presents a theoretical framework,
and Sect. 5 provides a framework for evaluating different policies by their costeffectiveness so that policymakers can efﬁciently choose the ones that should be
implemented. Section 6 looks at the agricultural sector, an unmanaged system that
has long been assumed to be able to adapt autonomously, while Sect. 7 will
concentrate on forestry, a sector on which the region should focus in the event that
appropriate incentives for emissions reduction are put in place. The ﬁnal section
summarizes and draws conclusions in order to propose the direction for future
research.

2 Global warming and its potential effects
According to various sources (IPCC 2007; NOAA 2012; NASA 2012), the average
global temperature has increased nearly 1 °C since data started to be systematically
recorded in 1880. Despite the huge differences across regions, the upward trend has
affected the entire planet. Working Group II of the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report
compiled more than 500 studies that support these ﬁgures, and stresses that average
global warming accelerated between 1970 and 2004, and that since then the slope
has become ﬂat (2007). Most of these studies concluded that global warming has
affected physical as well as biological systems. In Latin America, different studies
point to an average increase of mean surface temperature of nearly 0.10 °C per
decade during the last century, but studies that focus on the second half of the
century ﬁnd an even higher increase per decade (IPCC 2007).
One may thus wonder what could have caused this trend. Unfortunately, the exact
causes and their relative contribution to global warming are not yet fully understood.
Uncertainty over global warming is the rule rather than the exception, although the
‘‘greenhouse effect’’ was documented as early as the nineteenth century by physicist
John Tyndall. Some gases in the atmosphere prevent heat from escaping into space,
keeping the earth warm. The most prominent greenhouse gas in the atmosphere is
water vapor, but it is followed by carbon dioxide (CO2), a byproduct of fossil-fuel
combustion1 the presence of which has experienced its largest increase in the last
century. The inclusion of data on greenhouse gas emissions in climate models yields
a substantially better ﬁt of observed climatic trends up to 2000. Following these facts,
the IPCC concluded in its fourth Assessment Report that ‘‘…most of the observed
increase in global average temperatures since the mid-twentieth century is very likely
due to the observed increase in anthropogenic greenhouse gas concentration’’ (IPCC
2007, 9). Nevertheless, the correlation between greenhouse gas emissions and
temperature cannot yet be given a conclusive causal interpretation. Moreover,
1

For a more detailed review of the greenhouse effect and the absorption rates of different gases, see
half of the twentieth century, in the last decade temperatures have stabilized,
although at record levels (NOAA 2012). At the same time, the amount of greenhouse
gases (particularly CO2 concentration in the atmosphere) has never stopped rising
and is at now at record highs (Scripps Institution of Oceanography 2015) . Scientists
have not yet been able to explain this phenomenon, although possible explanations
being investigated include a greater concentration of ash from volcanic eruptions and
reduced levels of solar activity.
Uncertainty is exacerbated when we move one step further and try to assess the
projected effects of climate change on the environment and the economy. First,
projecting future scenarios using climatic models that include greenhouse gas
emissions involves making assumptions in relation to population and economic
growth and technological change, among other factors. Second, the mechanisms
through which global warming will affect the environment are still subject to
controversy, and this controversy expands as scientists collect more information and
discover new ‘‘unknown unknowns’’ that could affect or be affected by global
warming (Victor 2011).
Despite all the uncertainty, however, there is scientiﬁc consensus that the upward
trend in global temperature will prevail. If this is correct, then moderate (but not
extreme) warming would actually bring global net beneﬁts, although unevenly
distributed: while countries at higher latitudes are expected to beneﬁt, those closer
to the equator will be worse off. However, researchers believe that warming beyond
2 °C will be costly in the aggregate (IPCC 2007).
Temperature increases are reducing and may continue to reduce glaciers,
producing many different adverse effects. A modest rate of ice-sheet melting
(mainly in Greenland and West Antarctica) is expected to accelerate the pace of
rises in sea levels reaching 2.2 m by the end of the century. Thus, low-lying and
coastal areas (where about a ﬁfth of the world population lives) will be at increased
risk. Moreover, a reduction of inter-tropical glaciers is expected in the Andean
region during this century. This may increase river ﬂow in the short run, but reduce
water availability in the long run and change the availability of water throughout the
year, probably affecting energy supply. This has already been evidenced in Bolivia,
Peru, Colombia, and Ecuador.
The effect on energy requirements is nevertheless uncertain. If temperatures rise,
less energy for heating will be needed, but higher cooling consumption should be
expected. This would produce a shift from fossil fuels to electricity, but the net
effect will depend on each country’s energy sources.
The overall effects of global warming on agriculture are uncertain. According to
the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report, food production will increase if temperatures
rise from 1 to 3 °C because infertile, high-latitude lands (mainly in Canada, northern
Europe, and Russia) will become productive. The increased amount of CO2 in the
atmosphere also allows crops to grow faster. However, dry and low-latitude regions
may suffer from a decrease in crop yields, and increases beyond the 3 °C threshold
will reduce overall crop production. Although economic development may
drastically reduce the number of undernourished people, there is concern that
is troublesome, costing these effects is even more difﬁcult. The way to cost
nonmarket goods—such as damage to or disappearance of ecosystem services, and
loss of species or human lives—has not yet been agreed upon. Table 1 presents a list
of studies carried out during the last two decades on the costing issue.
The available estimates of surface air temperature in the literature are similar
among them because they are based on climatic models that expect the
concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere to double by the end of the
century. In contrast, impact estimates (which reﬂect the yearly income reduction for
the estimated temperature increase) vary greatly from one study to another, and
even within studies carried out by the same researcher, because they are obtained
using a variety of approaches and including a different number of sectors.
With the exception of Mendelsohn et al. (2000) and Nordhaus (2006), all the
other studies use the ‘‘enumerative method’’ to estimate the effects of global
warming. This means that physical effects are obtained from other disciplines
(mainly natural science) that use climate and impact models, as well as laboratory
experiments. For example, researchers use agronomy papers to estimate the impact
of climate on crop yields, and then put a price on those effects using market prices
or economic models. This is the case for every market good and service that is
expected to be sensitive to climate change. For nonmarket goods and services (such
as health), pricing comes from the valuation of those same goods and services in
contexts different from climate change. As an example, suppose researchers assume
that a natural reserve will disappear as a consequence of climate change. A reserve
may have a recreational as well as an environmental value (absorption of CO2,
shelter for animals, etc.), but this value may be difﬁcult and/or expensive to
estimate. In order to do so, researchers use the cost estimates obtained from a study
in which the source of variation in a reserve similar to the one under study is not
climate.

Climate change in Latin America and the Caribbean:

Abstract Although climate change is ﬁlled with uncertainties, a broad set of
policies proposed to address this issue can be grouped in two categories: mitigation
and adaptation. Developed countries that are better prepared to cope with climate
change have stressed the importance of mitigation, which ideally requires a global
agreement that is still lacking. This paper uses a theoretical framework to argue that
in the absence of a binding international agreement on mitigation, Latin America
should focus mainly on adaptation to cope with the consequences of climate change.
This is not a recommendation that such economies indulge in free-riding. Instead, it
is based on cost–beneﬁt considerations, all else being equal. Only in the presence of
a global binding agreement can the region hope to exploit its comparative advantage
in the conservation and management of forests, which are a large carbon sink. The
decision of which policies to implement should depend on the results of a thorough
cost–beneﬁt analysis of competing projects, yet very little is known or has been
carried out in this area to date. Research should be directed toward cost–beneﬁt
analysis of alternative climate change policies. Policymakers should compare other
investments that are also pressing in the region, such as interventions to reduce
water and air pollution, and determine which will render the greatest beneﬁts.
