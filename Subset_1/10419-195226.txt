Most of the world’s population today lives in cities. However, this has been true
only since 2007, when the urban population surpassed the rural population due both
to natural growth of the urban population as well as accelerated rural migration to
cities (United Nations 2009; Henderson 2002). The global urbanization process was
mainly driven by the developing world, where the urban population grew at 3.35 %

1 % (United Nations 2009).
By 2011, 53 % of the world’s population lived in cities, including 80 % of the
population in the developed world and 46 % of the population in developing
countries. However, Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) is an outlier among
lower- and middle-income regions, with a strikingly high urbanization rate of
79 %—higher even than the urbanization rate of many member countries of the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
Rural to urban migration is driven by the expectation of better opportunities and
living standards. In cities, residents and ﬁrms enjoy the beneﬁts of agglomeration
and economies of scale as well as network effects, all of which increase labor
productivity and reduce the per capita cost of providing urban services (Rauch
1993).
Yet, the expected beneﬁts of living in cities do not materialize for all. The rapid
and unplanned expansion of cities has resulted in the growth of informal
settlements, which develop because governments are unable to provide urban
services for the growing population and because the formal housing market and
transport networks cannot meet the new demands. A large proportion of the urban
poor in developing countries live in urban or peri-urban areas under conditions of
overcrowding, insecure property rights, deﬁcient urban and social services, poverty,
and exposure to crime and violence, among other socioeconomic problems.
Consequently, migration to urban areas moved the location of global poverty to the
cities, triggering the process known as the ‘‘urbanization of poverty’’ (UN-Habitat
2003). In LAC, approximately 60 % of the poor and half of the extreme poor live in
urban areas. The urbanization of poverty is projected to continue in the region,
particularly in certain areas such as Central America (Fay 2005).
Slums represent a major challenge to development given the deﬁcient provision
of urban services to them, the lack of public safety, and environmental hazards. In
addition, the geographical and social segregation of slum dwellers accentuates bad
peer effects and sometimes inﬂicts a stigma on slum dwellers that prevents them
from joining the formal labor market.
Thus, programs to avoid new informal settlements and to stop the growth of
existing ones should be of ﬁrst-order importance on the LAC research and policy
agenda. Also, governments need to urgently ﬁnd solutions to integrate the actual
slum dwellers into the formal city and solve the urban divide.
This paper identiﬁes the main problems in housing and urban infrastructure in
LAC and reviews the causal effect of past interventions within urban infrastructure
programs in the region. The ultimate goal is to understand what has worked in terms
of housing and transport and to detect gaps in knowledge to promote avenues for
future research for a more sustainable urbanization process.
The paper looks to explore what drives the decisions of households in terms of
consumption of household services and location within a city—decisions that, in
turn, shape urban patterns. Many urban poor cannot afford formal housing or are
conﬁned to live in substandard conditions close to the city center because transport
access to the formal housing market and improvement of the public transit network.
The rationale for these ﬁrst two priorities is based on the fact that the rapid and
unplanned urbanization of LAC distorted the equilibrium of housing supply and
demand, and to date that equilibrium has not been restored. There are market
failures in the formal housing market for the poor that prevent or delay this
adjustment. At the same time, in the developing world mass public transport is
deﬁcient, which affects the living standards of the urban poor. It is therefore clear
that the integration of formal housing supply and mass public transit policies are the
key elements to shape more sustainable cities in the future and accommodate the
still growing urban population.
Slums could be viewed as a ﬁrst step in the move to the city. Inner slums are
located close to the city center and might be a strategic starting point for newly
arrived poor migrants to look for a job and explore opportunities. However, as can
be seen in LAC, slums tend to be a permanent rather than a transitory phenomenon.
Therefore, the third policy priority explored in this paper is slum upgrading to
improve the living standards of slum dwellers and mitigate urban poverty.
Although the urban poverty problem is multi-causal and requires a cross-sectoral
approach, including citizen security and health for example, the scope of this paper
is limited to the main barriers to the integration of the urban poor in terms of
housing and transport. Other important socioeconomic and environmental problems
related to the urban poor are excluded from the analysis.
When studying the causal effects of interventions, identiﬁcation issues are of the
ﬁrst order of relevance. We include mainly papers that exploit experimental or
quasi-experimental settings.1 Those methods have proven to be the most accurate
for causal inference. Nevertheless, we also include important observational studies
or qualitative evaluations when more rigorous evaluations are not yet available.
Most of the programs reviewed take place in the developing world, with priority
given to LAC, unless there is no information available for developing regions, in
which case relevant papers from other regions are included.
In terms of the ﬁrst priority area, there is scant knowledge on the best way to
expand the supply of housing for the poor and promote the rental market in LAC for
low-income households. There is, however, a body of literature with sound
identiﬁcation strategies on formalizing urban poor by giving them land titles.
The second policy priority is to improve transport networks for the poor. The
most urgent area for future research is to ﬁnd ways to make mass public transit
accessible and affordable for the poor and to investigate how this can shape the
spatial patterns of the city. Policies that integrate transport reforms with supply of
housing for low-income households seem the most promising
Finally, for informal settlements, there are many papers investigating the effect
of slum upgrading programs. Proposals that involve a single intervention to improve
the living standards of the urban poor have improved the level of satisfaction of
1

In experimental settings, the treated and control groups are randomly selected. In quasi-experimental
designs, a variety of statistical methods is employed to choose a control group that can re-create the
of slum dwellers. It seems that integral slum upgrading programs are necessary to
produce more profound and long-lasting changes. Rigorous evaluation of integral
programs will be very useful to determine which mix of programs produces the best
outcomes.
The rest of the document is structured as follows: Section 2 sets the region in the
context of the world in terms of a wide range of housing and transport indicators.
Section 3 develops a simple spatial equilibrium approach that serves as a theoretical
framework to understand housing choices. Section 4 studies a set of programs
within the main selected policy areas: (1) access to housing, (2) transport
interventions, and (3) upgrading housing. Finally, Sect. 5 presents conclusions that
point out avenues for future research.

2 Housing and urban infrastructure in Latin America
and the Caribbean
The trend from rural to urban populations occurred earlier in developed regions and
is now the main trend in the developing world. Population growth is, therefore,
becoming largely an urban phenomenon concentrated in the developing world
(Satterthwaite 2007). Table 1 shows that among developing regions, LAC has an
exceptionally high level of urbanization (79 %) that is higher than that of Europe.

respective populations living in cities. In the years ahead, the level of urbanization is
expected to increase in all major areas of the developing world, with Africa and
Asia urbanizing more rapidly than the rest. Nevertheless, by mid-century, Africa
and Asia are still expected to have lower levels of urbanization than the more
developed regions or LAC (United Nations 2013).
Table 1 illustrates the urban explosion that took place in LAC from 1950 to 1990.
In 1950, only 40 % of the population in LAC lived in cities, while in 1990 that
proportion reached 70 %. In 2011, the urbanization rate was 79 %, and by 2050, it is
expected to rise to 90 % (United Nations 2013).
Not only is LAC the most urbanized developing region, it also has a high degree
of concentration of the population in large cities. Table 1 shows that 35 % of the
urban population lives in metropolitan areas of more than 1 million people, which is
the highest proportion in the world. LAC also has the largest concentration of megacities in the world. In 1950, there were no mega-cities in the region. Today, there are
˜
eight: Buenos Aires, Mexico City, Rio de Janeiro, and Sao Paulo (all with more than
10 million inhabitants), and Belo Horizonte, Bogota, Lima, and Santiago
(approaching 10 million inhabitants). While 9 % of the world population lives in
cities with more than 10 million inhabitants, in LAC 14 % lives in such mega-cities
(UN-Habitat 2012). There are also 55 cities in LAC with populations between 1 to 5
million people, and these cities account for 24 % of the regional population (the
world average is 22 % for this city size). These cities include Caracas, Guatemala
City, Panama City, San Salvador, and Brasilia. As a result of this rapid urbanization
over the years, mega-cities expanded exponentially and new smaller cities also
emerged.
This striking level of urbanization and urban agglomeration in LAC is a
challenge for the cities that were not prepared to absorb such population growth. As
a consequence, the slum population increased in recent decades, with a modest
decrease only during the past few years.2 Figure 1 shows that in 2010 there were
828 million slum dwellers in the developing world (one-sixth of the world’s
population), 110 million of whom lived in LAC. The proportion of the urban
population living in slums has been decreasing thanks to the rapid rate of
urbanization that more than offset the increase in slum dwellers.
One of the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) is ‘‘cities without slums’’.3 To
date, 200 million people living in cities have stopped being considered as living in

According to UN-Habitat (2003), a slum household is a group of individuals living under the same roof
and lacking one or more of the following conditions: (1) access to safe water: sufﬁcient amount of water
(20 l/person/day), at an affordable price (less than 10 % of total household income), available without
being subject to extreme effort (less than 1 h a day of walking time); (2) access to improved sanitation:
access to an excreta disposal system either in the form of a private toilet or a public toilet shared with a
reasonable number of people; (3) sufﬁcient living area: fewer than three people per habitable room; (4)
structural quality/durability of dwellings: a house built on a nonhazardous location and with a permanent
structure adequate to protect its inhabitants from the extremes of climatic conditions; and (5) security of
tenure: the right to effective protection by the State against arbitrary unlawful evictions.

The 11th MDG target is to progress toward a goal of ‘‘Cities Without Slums’’ (within the 7th Goal of
‘‘Ensuring Environmental Sustainability’’), establishing a target of improving the lives of at least 100

Note Indicator 7.10 to monitor the Millennium Development Goal Target 7.D is: by 2020 to have
achieved a signiﬁcant improvement in the lives of at least 100 million slum-dwellers. Slum population is
deﬁned as the urban population living in dwellings with at least one of these four characteristics: lack of
access to improved drinking water, lack of access to improved sanitation, overcrowding (three or more
persons per room) and dwellings made of nondurable material. Half of pit latrines are considered
improved sanitation. Trends data are not available for Oceania

slums because they gained access to water and sanitation facilities and durable
housing. As a consequence, from 2000 to 2010, the proportion of urban residents in
developing countries living in slums decreased from 46 to 36 %. However, progress is
still insufﬁcient, as the number of people moving to slums is increasing in many
regions (UN-Habitat 2011). In LAC, around 25 % of the urban population lives in
slums.
There are two MDGs closely related to cities without slums: access to safe water
and sanitation services. The MDG to halve by 2015 the population without access to
safe water with respect to 1990 will be achieved. In particular, LAC has a high level
of coverage (Table 2). However, the MDG to halve by 2015 the population without
access to sanitation services with respect to 1990 will not be achieved globally,
despite large improvements in many regions. In LAC, the provision of sanitation is

deﬁcits in urban areas of LAC: around 21 million households live in dwellings
lacking at least one basic service. Inadequate sanitation is the main infrastructure
problem, affecting 13 % of households (almost 17 million). Around 8 million
households lack piped water (and the quality of the water received by most
households is not optimal). The urban poor are the most affected: in 2009, the
percentage of poor households lacking infrastructure was six times higher than that
of high-income households. While there is almost no overcrowding or poor-quality
building materials in high-income households, these problems affect 16 % of urban
poor households (Bouillon 2012).
Tables 3 and 4 show the differential access to urban services of the ﬁrst quintile
(20 % poorest) of the income distribution with respect to the mean. This would
indicate that more pro-poor and targeted polices are needed.
Access to housing is the main problem for new urban migrants. There are scant
cross-regional statistics on home ownership, but in LAC the home ownership rates
are higher on average than in the rest of the developing world (Bouillon 2012).
Table 5 shows large disparities among countries of the region according to
household income: Nicaragua, Venezuela, Costa Rica, and Panama have home
ownership rates of more than 70 % for urban households, while Uruguay and Brazil
have rates lower than 55 %. The lowest income quintile has ownership rates far
below the mean in Uruguay, Mexico, and Brazil. The rental sector is not developed
in the region for low-income residents, so access to housing is a main policy
priority. Rental tenure rates in LAC are even lower than in other developing
countries in Africa and Asia (Andreasen 1996; Gilbert et al. 1997).
The last topic addressed in this paper is transport systems, which are a pillar for
economic development and growth. Within cities, the availability and quality of
transportation shapes spatial patterns and is tightly linked to the supply of housing
services. When there is an inﬂux of migrants in cities with deﬁcient public transit
networks, the poor have to live close to their jobs in the city center with deﬁcientquality housing (inner-city slums), or in the suburbs, spending a lot of time and
money commuting. Also, as in the housing sector, in areas not reached by formal
public transport, informal suppliers emerge to meet the demand for transportation at
very high prices.
Although transport is important, no target for transport was included in the
MDGs, and there are few statistics to make international comparisons. Thus, we use
different sources, including certain statistics published by the World Bank, data
from some relevant cities, and a mobility index developed by a private company.
Figure 2 shows the Little (2014) Urban Mobility Index for a sample of 84 cities
across the world. This index reﬂects the state of mobility in terms of maturity and
performance.4 Western Europe ranks highest among all regions surveyed, followed
by South/Eastern Europe. These regions lead both in the mobility and the maturity
components of the index. North America scores below average due to its high

The mobility score per city ranges from 0 to 100 index points; the maximum of 100 points is deﬁned by
the best performance of any city in the sample for each criterion. See Little (2014) for a detailed

dependence on cars. The average score of the cities of LAC included in the sample5
is also slightly below the world average, due to relatively low mobility performance.
Figure 3 shows the mean number of daily trips per person and mode of transport.
In Europe, on average 40 % of the trips use individual motorized transport, 24 %
use public transport, and 36 % walk or cycle. There is a lot of heterogeneity among
the cities: for example, in London the use of public transport accounts for 42 % of
trips, while in Amsterdam 58 % of the trips are by walking or (especially) cycling.
In LAC, motorization is very high (28 % of trips are in private cars or taxis) but the
largest number of trips (42 %) is by public transport.
Table 6 presents more comprehensive statistics for all LAC countries. It shows
that LAC is one of the most motorized regions of the world, but does not rank so
high in terms of transportation infrastructure (low road density and very low
percentage of paved roads). As incomes in the region increased and private vehicles
became relatively cheaper, more middle- and high-income individuals had access to
cars. There was indeed exponential growth of motorization in the region, similar to
the trend experienced earlier in the developed world but much faster (Cervero et al.
2013). In 2010, there were 183 motor vehicles per 1000 inhabitants in LAC, more
than the world average of 176 and almost 4 times more than the average for lowand middle-income countries. Also in LAC in 2010 there were 2.5 new motor
vehicle registrations for every new child born (Hidalgo and Huizenga 2013).

Motorization results in congestion, air pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions. In
addition, motorization reduces the physical activity implied by nonmotorized modes
of transport (cycling and walking), which in turn increases obesity and related
illnesses. Costs of negative externalities are estimated to be around 18 % of the
average income of 15 selected cities in the region (Hidalgo and Huizenga 2013).
Clearly, cars are not affordable for all in LAC. Table 6 shows that in most
countries in the region the probability of having a car when belonging to the ﬁfth
income quintile (20 % richest) is more than 10 times higher than for the ﬁrst income

ownership. Consequently, the urban poor rely strongly on public mass transport or
nonmotorized transport (walking and cycling).
In many cities in LAC public mass transport is deﬁcient. The coverage of metro
lines and availability of passenger cars is very low in the region in comparison with
developed cities (Fig. 4; Table 6).6
The cheapest mass public transport is the bus (CAF-OMU 2009), and it is used
widely in LAC. However, the cost of bus fares (usually subsidized) consumes a
signiﬁcant proportion of the income of the poor. Figure 5 shows the cost of 50 bus
rides as a percentage of a month’s minimum salary for selected LAC cities, New York,
and London. In LAC those earning the minimum wage (or less) spend 16 % (or more)
of their salary on transport, while in New York and London that ﬁgure is around 5 %.
So the burden of transportation on the expenses of the poor is very high in LAC.
From this section it can be concluded that LAC is an outlier among developing
regions for its high urbanization rate. The region has many deﬁcits with respect to
housing and transport. Inequality in access to urban services is very high in some
countries. Therefore, polices should facilitate access to the formal housing market and
quality housing services for the poor. There seems to be an imperative need to improve
mobility in LAC cities. Deﬁcient public transit disproportionally affects the urban poor,
as it hinders their socioeconomic development and conditions their housing choices.

3 Theoretical framework
This section employs a simple city model to provide a conceptual framework for the
discussion on housing and transport infrastructure. We employ the traditional spatial
Alonso–Mills–Muth framework (AMM) (Alonso 1964; Mills 1972; Muth 1969).

The basic idea of the AMM model is that cities have a central business district
where residents work.7 To focus on residential housing choices, we assume that the
central business district is collapsed to a single point at the city center (takes up no
space).
There is a dense network of radial roads that are used daily by the residents to
commute from home to work in the central business district. Let x be the distance
from the house to the city center. Households are identical, of size one, and earn
the same income working in the central business district (later we introduce
heterogeneity). They consume a basket of two goods: c is consumption of a
composite nonhousing good and q is consumption of units of housing services.
This is a rental model, so q refers to rented housing services.8 Most models use
q as the area of the housing good consumed (square meters of the house rented),
but we interpret q as a unit that measures housing services that is both the
quantity and quality of the house (material of ﬂoors and walls, sanitation and
water services, security of tenure, and other housing amenities). There is a level qs
below which a dwelling is considered substandard (for example, think of qs as the
threshold below which a household lives in a slum according to the criteria
described in Sect. 2).

7

Although the framework can be adapted to increasingly polycentric cities, it is also useful in terms of
the main trade-offs households face when choosing their location within the city.

8

A household chooses the composition of its consumption basket, given its budget
constraint, to achieve the maximum utility level possible. When choosing q, it will
also have to choose x (location). The utility function is U(c, q), strictly quasiconcave.
Each household earns an income y working in the central business district and
incurs transport costs T(x) that increase with the radial distance x from the central
business district.9 Commuting costs have two parts: the monetary cost (gasoline and
car expenses or public transport fare) and the opportunity cost of the time spent
commuting. For now we only include monetary costs and assume that there is only
one transport technology.
After paying transport costs, the disposable income is y - T(x), to be spent on
nonhousing consumption c and on housing services q. The price of the composite
nonhousing good is assumed to be the same everywhere and is set to be equal to
US$1. The price of housing services is p(x).
There is a maximum utility level that can be achieved by every household.
Following Brueckner (1987), when substituting for nonhousing consumption in the
budget constraint, the condition that the maximized utility equals U is
maxðqÞ vðy À TðxÞ À pðxÞq; qÞ ¼ U:

ð1Þ

The condition for locational equilibrium states that all the residents should have
the same level of utility in their locations. Otherwise, there are incentives to move to
other areas that give a higher utility. To achieve this, the price of the housing
services should vary according to the distance to the central business district.
Housing services close to the central business district are more expensive, which
offsets the expense that households located far away incur for commuting. This is a
very important prediction of the model.
More formally, from Eq. (1) we can establish two conditions to ﬁnd the solution
for the unknowns p and q for every given x, and the parameters. The ﬁrst-order
condition for q is
vq ðy À TðxÞ À pðxÞq; qÞ
¼ p:
vc ðy À TðxÞ À pðxÞq; qÞ

ð2Þ

The second condition is that the resulting consumption must give utility U:
vðy À TðxÞ À pðxÞq; qÞ ¼ U:

ð3Þ

There are multiple solutions for this system of equations. In Fig. 6 we can see
two possible ones. For utility level U1, at a given distance to the central business
district x1 we can plot a tangent budget constraint with intercept y - T(x1). The
absolute value of the resulting slope of the budget constraint will be the price of the
unit of housing services at that distance: p(x1). If now we consider rental housing

For example, if residents pay $t per kilometer, we can represent the commuting costs with a linear

services at a distance x0 (closer to the central business district), the intercept of the
budget constraint would be y - T(x0) and its slope p(x0) would be steeper, meaning
that closer to the city center (x0 \ x1) the price of housing services is more
expensive p(x0) [ p(x1).
Figure 6 already gives us a hint of the main relationships of interest: between p
and x, which determines the price schedule of housing services within the city, and
between q and x, which determines housing consumption within the city. We can get
an expression for both of them by totally differentiating the last equation with
respect to x and replacing vq(Á) = pvc(Á). This very important relationship is called
the bid-rent gradient and represents the main trade-off between the cost of housing
and transport:
op
Tx
¼À :
ox
q

ð4Þ

As the transport cost is an increasing function of the distance, the price of
housing services is a decreasing function of distance x to the central business district
(as shown in Fig. 6). Commuting cost differences within an urban area must be
balanced by differences in the price of housing services.10
The other important relationship is between x and q:

From Eq. (4) we can also deduce that as long as T(x) is concave, the house pricing curve is convex:
indifference curves, and the derivative of the price of housing services with respect
to the distance to the central business district is also negative (Eq. 4). This means
that the further one moves away from the central business district, the more housing
services one consumes.
3.2 Supply analysis
Brueckner (1987) provides one example for a supply-side analysis. In his
model, housing services q are restricted to the size of the house rented.
Building developers use a constant-returns-to-scale technology and there is free
entry into this market. The model provides two key insights: (1) the height of
buildings, and (2) the decrease in the rent of land according to the distance
from the central business district. As a direct implication, it can be derived that
population density also decreases with the distance away from the central
business district.
The main predictions of this simple model up to now are the following: (1) prices
of housing services decrease with the distance from the central business district to
offset the fact that households in suburban areas incur higher transport costs; (2)
households can consume more housing services far from the central business
district, (3) the rental prices of land also decrease with the distance from the central
business district to incentivize developers to build in suburban areas, and as a
consequence developers get spatially uniform zero proﬁts; (4) buildings are higher
close to the central business district; and (5) the closer to the central business
district, the higher the population density.
3.3 Extending the demand side to different income groups
Allowing for different income groups gives rise to different spatial sorting patterns
that strongly depend on individual preferences (from which we abstract) and
transportation costs. One interesting case is that of linear transportation costs,
T(x) = tx, which are the same for all income groups. In this context one can show
that the poor will live in the city center while the rich will move to the suburbs
(Fig. 7). The rationale is that the poor consume less housing services and thus
outbid the rich at locations closer to the central business district (see Hartwick et al.
1976 for inﬁnite income groups).
This result of the concentration of the poor in the city center is, however, very
sensitive to the assumption that transport costs are only monetary and all income
groups use the same transport technology.11 To see this formally, let there be two
income groups, the poor P and the rich R. The poor have income yP, the rich yR and
yR [ yP. Both the poor and the rich consume composite good ci and housing
services qi and i = R, P. Assume that there are two modes of transportation that
11

Differences in preferences can also affect the sorting. For example, Brueckner et al. (1999) show that
if the rich have preferences for amenities that are in the city center, such as historical buildings, they

both income groups can use: public transport (e.g., a bus), with ﬁxed cost fb,12
variable costs cb per kilometer, and opportunity cost tbyi per kilometer; or an
automobile, which causes ﬁxed cost fa, variable cost ca, and opportunity cost tayi.
We assume that the car is a more expensive mode of transportation than the bus, i.e.,
fa [ fb, ca [ cb, but is also faster, i.e., tb [ ta. An individual of group I, choosing
transport k 2 fb; ag; then faces the following maximization problem:
maxUðqi ; ci Þ s:t: yi À f k À ck x À tk yi x ! qi p þ ci :

ð6Þ

As before, rich and poor have to be indifferent between the locations they choose.
This is accomplished, in equilibrium, by the price being a decreasing function of the
distance to the central business district x. Indeed, an application of the envelope
theorem shows that the bid-rent gradient for an individual of group i using
transportation mode k is given by (like Eq. 6)

ð7Þ

It remains to investigate under which conditions members of the two groups use
public transport or decide to use a car. Let xÃ be the distance from the center where
i

12
The introduction of ﬁxed costs allows for a richer set of equilibria in that members of the same group
Clearly, xÃ solves the equation f a þ ca xÃ þ ta yi xÃ ¼ f b þ cb xÃ þ tb yi xÃ ; leading to

Whenever ca À cb þ ðta À tb Þyi \0; it is never optimal to use a car for a member
of income group i, while otherwise the use of a car is optimal for all locations x ! xÃ :
i
The sorting of the two different income groups depends on the means of transport
they use, as this determines the bid-rent gradient.13 Intuitively, the rich have a
comparative advantage with respect to the poor to live in the city center, as their
opportunity cost of time is higher. This comparative advantage is attenuated once
the rich have access to a car, which provides a more efﬁcient way of commuting. It
seems thus reasonable to assume that there may be some parameter values for which
the rich prefer to locate in the city center, whereas the poor live in suburban areas.
First, consider the case in which both income groups use public transport. The
rich will live in the city center, while the poor live in the suburban area, if and only
if the bid-rent gradient of the rich is steeper than the bid-rent gradient of the poor:
cb þ tb yR
cb þ t b yP
[
:
hR

ð9Þ


If this is the case, the rich will outbid the poor until some distance x from the
center. This condition is equivalent to saying that the elasticity of demand for
housing services with respect to income is less than the elasticity of the marginal
cost of transportation with respect to income (for empirical estimates of the
elasticities involved, see LeRoy and Sonstelie 1983; Glaeser et al. 2008).
On the other hand, suppose that xÃ (distance from the central business district
R
where the rich are indifferent between the two modes of transport) lies within the
city’s boundaries (but xÃ does not). Then the rich ﬁnd it optimal at some distance to
P
use the car. For the rich who use the car to live further from the center than the poor
who use the bus, the following condition has to hold:

Again this condition can be related to the elasticities of the demand of housing
services and marginal transportation costs with respect to income.
3.3.1 Spatial sorting
Consider a situation where the poor never ﬁnd it optimal to use a car, whereas the
rich do ﬁnd it best to use a car for distances x ! xÃ : Assume that Eqs. (9) and (10)
R
hold. Then, depending on the parameters, there are two possible equilibria: in one
13
We restrict attention to the demand side, in the spirit of LeRoy and Sonstelie (1983) and Glaeser et al.
bid-rent gradient is steeper when using the bus than the bid-gradient of the poor. The
rich prefer to live in the center as it minimizes their opportunity cost from
commuting. Around the rich center, there is a circle of poor who use the bus, which
is encircled by a suburban area inhabited by the rich with cars. The existence of this
latter layer is guaranteed by Eq. (10), which ensures that the bid-rent gradient of the
rich using a car exceeds the gradient of the poor using a bus for sufﬁciently far
locations.
A second possible equilibrium is one in which all the rich move away from the
city center and only the poor live there. Intuitively this will be the case when costs
for public transport are relatively high, which reduces the number of rich who want
to use public transport. In this case, the poor compete so ﬁercely for the city center
locations that all the rich prefer to move to suburban areas and use a car.
Figure 8 represents de price bid gradients for the different groups (subscripts)
and means of transport (superscripts). The equilibria described are Fig. 8a, b,
respectively.

We now consider how two alternative policy interventions affect the sorting of the
groups in the city and the consumption of housing services. We show that making
public transport more efﬁcient (e.g., by introducing a faster means of transport such
as a subway/train or rapid bus transport, or by lowering the price of the bus) can
induce the poor to live further from the central business district and therefore have
access to better housing services.
3.4.1 Introducing a more efﬁcient public means of transport
Suppose we are in a situation in which the poor live in the city center and use public
transport, whereas the rich live in the suburban area and use cars. Consider a
government intervention that introduces a new means of transport such as a subway
or rapid bus transport system (represented by c in Fig. 8c) that is both cheaper and
more efﬁcient than both the standard bus system and the car. In this case, both rich
and poor will use the same means of transport. If Eq. (9) holds—that is, the
elasticity of demand for housing services is less than the elasticity of the marginal
cost of transportation—the rich will relocate to the city center, whereas the poor will
live in suburban areas. This is due to the comparative advantage the rich hold
because of their higher opportunity costs.
3.4.2 Decreasing the cost of public transport
Consider again the situation in which the poor live in the city center and use the bus
only, whereas the rich live in suburban areas and use the car only. Lowering the cost
of the bus, will increase the distance xÃ that makes it worthwhile for the rich to use
R
the car, whereas the poor will still take the bus for any distance. Reducing
commuting costs for the poor will, ceteris paribus, lead to an increase in the demand
for housing services from the poor, as this is a normal good (and lowering the
transport cost for the poor is analogous to increasing their income). Consider then
the poor living at the boundary with the rich. Having a higher income and a higher
demand will increase the price bid for housing services at this location and thus the
poor will outbid the rich. This is true for some area around the boundary. As a
response, the rich at the boundary will be urged to move outward, thereby increasing
the price at these locations. There are then two possible outcomes of this change:
either the rich get concentrated in a smaller area of suburbia and suffer a utility loss
whereas the poor’s locations extend further from the center (Fig. 8d),14 or some of
the rich decide to relocate to the city center. Which of these two possibilities obtains
depends on the magnitude of the decrease of bus transport costs.

14

Following the framework of the previous section, when the expected income in
urban areas is higher than in rural areas, there will be an increase in the urban
population and the equilibrium of housing supply and demand will be distorted.
Excess demand for housing services will increase prices, which will in turn
incentivize builders to expand the housing supply to reach a new equilibrium in a
larger city.
There are market failures in the formal housing market for the poor that in reality
prevent or delay this adjustment. The proliferation of slums in LAC after the rapid
and unplanned urbanization of recent decades shows that there is a serious problem
in access to formal housing by low-income segments of the population. Thus,
formalization of the urban poor is the ﬁrst policy priority studied.
The model presented clearly shows the trade-off between the price of housing
services and transport costs. We also examined the importance of public transport
policies in shaping the spatial sorting of income groups and affecting their
consumption of housing services. If the public transit system is more efﬁcient and/or
affordable for the poor, according to the framework presented, we expect a
decentralization of this group that would increase their capacity to consume housing
services. Therefore, the second policy priority studied is improving transport
networks to achieve a more sustainable and equitable transport system.
Enhancing access to formal housing and improving public transport for the poor
can potentially avoid the formation of new slums and attenuate the growth of
existing ones. However, there are still millions of people living in slums, so the third
policy priority studied is slum upgrading to improve the living standard of people
living in informal settlements.
4.1 Housing
4.1.1 Access to formal housing
When the formal housing market cannot cope with a rapid increase in demand,
many poor migrants look for housing solutions in the informal market, including
owning or renting a house or subdivision of a dwelling built illegally on irregularly
developed land, or occupying land or dwellings in irregular places (usually in slums
or squatter settlements).
To understand why the poor cannot access the formal housing market, supply and
demand problems need to be considered. On the supply side, the private sector may
not respond if it lacks incentives to go down-market, either because it is less
proﬁtable than serving wealthier markets, and access to credit and capital is scarce,
or because there is unfair competition from informal land developers and from
people who build their own homes. In addition, there may be constraints on scale,
technology, or inputs (such as land availability), or regulation costs and taxes may
to transform demand for housing into effective demand, (2) the lack of satisfactory
guarantees to qualify for mortgage loans, and (3) the lack of documentation to prove
permanent earnings given that many low-income families work in the informal
sector.
Bouillon et al. (2012) study the demand side in a sample of cities in LAC. They
classify the affordability gap according to several constraints: low income, poverty
induced if buying a house, high interest rate of mortgages, lack of documents to
prove income, or high housing prices. They detect an overall gap of 43 % of
households in 41 LAC cities. Insufﬁcient income is the most common factor
preventing households from affording a house in the formal market. In the most
expensive cities, the main problem is the inability to document income and the high
prices of private sector dwellings. The interest rate does not seem to be an important
factor contributing to the affordability gap. Bouillon et al. (2012) show that the
˜
cities with the highest affordability gap are Caracas, Lima, Buenos Aires, Sao Paulo,
Santo Domingo, San Pedro Sula, Managua, Rio de Janeiro, Curitiba, and La Paz.
Policies promoting income growth and redistribution policies in cities with high
inequality are needed to mitigate the affordability constraint. Other solutions are
supply-side programs, such as public housing and subsidies, or demand-side
programs, such as housing allowances or cash transfers. Another alternative is to
promote the rental market, which is far less popular in LAC than in the OECD
countries.
The next section reviews the main policies applied to formalize low-income
households.
4.1.2 Land titling and property rights
A common characteristic of slum dwellers is that they live in houses with unsecure
property rights or they lack a title altogether. In the model, a house that has insecure
property rights is represented by a q lower than qs, where qs is the housing services
threshold below which a dwelling is considered substandard. This is a consequence
of the lack of planning for urban growth together with the inability of land and
mortgage markets to reach these populations. Besley and Ghatak (2009) classify
property rights into two types: use rights (the owner’s right to use a good or asset for
consumption and income generation, and transfer rights (the owner’s right to
transfer a good or asset to another party as a sale, gift, or bequest). When property
rights are effective, it means mainly that the ownership structures are well-deﬁned.
There are two main channels through which effective property rights can affect
economic development (De Soto 2001). The ﬁrst is by encouraging private housing
investments, as insecure property rights usually weaken the incentive for owners to
make long-term capital investments or to plan for the future. Also, secured tenure is
sometimes a precursor to public investment, since government agencies are more
likely to invest in extending public services (e.g., water, drainage, or sewerage
networks) once the dwellers regularize their temporary or illegal situation (Gulyani
and Talukdar 2008). The second channel is related to the income-generation
productive projects, increasing labor productivity and income, or in further housing
upgrades. The lack of property rights makes investments in untitled parcels highly
illiquid. Moreover, it prevents poor families from the possibility of having a
valuable insurance and savings tool that could provide protection during bad times
and retirement, forcing them instead to rely on extended family members and
offspring as insurance mechanisms (Galiani and Schargrodsky 2010).
In recent years, many governments throughout the developing world have
undertaken land-titling programs that mainly involved titling public (or sometimes
private) tracts of land to their current occupants (Galiani and Schargrodsky 2011).
The evaluation of the causal effects of property rights, however, is a difﬁcult task, as
their allocation is typically endogenous. Usually, the allocation of property rights is
not random but based on wealth, family characteristics, individual effort, previous
investment levels, or other mechanisms that make the groups that acquire those
rights different than those that do not. There is already a group of papers that
overcome this identiﬁcation problem by exploiting different quasi-experimental
designs or natural experiments that provide exogenous sources of variation in land
titles.
Galiani and Schargrodsky (2010) exploit a natural experiment in the allocation of
land titles in Argentina. In 1981, squatters occupied a piece of land in a poor
suburban area of Buenos Aires. In 1984, a law was passed expropriating the former
owners’ land in order to title the occupants. While some original owners accepted
the government compensation, others opted to dispute the compensation payment in
the Argentine courts, which are extremely slow. Both groups share the same
household pretreatment characteristics, live next to each other, and inhabit identical
parcels. Since the decision of the original owners to accept or dispute the
expropriation payment was uncorrelated to the squatter characteristics, these
different decisions by the former owners generated an exogenous allocation of
property rights across squatters.
The authors ﬁnd that families that received a title substantially increased housing
investments (for example, the constructed surface increased by 12 %, while an
overall index of housing quality rose by 37 %). Land titling also reduced household
size to an average of 5.11 members compared to 6.06 members for families still
living on untitled parcels. This was due to the fact that the titled households were
more nuclear families (less presence of extended family members), and because of
reduced fertility of the household heads. In addition, the children from the
households that reduced fertility show signiﬁcantly better educational achievement,
with an average of 0.69 more years of schooling and twice the completion rate of
secondary education (53 versus 26 %). No signiﬁcant impact on labor market
outcomes was found.
Regarding the impact of land titles on the credit market, the study found no
effects on access to credit cards and banking accounts or to nonmortgage formal
credit. Indeed, families in this area had very little access to formal credit (less than
10 % had access). Access to credit was higher for informal credit from relatives,
credits (only 4 % of the treated households had ever received a mortgage loan).
Another study of the effects of land titles using a quasi-experimental design is by
Field (2005), who exploited the variation in ownership status induced by a nationwide titling program in Peru in which 1.2 million property titles were distributed to
urban squatters on public land between 1996 and 2003. Making use of differences
across regions induced by the timing of the program and differences across target
populations in the level of pre-program ownership rights, Field performed a
difference-in-differences analysis comparing the change in housing investment
before and after the program among participating households with the change
among nonparticipants. Field constructed a panel using cross-sectional data with
retrospective questions. The results indicate that strengthening property rights in
urban slums had a signiﬁcant effect on residential investment: the rate of housing
renovation rose by more than two-thirds of the baseline level.
As in the case of Galiani and Schargrodsky (2010), Field (2005) found that the
greater incentives to invest were not associated with an improvement in credit
access due to the titling program, but rather to a reduced threat of eviction. In
particular, there was a signiﬁcant increase in renovations ﬁnanced out of pocket and
in total investment among nonborrowing households.
Field and Torero (2003) relied on matching methods for their identiﬁcation
strategy using a survey of households in Peru with detailed credit information (they
exploited the same Peruvian land titling program as Field). They found very small
effects of titles on the credit market, with property titles associated with approval
rates 12 % higher when titles were requested in public banks for construction
material loans, and no relationship between titles and approval decisions otherwise.
However, the authors could not rule out that this small effect was due to other
unobservable characteristics affecting the creditworthiness of titled and untitled
applicants.
Once again, exploiting the same quasi-experimental setting in Peru, Field (2007)
examined the effect of land titles on the labor market. She found that households
with no legal claim to property spent an average of 13.4 h per week maintaining
informal tenure security, reﬂecting a 14 % reduction in household labor supply.
Household members were also 40 % more likely to work inside of their homes.
Field claims that the positive effect on employment was due to the reduced need to
stay at home to informally secure it (home security demands), a need faced by the
untitled. Galiani and Schargrodsky (2011) claim that the labor market context is
important in interpreting the effect of titles on employment, since in the setting
studied in Argentina the unemployment rate was very high, which could be the
reason why they did not ﬁnd an effect of titling on employment. Field (2003) also
interprets her ﬁnding of a smaller household size for the titled as demanding less
security. Another interpretation of smaller household size for the titled is that when
there are no formal property rights, it is easier to keep informal property rights in
case of divorce or death when the extended family lives in the dwelling. Also,
households with secure rights can use the house as insurance for the future, whereas
housing investments, negative effects on household size, and positive effects on
child education. Effects on the labor market are not conclusive. There is weak
support for the hypothesis that land titling can have positive effects on capital
investment because the dwelling can be used as collateral. The reason could be due
to the very limited access of slum dwellers to the credit market. Another reason
could be that the high legal costs of eviction and executing a mortgage might
preclude mortgaged credit (Galiani and Schargrodsky 2011).
There are different types of land titling, and we still do not know which one is
optimal for each case. More studies are needed to study the effect of different types
of land titles and the degree of titling. UN-Habitat (2007), for example, advocates
various interim occupancy rights such as granting nontransferable short-term leases,
collective property rights, use of community land trusts, and protection against
eviction. Galiani and Schargrodsky (2011) point out that the main decision should
˜
be in terms of individual recording or registration. Arrunada and Garoupa (2005)
studied the relative efﬁciency of these two systems and found evidence that, at least
in developed countries, registration is more efﬁcient (with efﬁciency increasing with
the frequency of land transactions).
4.1.3 Promoting home ownership for the poor
There has been a battery of supply-side policies to make housing affordable for lowincome households in LAC. Unlike the case of land titling, however, there are scant
evaluations on the effect of supply-side policies. The basic policy is to give the poor a
new house at a subsidized price either where they live in substandard conditions or
relocate them. This policy can be seen as an attempt to solve the housing problem
through direct intervention in the form of a capital housing subsidy (UN-Habitat 2003).
These initiatives usually take the form of relocation programs in which
households are allocated completely new, prebuilt dwellings at a small cost or for
free. As such, these programs simultaneously incorporate a number of the elements
of slum upgrading. In the 1970s it was the State in charge of building the housing,
but in 1977 Chile pioneered an innovative program to give incentives to the private
sector to build those houses and at the same time promote demand by providing
subsidies to low-income households to buy them. The subsidy was allocated to
families that were both poor and prepared to help themselves. The test of the latter
was their willingness to accumulate savings; the longer their savings record and the
greater their savings, the more likely they were to get a subsidy. Major elements of
the Chilean housing subsidy model spread to other LAC countries, notably
´
˜
Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, and Panama (Held 2000; Perez-Inigo 1999). In
1994, South Africa adopted a similar kind of policy (the Reconstruction and
Development Programme) that provided nearly 2 million houses.
In Chile there was a massive investment in subsidized housing through which
more than a million Chileans moved out of slum neighborhoods and become
property owners (Salcedo 2011). Marcano and Ruprah (2008) performed an
evaluation of the Chilean Progressive Housing Program, a public housing initiative
mortgage) was inappropriate to target the poor. In addition, they found that although
the program had signiﬁcant positive effects on housing conditions (access to water,
sewerage, and electricity), it had a negative effect on overcrowding, and had no
discernible effects on welfare indicators (poverty, school attendance, occupation
ratio, etc.). This could be due to high residential segregation, as the public housing
was in remote locations very far from job opportunities. Following the analytical
framework in Sect. 3, the poor would not move further out because they usually
cannot afford the transport cost to go to work. Salcedo (2011) pointed to positive
effects from this policy in terms of living conditions, but also noted concerns about
stigmatization and social cohesion.
Another example of a relocation experience can be found in Cattaneo et al.
(2006), who analyzed the performance of the Mexican We Start Your Home
(Iniciamos Tu Casa) Program. This program involved providing new houses to poor
inhabitants, but the houses were located far from the city center. A year after the
program started, a large proportion of the participants had abandoned the houses;
moreover, those who remained said that, although housing conditions were better,
the new neighborhoods had poor access to public goods and general infrastructure.
Promoting home ownership is very expensive if the State has to subsidize the
total value of the dwelling. An option usually available for medium- and highincome segments is a mortgage, which in the case of the poor can be partly
subsidized. The problem is that the penetration of ﬁnancial services among lowincome groups remains very limited: the mortgage-debt-to-GDP ratio is 3 % in
Brazil, 5 % in India, and 10 % in Mexico. In contrast, the ratio is 72 % in the
United States (Magowan 2008). Among low-income groups it is more common to
ﬁnance housing through informal channels, such as cash from relatives and friends
or resources from cooperatives.
Some countries have implemented government-supported liquidity facilities,
such as the Cagamas program in Malaysia, Sociedad Hipotecaria Federal in Mexico,
and the Mortgage Reﬁnance Company in Egypt (Hoek-Smit 2009). There are no
rigorous evaluations of these programs, but the qualitative evidence available shows
that these solutions might help solve housing problems, though they do not seem to
work for the very poor either.15
We conclude that promoting house ownership should be in situ or close to the
central business district. Incentives to the private sector to build cheap houses in
scale would help increase the supply of housing for low-income families. The
location of the new houses is key for the success of the program. Still, access to the
ﬁnancial market is very limited for the poor, so liquidity facilities are of little help
for this population segment.
4.1.4 Promoting the rental market
Historically, governments in LAC have focused on home ownership. The reason for
this can be based on a perception that home ownership brings about greater
15

ultimately better labor outcomes. However, there is no conclusive empirical
evidence of this. As detailed in Sect. 2, the rate of home ownership is very high on
average in LAC in comparison with other regions (UN-Habitat 2003). The rental
sector in most LAC countries is small—typically less than one-ﬁfth of all
households rent (IDB 2012).
To promote the rental market, there should ﬁrst be units available for rent for
poorer population segments. In the developed world there have been programs that
built public housing to rent to low-income families. Those dwellings are usually
managed by local authorities and the rents are capped to a certain percentage of the
income of the household. In the United States this has been a popular and by all
accounts successful policy (Sinai and Waldfogel 2005). However, some authors
point to the deterioration of this type of accommodation over time, as the dwellings
are sometimes poorly managed and located in disadvantaged neighborhoods
(O’Sullivan 2009).
Another supply-side policy used in the United States has been preferential tax
treatment for the construction of low-cost rental units. A very popular US program
has been the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC), which was introduced in
1986 and has since expanded. The LIHTC is an indirect federal subsidy that gives
tax incentives for investors in affordable housing by reducing upfront costs. The
program has created 75,000 new apartments annually in recent years and is
considered one of the most successful rental supply programs (NAHB 2011).
European countries have used other programs to encourage private investment in
affordable housing, such as preferred interest rates or direct grants.
On the demand side, OECD countries have used two strategies: rent supplements
and housing allowances (Andrews et al. 2011). Rent supplements top up the
remaining cost of the rent after exceeding 30 % of the household income (Bouillon
2012). Housing allowances are vouchers that can be used in any place and do not
require any direct contract with a landlord. It is possible to have minimal condition
or size standards to ensure the program is not supporting poor quality housing. The
subsidy payment similarly uses a percentage of income, such as 30 %, but adds
another element, which is a ‘‘percentage of gap’’ between the 30 % level and actual
market rent. Usually both strategies coexist.
An interesting rental voucher program was Moving to Opportunity (MTO),
launched in 1994 by the US Department of Housing and Urban Development. Its
goal was to make housing in better neighborhoods affordable to low-income
households. Even though its focus was not on access to housing, it is worth
reviewing this program given its design and results. The idea was to improve the
employment, education, and health of low-income families living in poor
neighborhoods with poverty rates of 40 % or more by providing them with
residential mobility. Over 3 years, roughly 4200 families from ﬁve major cities—
Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York—were recruited to
participate. MTO allocated vouchers to occupy houses in better locations (with less
than 10 % of poverty incidence). The winners of vouchers (treatment group) were
vouchers experienced improvements in multiple measures of well-being relative to
the control group, including safety, health, and behavioral problems among boys.
There were no signiﬁcant short-run effects of vouchers on the employment,
earnings, or welfare receipt of household heads. Katz et al. (2005) found mixed
effects on crime while Katz et al. (2007) found that 4–7 years after the lottery,
families offered vouchers lived in safer neighborhoods than families not offered
vouchers. The program also improved the mental health of adults and young women
but no change in economic self-sufﬁciency was identiﬁed.
Galiani et al. (2012) analyzed the MTO program by combining the experimental
data with a structural model to estimate a location choice model. The authors used
the random variation in the rents of households to estimate the model. They
performed interesting policy exercises to investigate whether more stringent
location restrictions are successful in changing exposure to certain neighborhood
characteristics, such as a low poverty rate in the neighborhood of residence. In the
case of the MTO program, the poverty rate for the receiving neighborhoods was less
than 10 % and take-up was around 50 %. Galiani et al. (2012) estimate that only
13 % of households would use the subsidy under a more stringent restriction that
limits subsidy use to neighborhoods with a poverty rate under 5 %. An important
implication of this is that more stringent location constraints designed with the goal
of exposing the target population to lower neighborhood poverty rates could end up
reducing the take-up of the program and the average poverty rate to which the
treated group is exposed to (due to less take-up).
The aim of the MTO program was to expose households in poor neighborhoods
to a better environment, rather than improve the housing infrastructure. In practice,
a program like this is very unlikely to be carried out in LAC. Mixing the population
from ‘‘good’’ and ‘‘bad’’ neighborhoods would indeed decrease the segregation
measures and negative neighborhood effects. However, for relocation interventions
to be sustainable, slum dwellers would need to have incentives to stay in the new
location (such as economic opportunities and better urban services). In the
developing world there have been no experiences of moving households to lowpoverty neighborhoods (like the MTO program), but as described before, in some
circumstances efforts were made to move entire slum populations to a safer area.
Such experiences have proven costly in social and ﬁnancial terms.
4.2 Transport systems
Transportation is a pillar of economic development and affects the productivity and
spatial patterns of cities in many dimensions. First, following the analytical
framework of Sect. 3, transport costs together with the price of housing services
determine the location of households in cities. As stated earlier, there is a trade-off
between the price of housing services and transport costs.
Second, the process of rapid urbanization has resulted in an increase in
transportation demands (Gilles and Turner 2012). Problems with road congestion
and pollution have come up, and these problems are more severe in LAC than in
opportunity cost of time). However, when one person more commutes by car, there
is a negative congestion externality, as trafﬁc is slowed down. Thus, in the model,
the private cost of commuting is lower than the social cost. (See Brueckner et al.
2011 for an extension of the model to the theoretical include congestion.)
We detail different ways of correcting the market failure brought about by
congestion. Regarding the ﬁrst impact of transport systems, we review alternatives
to eliminate the urban divide and improve the links from poor suburbs to city
centers, as well as policies that improve transport infrastructure.
4.2.1 Sustainable urban transport
First let us consider all the transportation options available in cities. There are four
types of urban modes of transport: (1) motorized private transport, typically cars; (2)
nonmotorized transport, including nonemission modes of transport such as bicycles,
rickshaws, and walking; (3) formal public transport, which encompasses services
available to the public that run on pre-set routes and timetables with set fares, and
that include buses, tramways, metros, suburban rail, and waterborne transport
(ferries, boats); and (4) informal (motorized) transport, including privately owned
vehicles whose operators often lack necessary permits or do not meet requirements
for vehicle size, insurance coverage, or driver standards.
The current level of motorized private transport use is not sustainable because it
generates pollution and congestion and hinders human and economic development
in cities. In particular, in LAC vehicle ownership has increased hugely as a
consequence of economic growth and social progress. The average number of motor
vehicles per capita in 1990 was 0.09; by 2008, it had risen to 0.20, which increased
trafﬁc and slowed down commuting speeds (Freeman et al. 2013).
The approach to transport has traditionally been focused on mobility. To attain a
sustainable transport system there should be a paradigm shift to favor access rather
than mobility, focus on efﬁcient and ﬂuent modes of transport, and promote lowcarbon and clean vehicles and fuels (Hidalgo and Huizenga 2013). This paradigm
involves three types of actions: avoiding long and unnecessary motorized travel,
shifting the movement of goods and people to the most efﬁcient modes of transport,
and improving the technology and operational management of transport services
(Dalkmann and Brannigan 2007).
Following the framework in Sect. 3 we can see that intervention in the transport
system is needed to internalize the social cost of congestion in the private cost of
transport considered in the model. Some governments have either implemented
travel demand management policies or have considered ways of directly reducing
the number of vehicles in congested areas.
To date, travel demand management measures in LAC have been mainly
vehicular restrictions and the promotion of public transport modes. The types of
administrative restrictions applied have consisted mostly of monitoring license plate
numbers. These experiences have proven unsustainable in the medium and long
term or have had negative effects (Ide Carvallo and Lizana 2011). Examples of such
and increased the hours worked by the huge taxi ﬂeet to replace car trips (Davis
2007); the No Car Day (Dia sin Carro) in Bogota, which has resulted in a signiﬁcant
´
social loss for car users (Cantillo and Ortuzar 2011) and has not reduced pollution
given the poor quality of public transport (Ide Carvallo and Lizana 2011); the
Vehicle Restriction (Restriccion Vehicular) Program in Santiago, which reduced
trafﬁc by one-ﬁfth of the expected effect (De Grange and Troncoso 2010); and the
˜
Estadual Rodizio Program in Sao Paulo, which increased the car ﬂeet (Biezus and
Oliveira Rocha 1999). The Vehicle Restriction (Restriccion Vehicular) Program in
San Jose, Costa Rica and the Peak and Plate (Pico y Placa) Program in Medellin are
similar examples that have not been successful (Ide Carvallo and Lizana 2011). Pico
y Pala in Quito has had mixed results.16
On the other hand, examples of travel demand management policies in developed
cities can be found, for example, in Singapore (vehicle registration caps and
dynamic congestion pricing), London (congestion pricing), Milan (air pollution
pricing), and San Francisco (parking controls with dynamic pricing). While in LAC
travel demand management policies have mainly involved road rationing through
‘‘command-and-control,’’ in the developed world incentive-based policies are more
common.
Congestion pricing is a very popular travel demand management measure that
encompasses a set of strategies and techniques aimed at imposing charges that
effectively discourage motorists from entering a congested area during certain
periods of high trafﬁc congestion (Hau 1992; Vickrey 1969). The concept behind
congestion pricing is to charge those using private cars with the negative externality
they produce by slowing down the trafﬁc and producing more pollution. It is
assumed that people would make socially efﬁcient decisions if they fully consider
the social costs and beneﬁts. The optimal congestion tax is the marginal external
cost at the point where the marginal social cost is equal to the marginal social
beneﬁt (Button 1993). In practice, an analysis of pricing schemes ensures that
congestion taxes are appropriately set.
Multiple forms of congestion pricing have been implemented, including schemes
covering the inner city (as in London), a signiﬁcant part of the metropolitan area (as
in Singapore), or a wider perimeter area (as in Oslo). These strategies have been
effective in reducing congestion and pollution. For example, the congestion charge
in London reduced the number of private cars, vans, and trucks coming into central
London between 2002 (year of introduction) and 2003 by 27 %. There was a drop
by 33 % in inbound car trafﬁc (65,000–70,000 trips that are no longer made),17 a
decrease in trafﬁc congestion, and an increase in the mean speed in the inner city
(Leape 2006). It is important to highlight that in London there are very fast and
accessible alternatives to private cars, such as the metro (tube) or a wide coverage of
buses.

In 2003, London imposed a daily charge for driving or parking a vehicle on public roads within central
London. Today the congestion charge is £10 daily between 7:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. on weekdays to enter
successful in reducing congestion and pollution, there are barriers that currently
prevent it from being widely adopted in LAC. These include implementation of a
sophisticated tracking system to enforce it and the development of efﬁcient
alternatives to private motorized transport (Rogat et al. 2009).
In the past decade, the development of sustainable transportation programs based
on public transport has become popular in LAC. There are no rigorous studies, but
the descriptive evidence shows that such programs have had positive results in
reducing pollution and trafﬁc in some Latin American cities, such as Bogota,
Mexico City, and Santiago. Among these programs, the two main types are
initiatives for mass transit using rapid transit bus systems and the use of bikes. For
example, Brazil and Colombia implemented major transport policies based on
cycling promotion that integrated cycling lanes into the public transport network
(Bicycle Brazil, and Ciclorutas in Colombia), and rapid bus transport. Chile has
focused on improvements of public transport with rapid bus transport within the
Transantiago Plan.
Countries included in the Sustainable Transport Forum (Foro de Transporte
Sostenible—FTS) survey carried out by the United Nations Centre for Regional
Development and the Inter-American Development Bank reported 42 cities with
mass transit (rail and rapid bus transport) and 327 cities with bike lanes (85 % in
Brazil) (UNCRD-IDB 2011). In terms of total kilometers, the largest mass transit
availability is in Brazil, with 829 km of suburban railway, 278 km of metro, and
80 km of rapid bus transport in 16 cities. Argentina has the largest suburban rail
network (830 km). The largest extension of rapid bus transport corridors is in
Colombia (386 km in six cities). Availability of mass transit ranges between 2.2 and
41.6 km per million urban inhabitants (Peru and Chile, respectively) to no mass
transit. Availability of bike lanes ranges from 2 to 15 km per million urban
inhabitants (Mexico and Brazil, respectively). While the length of metro and
suburban rail systems has not grown substantially in the past decade in LAC, both
rapid bus transport and bike lanes have grown explosively.
Bocarejo and Oviedo (2013) analyze the rapid bus transport network,
Transmilenio, in Bogota. While urban sprawl has been the general growth pattern
in most developing cities worldwide, Bogota has undergone a process of
densiﬁcation in speciﬁc areas in the past decade. Using a differences-in-differences
methodology, Bocarejo and Oviedo (2013) show that the Transmilenio, built during
that period, is one of the variables that account for this higher density. Areas served
by Transmilenio, especially those in the periphery that have been provided with
feeder bus routes, have higher growth than zones without access to this system.
There are descriptive studies on other rapid bus transport systems in LAC that
have had mixed results. The evaluation of Metrobus in Mexico City by Global Mass
Transit Research (2009) showed that the operation of Lines 1 and 2 of the Metrobus
has produced an important decrease in pollution (less emissions). In addition, both
lines have brought commuter time savings of 30 %. On the other hand, reports on
Metrobus-Q in Quito and Transmilenio in Santiago show mixed results (Ide
Geographical segregation is a major problem affecting the income opportunities of
slum dwellers. Slums are usually ‘‘bad’’ neighborhoods with deﬁcient services
(urban infrastructure, health, education, etc.), social and economic violence, and
limited working opportunities. Usually the jobs available are unstable, informal, and
have low productivity. Wealthier neighborhoods of the city, on the other hand, have
more economic opportunities but are hard to reach for some low-income
households. Sometimes the transport links are deﬁcient or nonexistent; other times
the slums are located in areas far from the city center. The social stigma of slum
dwellers because they live in deﬁcient housing is also a factor reducing their
possibilities in the city. Geographical segregation is just one aspect of social (and, in
some countries, racial) segregation endured by slum dwellers. For example, Perlman
(2003) provides evidence from slums in Rio de Janeiro suggesting that the stigma of
having a residential address in a squatter settlement has adverse consequences on
the probability of getting a job.
Public transit has a key role in socially and physically integrating the urban poor
into the formal city. Mobility is one of the main factors that reduce social exclusion
(Vella-Brodrick et al. 2011). In recent years large infrastructure projects have been
undertaken in LAC cities to reduce the immense divide between prosperous areas
and slums. An example is the inauguration in December 2011 of the giant outdoor
escalator to Medellin’s slum, Comuna 13. The 1260-foot escalator, built at a cost of
US$6.7 million, has shortened the 35-min hike on foot up the hillside to get to
Comuna 13 to a 6-min ride. The Metrocable in Medellin and the Transmilenio in
Bogota are aimed at similar purposes. In Rio de Janeiro, a six-station cable car line
inaugurated in 2011 runs above a collection of favelas known as the Complexo do
Alemao and carries an estimated 30,000 people a day along a 2.1-mile route. This
US$74 million urban gondola line has transformed what used to be an hour-and-ahalf journey into a 16-min sky ride. The extent to which geographical segregation
was alleviated by these innovations, and their effect on housing and other
socioeconomic outcomes has yet to be studied.
Apart from these large infrastructure projects, other reforms in public transit can
shape the spatial patterns of a city and the housing choices of the urban poor. First,
the trend to demotorize large cities can help the poor if it increases cycling and
walking space in city centers and promotes affordable public means of transport
(such as rapid bus transport). To integrate the poor via transport, a very careful
diagnostic study should ﬁrst be performed to assess whether the current transport
network is in fact inaccessible (does not reach poor areas) or unaffordable.
As shown in Sect. 2, public transport in LAC is relatively more expensive than in
the developed world in terms of its proportion of the minimum wage. In many
African cities, commuting by public transit costs between 26 and 50 % of the poor
household’s income (Cervero 2011). In the United States, Roberto (2008), using
data from 2000, found that the 10 % poorest spent twice as much share of their
income on commuting to work than the 10 % richest (6.1 versus 3.8 %).
The relevant question is which share of income is reasonable to be spent in
annual income should be spent on transport. Transport fares worldwide are
subsidized, but for the poor the burden is still too high. Targeted subsidies seem to
be an appropriate policy to reach the right groups and increase access to jobs. For
example, South Africa uses highly subsidized weekly coupons—each for 10
journeys between black townships and industrial development areas—to connect
low-income groups to jobs. Brazil requires formal sector employers to provide
transit tickets to employees through a system called Vale Transporte (VT). Firms
then deduct the VT expenditures from taxable income. The VT system effectively
spreads the cost of transport subsidies between employers and the government,
though it only affects those employed in the formal sector.
Mass transport (rapid bus transport, rails, subways, trams), when adequately
planned and implemented, has the potential to alleviate congestion and pollution,
and can particularly beneﬁt the poor, who rely most on these means of transport to
commute to work. Accessible and affordable transport can have a wide range of
positive effects. For example, Stanley et al. (2011) show that mobility improves
well-being. The effects of such transport on the consumption of housing services
and access to the labor market are of particular interest, but those effects have not
been widely studied. The effect of public transport expansion on employment has
been studied in the United States, with evidence showing that improving access to
jobs reduces the probability of asking for public assistance and increases the
likelihood of getting a paid job for unemployed adults and welfare recipients
(Sandoval et al. 2010). Kawabata (2003) shows a positive effect of access to
transport on being employed among low-skilled workers in San Francisco. In sum,
mass public transit is key to shaping the spatial sorting of citizens, and has the
potential to improve housing and labor market outcomes. Therefore it should
certainly be promoted in LAC.
4.2.3 Transport infrastructure
The improvement of transport infrastructure, such as repairs of roads and highways,
is a common supply-side policy to upgrade the transport system. In an urban
context, street paving has multiple functions: it facilitates vehicle, pedestrian, and
cyclist movement and access, provides accessible space for vehicle parking, allows
commercial vehicles to deliver goods, and has a signiﬁcant impact on the visual
appearance of the area. However, it can also lead to congestion.
Gonzalez-Navarro and Quintana-Domeque (2010) studied a randomized ﬁeld
experiment in Acayucan, Mexico, in which the city expanded its pavement grid over
time via street asphalting projects. Given that the municipal administration could
afford to pay for only 28 of the 56 projects in 2006, it was agreed to select the 28
streets to be paved at random. The follow-up was conducted almost a year after the
intervention and focused on households that were present both before and after the
intervention. They found that street paving led to a doubling in the average number
of home improvements in which a household engaged over the previous 6 months
(from 0.4 to 0.8 improvements). Furthermore, there was a 50 % increase in the
vehicles acquired. The rise in motor vehicle acquisition can also be explained by
complementarities with street paving. However, street paving has no statistically
signiﬁcant effect on monthly per capita expenditure (nondurable consumption).
Street paving increased home prices, though these estimates do not adjust for the
improvements in the house driven by the intervention itself. Street paving also
increased the percentage of individuals who used collateral-based credit from about
2 % among the control group to nearly 5 % among the treated group.
4.3 Housing infrastructure
In light of the growth perspectives of LAC cities, promoting access to the formal
housing market and improving mass public transit for the poor could eventually
prevent the formation of new slums and perhaps help reduce the size of existing
ones. However, some slums may persist if the poor prefer locations that are closer to
the city center.18 Also, slums may continue to grow because poverty traps impede
migrants from moving to a better location, despite the intention of the poor when
they move to the city to live in a slum only temporarily (Marx et al. 2013).
Following the framework of Sect. 3, families moving to the city that choose to
live close to the central business district will have a level of housing services below
qs. An important part of the compound variable q is housing infrastructure. The
urban poor live in housing with inadequate services, which poses a risk to their
health, security, and socioeconomic development. Low living standards pose
hazards to development.
To start with, adequate housing protects households from the negative effects of
the environment: proper roofs and walls shelter household members from rain and
cold (Galiani et al. 2013). Safe water and sanitation facilities, as well as nondirt
ﬂoors, are important to protect dwellers against parasitic infestations and infections.
Deﬁcient facilities contribute to acute respiratory diseases and diarrhea, among
other infectious waterborne diseases (e.g., tuberculosis, hepatitis, dengue, pneumonia, cholera, and malaria) (Luby et al. 2004). In addition to these health issues,
overcrowding increases the possibility that contagious diseases will spread within
the household when one member falls ill.
Children are the most affected by inadequate housing facilities. Galiani et al.
(2005), for example, show that safe water reduces child mortality. The damage from
childhood diseases and malnutrition can be irreversible. Children often miss school
due to illness, and anemia can make them permanently lag behind in their cognitive
development (Cattaneo et al. 2009). Adequate housing also provides security
against crime, a major problem in slum areas. Proper housing can enable families to
accumulate assets and free up their time from protecting assets in order to engage in
more productive activities (Field 2007).
For all these reasons, adequate housing is critical for health, child development,
and household productivity, which in turn contribute to a better quality of life.
Moreover, proper housing can induce a sense of dignity. Thus, housing quality has a
18

of happiness with all aspects of life. It is natural that the houses and neighborhoods
where people live are major factors inﬂuencing their life satisfaction. Surveys and
studies reveal that in LAC, people’s satisfaction with the homes and cities where
they live is a main determinant of their overall life satisfaction (Lora et al. 2010).
Several approaches have been tried to address the problem of slums. The ﬁrst has
been the ‘‘eradication’’ strategy, which has proven expensive (assuming governments can provide homes for the displaced population) and socially disruptive.
Then, in the 1970s a popular approach was ‘‘site-and-services,’’ which provided
urbanized lots for families to build their homes progressively away from slum areas.
This approach has also been criticized for being incomplete and leaving families
worse off as they lost their social capital, than they were when they lived in the
original slum area. Since the 1980s, local and central governments have increasingly
undertaken in situ slum upgrading based on the notion that it is both socially and
economically more desirable. In situ upgrading and improvement programs have the
goal of integrating low-income communities into the formal city and the housing
market. The main advantage of in situ slum upgrading is that it maintains the social
networks of the dwellers and the cohesiveness of the community because residents
remain in the same location, but under better living conditions (Abdenur 2009). This
approach has led to the implementation of a variety of programs, from those that
deal with land tenure to fully integrated programs.19 The next section analyzes
different types of programs to improve the housing services of the urban poor.
4.3.1 In situ housing infrastructure upgrading
To improve the living standards of the poor, there is consensus that upgrading
infrastructure for water, sanitation, and hygiene should be the priority because of the
health issues involved, especially for children. Diarrhea is closely related to poor
living conditions and is estimated to be the cause of 21 % of deaths of children
under 5 years of age in developing countries, accounting for 2.5 million deaths per
year (Kosek et al. 2003). Unsafe water supply and the lack of proper sanitation
facilities, together with poor hygiene practices, cause approximately 88 % of all
diarrhea infections worldwide (Evans 2005). This problem is more severe in slums,
as they are densely populated environments in which where infections propagate
easily.
Galiani et al. (2005) found that improving the quality of water through the
privatization of water supply decreased child mortality in Argentina. Also, the
promotion of safe hygiene practices and improved sanitation are effective in
improving child health (Luby et al. 2004; Hutton and Haller 2004). Luby et al.
(2006) found positive results for reducing diarrhea from the effects of combining
drinking water treatment and hand washing for prevention.
Access to infrastructure is usually a principal component of comprehensive slum
upgrading programs. Making infrastructure work for the poor requires promoting
access and ensuring that consumption is affordable. Better access can involve
19

requiring operators to promote access. Affordability can involve reducing actual
bills and service costs and facilitating easier payments. There is evidence of low
demand for some services due to a lack of information regarding the positive effects
of better facilities, or because the use of those services involves changes in habits
(Banerjee and Duﬂo 2011). In addition, the lack of formal land tenure is often cited
as a cause for not investing in housing upgrades, as untenured households fear
eviction (Galiani and Schargrodsky 2010). There is also a growing literature on the
willingness to pay for such services in Asia and Africa. Ashraf et al. (2010) and
Kremer et al. (2009) conducted randomized experiments in Zambia and Kenya,
respectively, and found low willingness—in terms of money spent on chlorine or
time spent on collecting water—to pay for improved water quality.
More studies are needed to increase access to better services and promote the
uptake of new technologies that can have positive direct effects on health. The
problem is complex because the provision of these services also involves collective
action problems, as there are usually positive or negative externalities of individual
take-up in the community that inﬂuence willingness to pay and other factors. For
example, to implement a program that extends sewage or water connections, a
minimum amount of households need to be willing to adopt the service. Duﬂo et al.
(2012) describe the barriers to adoption of water, sanitation, and hygiene
interventions, especially in Africa and Asia.
There are a set of papers that study the impact of housing improvements on a
wide range of outcomes and that exploit experimental or quasi-experimental. They
include Galiani et al. (2013) on the effect of prefabricated housing interventions,
Cattaneo et al. (2009) on the effect of replacing dirt ﬂoors with cement ﬂoors, and
Devoto et al. (2012) on the effects of piped water connection.
Galiani et al. (2013) assess the impact of providing better houses in situ to slum
dwellers in El Salvador, Mexico, and Uruguay. The authors experimentally
evaluated the impact of an initiative called A Roof for My Country (Un Techo Para
Mi Paıs—UTPMP), a youth-led program that provides basic prefabricated houses to
´
extremely poor populations in LAC. UTPMP budget and personnel constraints limit
the number of housing units that can be upgraded at any one time, so beneﬁciaries
are selected through a lottery system. Galiani et al. (2013) rely on a randomized
controlled experiment to evaluate the effect of upgrading houses in slums, thus
reporting internally valid. In addition, as the same experiment was replicated in
three different countries with very similar results, it can give us a hint of the external
validity of its estimates.
UTPMP houses are made of wood (Mexico and Uruguay) or aluminum (El
Salvador).20 A typical house is 18 meters squared and is built by teams of youth
volunteers working alongside the beneﬁciary household. UTPMP dwellings offer
signiﬁcant improvements for the poor population targeted in terms of ﬂooring, roof,
and walls, but it should be borne in mind that the homes do not come with water and

20

The UTPMP works in 18 Latin American countries. The evaluation performed by Galiani et al. (2013)
drinking water, or gas.
As expected, the program substantially improves the quality of ﬂoors, walls, and
roofs, as well as the share of rooms in the house with windows. Living in a better
house can on itself be a source of satisfaction, dignity, and pride, aside from other
dimensions such as health, education, or labor outcomes. Galiani et al. (2013) found
that families reported being signiﬁcantly happier with their houses and their lives.
The gains were substantially larger in El Salvador, where houses were in worse
conditions before the treatment, than in Uruguay and Mexico. However, the study
also found that families did not further improve their houses as a response to the
improvements made under the program. In particular, there were no signiﬁcant
effects on access to water, electricity, sanitation, or the possession of assets.
The estimates show that in El Salvador all self-reported measures of security
increased substantially—the increase in the index for security inside the house was
around 30 % and that for whether it is safe to leave children alone was about 90 %.
On the other hand, no effect was detected in Uruguay or Mexico. The authors did
not ﬁnd an effect of the program on victimization rates in any country.
Galiani et al. (2013) examined whether a better house could directly or indirectly
stimulate labor supply and earnings and did not detect signiﬁcant effects on any
labor market outcomes. They did ﬁnd positive effects on child health measured by
reduced diarrhea prevalence in El Salvador and Mexico. This could be due to having
a cleaner and better ventilated dwelling provided by the program.
In summary, it seems that better houses in situ for slum dwellers in El Salvador,
Mexico, and Uruguay improve satisfaction with the quality of life. Perceptions of
security changed for the better in El Salvador, and there seems to have been a
positive effect on child health in El Salvador and Mexico. However, the program
had no signiﬁcant effect either on the possession of assets or on labor outcomes.
Cattaneo et al. (2009) investigated the impact of a large-scale program, called
Solid Ground (Piso Firme), undertaken by the Mexican government to replace dirt
ﬂoors up to 50 m2 with cement ﬂoors. Dirt ﬂoors are a threat to health because they
provide a vector for parasites to infest people, especially young children, since fecal
matter tends to remain on the ﬂoor (difﬁcult to spot and clean). To identify the
effects of this intervention the authors took advantage of the geographic variability
in implementation of the program that started in 2000 some states were treated but
neighboring states were not. The treatment areas were high-density, low-income
urban neighborhoods, and eligible households had to have dirt ﬂoors and be able
prove home ownership prior to participating in the program. The households already
had water and sanitation facilities. The program covered the cost of the cement,
while households supplied the labor input needed to prepare and install the ﬂoor.
The study found that replacing dirt ﬂoors with cement ﬂoors interrupts the
transmission of parasitic infestations and reduces the incidence of both diarrhea and
anemia. Reduction in anemia is expected to have positive effects on cognitive
development. In fact, the study found that children in treated households performed
signiﬁcantly better on child development tests. However, an alternative pathway
could have been through the program’s effect on economic resources. Piso Firme
and invest in cement ﬂoors, it could have used the resources freed up by this in-kind
transfer to increase consumption or to make other kinds of investments, such as
additional housing investments that could affect health outcomes or in microenterprises that might increase household income. The authors rule out this channel, as
they show that the program is not associated with the value of houses (treatment
households did not consider their houses to be more valuable than control
households did), with changes in income, or with total consumption. Also, the
program did not have the effect of encouraging households to make additional
improvements to their houses.
A main result of the Piso Firme intervention, as described in Cattaneo et al.
(2009), is that following implementation of the program adults were substantially
happier, as measured by their degree of satisfaction with their housing and quality of
life, and had signiﬁcantly lower scores on depression and perceived stress. The
reasons adults were happier may have to do with the fact that they were living in a
better environment and their children were healthier. These results indicate that
housing has a signiﬁcant effect on welfare.
Devoto et al. (2012) studied the welfare effects of a program that increases access
to piped water in low-income households in Tangiers, Morocco. Many poor urban
households in Tangiers were located in neighborhoods connectable to the water
system, but could not afford the connection fee. These households had free access to
public taps installed in their neighborhood, and also had sanitation facilities at
home. The program provided a subsidized interest-free loan to install a water
connection. The loan was to be repaid in regular installments with the water bill
over 3 to 7 years. The loan did not cover the cost of installing the connection or the
cost of water consumed. To pilot-test the program, a door-to-door awareness
campaign was conducted in early 2008 among 434 households, randomly chosen
from the 845 that needed a connection.
The authors found with this randomized experiment that households are willing
to pay a substantial amount of money to gain access to a private tap at home. Within
a year, 69 % of households in the treatment group had purchased a connection
(against 10 % in the control group), and as a result their average monthly water bill
more than doubled from US$9 to US$24 a month (the previous cost came from
households that used water from their neighbors). The quality of water was
unchanged, since public taps are also maintained and the water comes from the
same source. The study found no change in the incidence of water-borne diseases,
such as child diarrhea. The connection generated important time gains, but it did not
lead to increases in labor market participation, income, or schooling attainment. The
extra time seems to have been used for leisure and socializing. The private
connection program did reduce the risk of conﬂict or ill-feelings between neighbors.
Overall, consistent with Cattaneo et al. (2009), Devoto et al. (2012) noted that that
households’ psychological well-being improves substantially when they upgrade
their housing facilities.
It is important to note that the intervention studied by Devoto et al. (2012)
provided a loan rather than an in-kind subsidy. Their conclusions are useful in terms
offered the loan. Thus, initiatives like that in Morocco, for which there is
willingness to pay, can involve relatively low costs for the state yet improve the
welfare of poor urban families through investments in better housing.
In summary, the ﬁndings of these papers, which have an internally valid design,
suggest that limited in situ improvements in housing are not sufﬁcient to bring about
signiﬁcant changes in living conditions of the urban poor. Providing better housing
and housing facilities improves slum dwellers’ well-being and satisfaction with life,
but does not reduce the various ailments they suffer as a result of living in slums.
What might be necessary, then, is to carry out broader slum upgrading programs that
combine housing improvements with broader interventions that address other major
problems affecting slum dwellers.
4.3.2 Integral urban upgrading
Among the several forms of urban development interventions, slum upgrading
offers an incomparable opportunity to affect many neighborhood outcomes that can
reshape the environment of a human settlement. Integral upgrading programs have
the ability to mobilize many different actors in diverse policy areas at various levels.
These programs can give momentum to the idea that improving a neighborhood
involves all dimensions of its life, including the freedom of citizens from or risk of
injury, public safety, welfare, satisfaction with life, education, employment, and
access to services, among others.
There is scant rigorous evidence on the effectiveness of such programs. There is
only one randomized evaluation by McIntosh et al. (2013), who studied a major
federal infrastructure spending program in poor neighborhoods in Mexico from
2009 to 2011. The intervention analyzed is a phase of the Habitat program of the
´
Social Development Secretariat (SEDESOL). The program, which has made US$68
million in infrastructure investments, targets the urban poor and focuses on
neighborhood upgrading through urban infrastructure (roads, water, sewerage,
lighting, and sidewalks) as well as community centers, parks, sports facilities, and
skill upgrading such as job training for the unemployed and health and nutrition
training for young mothers.
SEDESOL’s Habitat Program randomly selects a ‘‘polygon’’ (a speciﬁc
´
neighborhood) within each participating municipality for the upgrading program.
In order to be eligible for the program, a polygon needs to have a state and
municipal government willing to cooperate with the program’s cost-sharing rules,
which require local government to provide 50 % of project costs. In the projects
studied, the municipalities provided 40 % of those costs, the states provided 8 %,
and the beneﬁciaries provided 2 %. Also, according to the study, to be eligible the
populations in those polygons needed to be settled in marginalized urban areas with
concentrations of asset poverty greater than 50 %, located in cities of 15,000
inhabitants or more, with a deﬁcit of infrastructure and urban services, and with at
least 80 % of the lots having no active conﬂict over property rights.
McIntosh et al. (2013) studied the effect of the program across a wide range of
spending and little evidence of strong spillover effects of the program. They also
analyzed the effect of the program and found that some infrastructure variables
improved, satisfaction with neighborhood infrastructure did not change signiﬁcantly, private investment in housing stock improved, and the value of a square
meter of land in treatment neighborhoods increased by more than US$2 for every
US$1 invested by the program. The study is signiﬁcant because it is the ﬁrst to
evaluate a randomized integral program, but the authors did not conduct an in-depth
analysis to determine which components of the program are driving the effects.
There is also descriptive evidence of integral slum upgrading programs by UNHabitat under the Safer Cities Program. These integral interventions focus on
reducing crime through integral slum upgrading. They are an example of crime
prevention through environmental design, which is a policy that tries to reshape the
geographical space to reduce crime and enhance socioeconomic development. The
fundamental concept is that the physical environment affects criminal behavior and
can be changed in a way that will reduce the incidence and fear of crime (Cooke
2003).
UN-Habitat considers four key factors in these programs: the degree of social
cohesion, the extent of urban inequalities, the risks of the built environment, and the
scope of inclusiveness in urban governance. The factors are derived from six case
studies from UN-Habitat’s Safer Cities Program in Dhaka, Bangladesh, Doula,
Cameroon, Medellin, Colombia, Nairobi, Kenya, Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea,
and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The evaluations of these programs were not performed
employing experimental or quasi-experimental designs that allow for attribution of
causality to the program for the changes observed in outcomes. The methods used
were analysis of the project and national documents, together with ﬁeld visits,
interviews, and focus groups with community leaders. This qualitative evaluation is
also a valuable source of information about associations between variables.
However, a lack of counterfactuals implies that there is no benchmark against which
to compare the progress of the variables. For example, it might have been the case
that there was also some positive evolution in outcomes of untreated slums due to
the favorable economic situation.
One of the case studies reviewed in UN-Habitat (2011) within the Safer Cities
Program was of the Integral Urban Program (Programa Urbano Integral—PUI),
which was implemented by the city of Medellin starting in 2002. Two components
were at the core of the PUI: ﬁrst, the promotion of public spaces for citizens of all
economic and social levels to enjoy; and second, the promotion of public education
and culture, conceived as tools for the development of the city and society, and key
elements for inclusion and equity. The PUI was implemented in areas of the city
with low human development indexes and accentuated problems of violence and
social conﬂicts.
The most salient effects of the PUI, according to the descriptive evidence
available, were economic and social (UN-Habitat 2011). First, the integral plan
promoted economic activity in the beneﬁciary area. At the individual level, the PUI
had positive effects on employment and income, since 92 % of the workforce
activities also rose dramatically in the area: there was a 300 % increase in trade, and
with the creation of a commercial boulevard the number of businesses along the
boulevard increased from 18 to 239. The relatively high investment in social and
cultural programs was four times more than expenditure on construction of the
Metrocable (the city’s main investment in physical infrastructure). Finally, social
outcomes also improved, according to the qualitative review of the PUI. Surveys
showed a signiﬁcant reduction in rates of violence and insecurity, mainly in intrafamiliar violence and burglary. There was also evidence of new community
leadership, strengthening of social and community organizations, and increasing
levels of citizen participation.
Another important intervention in the region is the Favela-Bairro Program in
Rio, Brazil. This program started in 1994 and is now in its third phase. The ﬁrst
phase focused on urban upgrading programs implemented in 38 favelas and on
improvements in other informal settlements. The second phase began in 2000 and
introduced activities in education, health and training, community development, and
property rights recognition. The third phase, which is ongoing, is designed to help
communities with between 500 and 2500 households. The objective is to improve
the living conditions of the urban poor through a comprehensive package of
interventions including social infrastructure, land tenure, and social development.
The program also includes speciﬁc objectives such as reducing the risk of geological
and environmental accidents (mostly landslides and ﬂoods), increasing transit
access, reducing the incidence of vector-borne disease, and increasing use of public
services. The basic infrastructure component includes installing water supply
facilities, gutters, sewerage, and lighting, as well as making road and garbage
collection improvements. The social component includes construction of early child
care centers, community activity programs, and training community development
workers. The social components were mainly available in the second phase, except
for the training program. Land titling interventions, though initially planned for the
ﬁrst phase, started to be implemented in the second phase. The completion rate of
the program has been high: 284 public works and other projects were executed,
accounting for over 90 % or the programmed activities. In all, interventions were
carried out in 38 of the 54 targeted favelas.
Soares and Soares (2005) performed an ex-post evaluation of the Brazil project
employing quasi-experimental design, and re-creating a matched control group from
different sources of information to circumvent the problems of not having a baseline
pre-intervention survey. The authors report positive results of the program,
especially related to an increase in the coverage of water and garbage collection
in favelas that outpaced the comparison groups identiﬁed. The impact on sewerage
was the most signiﬁcant at the aggregate level, and an analysis by income quartile
revealed that the poorest quartiles beneﬁted more from sewerage interventions than
the richest quartiles. This heterogeneous impact was also seen with respect to water,
garbage collection, and illiteracy. The authors did not ﬁnd signiﬁcant effects on
reducing mortality due to poor sanitation conditions or homicides. Neither were any
effects on housing values detected, although that could be due to data and
planned evaluation with the timely data collection processes be performed on future
phases of the program in order to better assess its effects. More studies are needed to
assess the beneﬁts of integral upgrading programs in general and to understand
which interventions should be included in them.

5 Conclusions
The countries of Latin America and the Caribbean have strikingly high urbanization
rates in comparison with other developing regions and even with many OECD
countries. In 2010, 79 % of the LAC population was living in cities and by 2050 it is
expected that 90 % of the population will be urban. As a consequence of this
process of massive urbanization, many citizens live in informal neighborhoods with
substandard housing and urban services, as cities have not been able to meet the
needs of their fast-growing populations. More than 100 million people live in slums,
in informal settlements with unsecure tenure, and/or in dwellings with deﬁcient
urban services.
According to Bouillon (2012), closing the current housing gap in LAC will
require an investment of at least US$310 billion, or 7.8 % of the region’s GDP. At
the moment LAC devotes 1 % of GDP, on average, to public programs for housing
and urban development issues (Bouillon 2012). Meeting future housing demands
will require a coordinated effort by all stakeholders—slum dwellers, local
governments, and ﬁnancial institutions—along with massive annual investments
estimated at US$70 billion.
To guide these investments and design the associated programs targeted at
improving living standards, it is important to understand the incentives that drive
housing choices of new city migrants. Toward this end, this chapter has presented a
theoretical model that provides a key insight: city migrants face a trade-off between
the affordability of services and transport costs. Using this trade-off as a starting
point, the chapter analyzed three types of urban policies: access to housing,
transport policies, and slum upgrading.
Urbanization in the region will continue, thus ﬁlling the knowledge gap on the
best way to integrate transit and land use to develop more sustainable and accessible
urban spaces. When transit and land development are integrated, there is less
dependence on private motorization, which in turn has positive effects on equity,
congestion, and the environment (Cervero 1998). To the best of our knowledge,
however, there is scant rigorous evidence on which to base policies to support this
process. To reverse the cycle of urbanization of poverty, more research is needed on
how to prevent the formation of slums by way of formal access to housing
coordinated with public transit policies.
Regarding access to housing, a popular policy in LAC has been land titling to
formalize those living in informal settlements. There is a good body of literature
with sound identiﬁcation strategies studying such programs. Land titling has
positive effects on housing investments, negative effects on household size (less
There is weak support for the hypothesis that land titling can have positive effects
on capital investment because the dwelling can be used as collateral. One reason
may be because the access of slum dwellers to the credit market is very limited.
Also, the high legal costs associated with eviction and with obtaining a mortgage
execution might preclude mortgage credit (Galiani and Schargrodsky 2011). It is
important to assess the long-term effects of land titling to ensure that regulatory
policies enable its sustainability. It is still not clear how to incorporate the
regularized properties into formal renting and housing markets. Finally, more
research is needed on the best type of titling, registration or recording, both of which
seem to be efﬁcient options in the developed world.
The housing affordability gap in LAC is mainly driven by the low income of poor
households. Supply- and demand-side polices to close this gap have not been
thoroughly studied. There are still open questions as to the best types of subsidies or
ﬁnancial instruments to enhance home ownership among the poor and how to
promote the rental market for this segment. Policies that involve private–public
partnerships to increase the supply of affordable units are very important to expand
the supply of housing for low-income citizens. The policy response to housing
problems in LAC in terms of quality and affordability has, in most cases, ignored
rental housing as a vehicle to provide adequate housing solutions for low-income
families. The development of the rental market for low-income segments is an even
less explored area. Rigorous evaluations should be encouraged when new housing
programs are implemented to compare the cost-effectiveness of different options.
As explained in this paper, the process of rapid urbanization in LAC has resulted
in an increase in transportation demands. Better public transport links can alleviate
the housing gap because they enable the poor to move to the suburbs where land and
housing services are cheaper. Problems with road congestion and pollution are also
becoming severe in the bigger cities of LAC, where private motorization has
increased exponentially. However, to date, transport in general, and public transit
for the poor in particular, has been an understudied topic. One reason might be
because enhancing mobility has not been stated as an explicit priority in the United
Nation’s Millennium Development Goals. Another reason is the lack of systematic
statistics. Travel surveys like the ones performed in more advanced countries can be
a starting point to identify the constraints faced by low-income commuters
(affordability, accessibility, etc.).
A wide range of travel demand management policies have been applied in
different countries, ranging from vehicular restrictions to public transport
improvements, but there remains a gap in the knowledge of what works in travel
demand management in the region. Anecdotal data and descriptive statistics show
that sustainable transport reforms based on rapid bus transport have been successful
in better connecting cities and reducing pollution. The promotion of cycling through
the expansion of cycling lanes and bike-sharing facilities is becoming more
common in the region, though the take-up of such programs is still limited (IDB
2013) and there are no evaluations of their effect so far. Nor is there any
experimental design to assess the effect of different alternatives to make public
Vale Transporte program in Brazil).
Expanding public transit can have an important effect on sorting income groups
in cities and has the potential to encourage the decentralization of the urban poor
from inner-city slums and improve access to the labor market of the urban poor in
the suburbs. LAC scores low in mobility indexes, and thus a serious assessment of
transport demand to reshape cities is a very important avenue for future research.
Slums can be viewed as the ﬁrst location of rural migrants when they arrive in a
city, the place from which they explore labor opportunities. This often means being
close to the city center and living in deﬁcient housing. The problem is that in LAC
many slums have turned into a permanent and burgeoning phenomenon due to
poverty traps. In light of anticipated future urbanization, as mentioned earlier, the
integration of formal housing supply and transport systems is key to meet the
demands of new low-income migrants. Even so, slum dwellers in some cases may
choose to stay in the slums given their strong preference for the location or because
of social and economic bonds.
This paper has also examined policies to upgrade the living standards of slum
dwellers. What seems not to work is relocating entire slum areas to remote locations
or providing social housing far from the original marginal neighborhoods. Evidence
from a randomized experiment in the United States (the Moving to Opportunity
Program) and from quasi-experiments in Chile and Mexico suggests that the
beneﬁts of better housing services under such initiatives are outweighed by social
disintegration, stigmatization, and loss of work opportunities because beneﬁciaries
cannot get to their existing workplaces and have difﬁculties ﬁnding new jobs closer
to their new location. In situ upgrading, when possible, is a better option than
relocation. This is consistent with the evidence presented in Baker et al. (2005) for
Mumbai. That study used a residential location model to assess the welfare of both
an in situ slum upgrading program and a relocation program. It concluded that for
households relocated further away, the increased commuting distances wiped out
the housing beneﬁts of the program and that beneﬁciaries were better off with the
more limited housing improvement provided by the in situ intervention.
There is also already a body of knowledge on the effects of in situ housing
infrastructure upgrades. Providing better housing and housing services improves
slum dwellers’ well-being and satisfaction with life. Some interventions, like
improved water quality and improved ﬂooring or walls, have positive effects on
child health. Upgrading the walls and roof of a home can also improve a
household’s perception of security. However, these limited in situ improvements in
housing are not sufﬁcient to achieve signiﬁcant changes in the living conditions of
the urban poor and to signiﬁcantly reduce the various ailments they suffer as slum
dwellers.
What might be necessary, then, is to carry out wider slum upgrading programs
that combine housing improvements with broader interventions addressing other
major problems affecting slum dwellers. There are few evaluations of slum
upgrading interventions that exploit experimental or quasi-experimental designs,
although randomized evaluations are feasible and can be implemented in many
programs.
Given the multiple challenges and the dimension of the problems in slum areas,
large-scale coordinated programs to reshape the overall environment would seem
better suited than small-scale interventions. Integral upgrading programs have the
ability to mobilize many different actors in diverse policy areas at various levels.
These programs can give momentum to the idea that improving a neighborhood
involves addressing all the dimensions of life there, including freedom from risk of
injury, public safety, welfare, satisfaction with life, education, employment, access
to services, and effective transport networks.
However, causal investigations have been carried out for most of the integral
programs undertaken in LAC. It is critical to incorporate evaluation of integral
programs into the region’s research agenda to assess the best set of interventions. To
date, little is known about complementarities and economies of scale in delivering
urbanization programs. For example, water and sanitation could be coupled with
community strengthening to enhance social cohesion, which in turn could have
positive effects on other individual as well as community outcomes. Also, transport
interventions together with housing upgrades could improve living conditions and
increase the disposable incomes of slum dwellers.

Urban infrastructure in Latin America
and the Caribbean: public policy priorities

Abstract Latin America and the Caribbean is the most urbanized region in the
developing world. Its urbanization rate of almost 80 % is comparable to that of
high-income countries. However, cities in the region are struggling to provide the
infrastructure needed for their millions of residents to enjoy a decent quality of life.
This paper focuses on analyzing three aspects of this challenge. First, it identiﬁes the
main problems in housing and transport infrastructure in the region. Second, it
examines the effect of past interventions to improve the living standards of the
urban poor. And third, it analyzes the relationship between housing supply and
transport networks, two connected topics that shape the region’s spatial urban
patterns.

1 Introduction
Most of the world’s population today lives in cities. However, this has been true
only since 2007, when the urban population surpassed the rural population due both
to natural growth of the urban population as well as accelerated rural migration to
cities (United Nations 2009; Henderson 2002). The global urbanization process was
mainly driven by the developing world, where the urban population grew at 3.35 %

1 % (United Nations 2009).
By 2011, 53 % of the world’s population lived in cities, including 80 % of the
population in the developed world and 46 % of the population in developing
countries. However, Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) is an outlier among
lower- and middle-income regions, with a strikingly high urbanization rate of
79 %—higher even than the urbanization rate of many member countries of the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
Rural to urban migration is driven by the expectation of better opportunities and
living standards. In cities, residents and ﬁrms enjoy the beneﬁts of agglomeration
and economies of scale as well as network effects, all of which increase labor
productivity and reduce the per capita cost of providing urban services (Rauch
1993).
Yet, the expected beneﬁts of living in cities do not materialize for all. The rapid
and unplanned expansion of cities has resulted in the growth of informal
settlements, which develop because governments are unable to provide urban
services for the growing population and because the formal housing market and
transport networks cannot meet the new demands. A large proportion of the urban
poor in developing countries live in urban or peri-urban areas under conditions of
overcrowding, insecure property rights, deﬁcient urban and social services, poverty,
and exposure to crime and violence, among other socioeconomic problems.
Consequently, migration to urban areas moved the location of global poverty to the
cities, triggering the process known as the ‘‘urbanization of poverty’’ (UN-Habitat
2003). In LAC, approximately 60 % of the poor and half of the extreme poor live in
urban areas. The urbanization of poverty is projected to continue in the region,
particularly in certain areas such as Central America (Fay 2005).
Slums represent a major challenge to development given the deﬁcient provision
of urban services to them, the lack of public safety, and environmental hazards. In
addition, the geographical and social segregation of slum dwellers accentuates bad
peer effects and sometimes inﬂicts a stigma on slum dwellers that prevents them
from joining the formal labor market.
Thus, programs to avoid new informal settlements and to stop the growth of
existing ones should be of ﬁrst-order importance on the LAC research and policy
agenda. Also, governments need to urgently ﬁnd solutions to integrate the actual
slum dwellers into the formal city and solve the urban divide.
This paper identiﬁes the main problems in housing and urban infrastructure in
LAC and reviews the causal effect of past interventions within urban infrastructure
programs in the region. The ultimate goal is to understand what has worked in terms
of housing and transport and to detect gaps in knowledge to promote avenues for
future research for a more sustainable urbanization process.
The paper looks to explore what drives the decisions of households in terms of
consumption of household services and location within a city—decisions that, in
turn, shape urban patterns. Many urban poor cannot afford formal housing or are
conﬁned to live in substandard conditions close to the city center because transport
access to the formal housing market and improvement of the public transit network.
The rationale for these ﬁrst two priorities is based on the fact that the rapid and
unplanned urbanization of LAC distorted the equilibrium of housing supply and
demand, and to date that equilibrium has not been restored. There are market
failures in the formal housing market for the poor that prevent or delay this
adjustment. At the same time, in the developing world mass public transport is
deﬁcient, which affects the living standards of the urban poor. It is therefore clear
that the integration of formal housing supply and mass public transit policies are the
key elements to shape more sustainable cities in the future and accommodate the
still growing urban population.
Slums could be viewed as a ﬁrst step in the move to the city. Inner slums are
located close to the city center and might be a strategic starting point for newly
arrived poor migrants to look for a job and explore opportunities. However, as can
be seen in LAC, slums tend to be a permanent rather than a transitory phenomenon.
Therefore, the third policy priority explored in this paper is slum upgrading to
improve the living standards of slum dwellers and mitigate urban poverty.
Although the urban poverty problem is multi-causal and requires a cross-sectoral
approach, including citizen security and health for example, the scope of this paper
is limited to the main barriers to the integration of the urban poor in terms of
housing and transport. Other important socioeconomic and environmental problems
related to the urban poor are excluded from the analysis.
When studying the causal effects of interventions, identiﬁcation issues are of the
ﬁrst order of relevance. We include mainly papers that exploit experimental or
quasi-experimental settings.1 Those methods have proven to be the most accurate
for causal inference. Nevertheless, we also include important observational studies
or qualitative evaluations when more rigorous evaluations are not yet available.
Most of the programs reviewed take place in the developing world, with priority
given to LAC, unless there is no information available for developing regions, in
which case relevant papers from other regions are included.
In terms of the ﬁrst priority area, there is scant knowledge on the best way to
expand the supply of housing for the poor and promote the rental market in LAC for
low-income households. There is, however, a body of literature with sound
identiﬁcation strategies on formalizing urban poor by giving them land titles.
The second policy priority is to improve transport networks for the poor. The
most urgent area for future research is to ﬁnd ways to make mass public transit
accessible and affordable for the poor and to investigate how this can shape the
spatial patterns of the city. Policies that integrate transport reforms with supply of
housing for low-income households seem the most promising
Finally, for informal settlements, there are many papers investigating the effect
of slum upgrading programs. Proposals that involve a single intervention to improve
the living standards of the urban poor have improved the level of satisfaction of

In experimental settings, the treated and control groups are randomly selected. In quasi-experimental
designs, a variety of statistical methods is employed to choose a control group that can re-create the
of slum dwellers. It seems that integral slum upgrading programs are necessary to
produce more profound and long-lasting changes. Rigorous evaluation of integral
programs will be very useful to determine which mix of programs produces the best
outcomes.
The rest of the document is structured as follows: Section 2 sets the region in the
context of the world in terms of a wide range of housing and transport indicators.
Section 3 develops a simple spatial equilibrium approach that serves as a theoretical
framework to understand housing choices. Section 4 studies a set of programs
within the main selected policy areas: (1) access to housing, (2) transport
interventions, and (3) upgrading housing. Finally, Sect. 5 presents conclusions that
point out avenues for future research.

2 Housing and urban infrastructure in Latin America
and the Caribbean
The trend from rural to urban populations occurred earlier in developed regions and
is now the main trend in the developing world. Population growth is, therefore,
becoming largely an urban phenomenon concentrated in the developing world
(Satterthwaite 2007). Table 1 shows that among developing regions, LAC has an
exceptionally high level of urbanization (79 %) that is higher than that of Europe.

respective populations living in cities. In the years ahead, the level of urbanization is
expected to increase in all major areas of the developing world, with Africa and
Asia urbanizing more rapidly than the rest. Nevertheless, by mid-century, Africa
and Asia are still expected to have lower levels of urbanization than the more
developed regions or LAC (United Nations 2013).
Table 1 illustrates the urban explosion that took place in LAC from 1950 to 1990.
In 1950, only 40 % of the population in LAC lived in cities, while in 1990 that
proportion reached 70 %. In 2011, the urbanization rate was 79 %, and by 2050, it is
expected to rise to 90 % (United Nations 2013).
Not only is LAC the most urbanized developing region, it also has a high degree
of concentration of the population in large cities. Table 1 shows that 35 % of the
urban population lives in metropolitan areas of more than 1 million people, which is
the highest proportion in the world. LAC also has the largest concentration of megacities in the world. In 1950, there were no mega-cities in the region. Today, there are
˜
eight: Buenos Aires, Mexico City, Rio de Janeiro, and Sao Paulo (all with more than
10 million inhabitants), and Belo Horizonte, Bogota, Lima, and Santiago
(approaching 10 million inhabitants). While 9 % of the world population lives in
cities with more than 10 million inhabitants, in LAC 14 % lives in such mega-cities
(UN-Habitat 2012). There are also 55 cities in LAC with populations between 1 to 5
million people, and these cities account for 24 % of the regional population (the
world average is 22 % for this city size). These cities include Caracas, Guatemala
City, Panama City, San Salvador, and Brasilia. As a result of this rapid urbanization
over the years, mega-cities expanded exponentially and new smaller cities also
emerged.
This striking level of urbanization and urban agglomeration in LAC is a
challenge for the cities that were not prepared to absorb such population growth. As
a consequence, the slum population increased in recent decades, with a modest
decrease only during the past few years.2 Figure 1 shows that in 2010 there were
828 million slum dwellers in the developing world (one-sixth of the world’s
population), 110 million of whom lived in LAC. The proportion of the urban
population living in slums has been decreasing thanks to the rapid rate of
urbanization that more than offset the increase in slum dwellers.
One of the Millennium Development Goals (MDG) is ‘‘cities without slums’’.3 To
date, 200 million people living in cities have stopped being considered as living in

According to UN-Habitat (2003), a slum household is a group of individuals living under the same roof
and lacking one or more of the following conditions: (1) access to safe water: sufﬁcient amount of water
(20 l/person/day), at an affordable price (less than 10 % of total household income), available without
being subject to extreme effort (less than 1 h a day of walking time); (2) access to improved sanitation:
access to an excreta disposal system either in the form of a private toilet or a public toilet shared with a
reasonable number of people; (3) sufﬁcient living area: fewer than three people per habitable room; (4)
structural quality/durability of dwellings: a house built on a nonhazardous location and with a permanent
structure adequate to protect its inhabitants from the extremes of climatic conditions; and (5) security of
tenure: the right to effective protection by the State against arbitrary unlawful evictions.

The 11th MDG target is to progress toward a goal of ‘‘Cities Without Slums’’ (within the 7th Goal of
‘‘Ensuring Environmental Sustainability’’), establishing a target of improving the lives of at least 100

Note Indicator 7.10 to monitor the Millennium Development Goal Target 7.D is: by 2020 to have
achieved a signiﬁcant improvement in the lives of at least 100 million slum-dwellers. Slum population is
deﬁned as the urban population living in dwellings with at least one of these four characteristics: lack of
access to improved drinking water, lack of access to improved sanitation, overcrowding (three or more
persons per room) and dwellings made of nondurable material. Half of pit latrines are considered
improved sanitation. Trends data are not available for Oceania

slums because they gained access to water and sanitation facilities and durable
housing. As a consequence, from 2000 to 2010, the proportion of urban residents in
developing countries living in slums decreased from 46 to 36 %. However, progress is
still insufﬁcient, as the number of people moving to slums is increasing in many
regions (UN-Habitat 2011). In LAC, around 25 % of the urban population lives in
slums.
There are two MDGs closely related to cities without slums: access to safe water
and sanitation services. The MDG to halve by 2015 the population without access to
safe water with respect to 1990 will be achieved. In particular, LAC has a high level
of coverage (Table 2). However, the MDG to halve by 2015 the population without
access to sanitation services with respect to 1990 will not be achieved globally,
despite large improvements in many regions. In LAC, the provision of sanitation is

deﬁcits in urban areas of LAC: around 21 million households live in dwellings
lacking at least one basic service. Inadequate sanitation is the main infrastructure
problem, affecting 13 % of households (almost 17 million). Around 8 million
households lack piped water (and the quality of the water received by most
households is not optimal). The urban poor are the most affected: in 2009, the
percentage of poor households lacking infrastructure was six times higher than that
of high-income households. While there is almost no overcrowding or poor-quality
building materials in high-income households, these problems affect 16 % of urban
poor households (Bouillon 2012).
Tables 3 and 4 show the differential access to urban services of the ﬁrst quintile
(20 % poorest) of the income distribution with respect to the mean. This would
indicate that more pro-poor and targeted polices are needed.
Access to housing is the main problem for new urban migrants. There are scant
cross-regional statistics on home ownership, but in LAC the home ownership rates
are higher on average than in the rest of the developing world (Bouillon 2012).
Table 5 shows large disparities among countries of the region according to
household income: Nicaragua, Venezuela, Costa Rica, and Panama have home
ownership rates of more than 70 % for urban households, while Uruguay and Brazil
have rates lower than 55 %. The lowest income quintile has ownership rates far
below the mean in Uruguay, Mexico, and Brazil. The rental sector is not developed
in the region for low-income residents, so access to housing is a main policy
priority. Rental tenure rates in LAC are even lower than in other developing
countries in Africa and Asia (Andreasen 1996; Gilbert et al. 1997).
The last topic addressed in this paper is transport systems, which are a pillar for
economic development and growth. Within cities, the availability and quality of
transportation shapes spatial patterns and is tightly linked to the supply of housing
services. When there is an inﬂux of migrants in cities with deﬁcient public transit
networks, the poor have to live close to their jobs in the city center with deﬁcientquality housing (inner-city slums), or in the suburbs, spending a lot of time and
money commuting. Also, as in the housing sector, in areas not reached by formal
public transport, informal suppliers emerge to meet the demand for transportation at
very high prices.
Although transport is important, no target for transport was included in the
MDGs, and there are few statistics to make international comparisons. Thus, we use
different sources, including certain statistics published by the World Bank, data
from some relevant cities, and a mobility index developed by a private company.
Figure 2 shows the Little (2014) Urban Mobility Index for a sample of 84 cities
across the world. This index reﬂects the state of mobility in terms of maturity and
performance.4 Western Europe ranks highest among all regions surveyed, followed
by South/Eastern Europe. These regions lead both in the mobility and the maturity
components of the index. North America scores below average due to its high
4

The mobility score per city ranges from 0 to 100 index points; the maximum of 100 points is deﬁned by
the best performance of any city in the sample for each criterion. See Little (2014) for a detailed

dependence on cars. The average score of the cities of LAC included in the sample5
is also slightly below the world average, due to relatively low mobility performance.
Figure 3 shows the mean number of daily trips per person and mode of transport.
In Europe, on average 40 % of the trips use individual motorized transport, 24 %
use public transport, and 36 % walk or cycle. There is a lot of heterogeneity among
the cities: for example, in London the use of public transport accounts for 42 % of
trips, while in Amsterdam 58 % of the trips are by walking or (especially) cycling.
In LAC, motorization is very high (28 % of trips are in private cars or taxis) but the
largest number of trips (42 %) is by public transport.
Table 6 presents more comprehensive statistics for all LAC countries. It shows
that LAC is one of the most motorized regions of the world, but does not rank so
high in terms of transportation infrastructure (low road density and very low
percentage of paved roads). As incomes in the region increased and private vehicles
became relatively cheaper, more middle- and high-income individuals had access to
cars. There was indeed exponential growth of motorization in the region, similar to
the trend experienced earlier in the developed world but much faster (Cervero et al.
2013). In 2010, there were 183 motor vehicles per 1000 inhabitants in LAC, more
than the world average of 176 and almost 4 times more than the average for lowand middle-income countries. Also in LAC in 2010 there were 2.5 new motor
vehicle registrations for every new child born (Hidalgo and Huizenga 2013).

Motorization results in congestion, air pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions. In
addition, motorization reduces the physical activity implied by nonmotorized modes
of transport (cycling and walking), which in turn increases obesity and related
illnesses. Costs of negative externalities are estimated to be around 18 % of the
average income of 15 selected cities in the region (Hidalgo and Huizenga 2013).
Clearly, cars are not affordable for all in LAC. Table 6 shows that in most
countries in the region the probability of having a car when belonging to the ﬁfth
income quintile (20 % richest) is more than 10 times higher than for the ﬁrst income

ownership. Consequently, the urban poor rely strongly on public mass transport or
nonmotorized transport (walking and cycling).
In many cities in LAC public mass transport is deﬁcient. The coverage of metro
lines and availability of passenger cars is very low in the region in comparison with
developed cities (Fig. 4; Table 6).6
The cheapest mass public transport is the bus (CAF-OMU 2009), and it is used
widely in LAC. However, the cost of bus fares (usually subsidized) consumes a
signiﬁcant proportion of the income of the poor. Figure 5 shows the cost of 50 bus
rides as a percentage of a month’s minimum salary for selected LAC cities, New York,
and London. In LAC those earning the minimum wage (or less) spend 16 % (or more)
of their salary on transport, while in New York and London that ﬁgure is around 5 %.
So the burden of transportation on the expenses of the poor is very high in LAC.
From this section it can be concluded that LAC is an outlier among developing
regions for its high urbanization rate. The region has many deﬁcits with respect to
housing and transport. Inequality in access to urban services is very high in some
countries. Therefore, polices should facilitate access to the formal housing market and
quality housing services for the poor. There seems to be an imperative need to improve
mobility in LAC cities. Deﬁcient public transit disproportionally affects the urban poor,
as it hinders their socioeconomic development and conditions their housing choices.

3 Theoretical framework
This section employs a simple city model to provide a conceptual framework for the
discussion on housing and transport infrastructure. We employ the traditional spatial
Alonso–Mills–Muth framework (AMM) (Alonso 1964; Mills 1972; Muth 1969).

The basic idea of the AMM model is that cities have a central business district
where residents work.7 To focus on residential housing choices, we assume that the
central business district is collapsed to a single point at the city center (takes up no
space).
There is a dense network of radial roads that are used daily by the residents to
commute from home to work in the central business district. Let x be the distance
from the house to the city center. Households are identical, of size one, and earn
the same income working in the central business district (later we introduce
heterogeneity). They consume a basket of two goods: c is consumption of a
composite nonhousing good and q is consumption of units of housing services.
This is a rental model, so q refers to rented housing services.8 Most models use
q as the area of the housing good consumed (square meters of the house rented),
but we interpret q as a unit that measures housing services that is both the
quantity and quality of the house (material of ﬂoors and walls, sanitation and
water services, security of tenure, and other housing amenities). There is a level qs
below which a dwelling is considered substandard (for example, think of qs as the
threshold below which a household lives in a slum according to the criteria
described in Sect. 2).

7

Although the framework can be adapted to increasingly polycentric cities, it is also useful in terms of
the main trade-offs households face when choosing their location within the city.

8

A household chooses the composition of its consumption basket, given its budget
constraint, to achieve the maximum utility level possible. When choosing q, it will
also have to choose x (location). The utility function is U(c, q), strictly quasiconcave.
Each household earns an income y working in the central business district and
incurs transport costs T(x) that increase with the radial distance x from the central
business district.9 Commuting costs have two parts: the monetary cost (gasoline and
car expenses or public transport fare) and the opportunity cost of the time spent
commuting. For now we only include monetary costs and assume that there is only
one transport technology.
After paying transport costs, the disposable income is y - T(x), to be spent on
nonhousing consumption c and on housing services q. The price of the composite
nonhousing good is assumed to be the same everywhere and is set to be equal to
US$1. The price of housing services is p(x).
There is a maximum utility level that can be achieved by every household.
Following Brueckner (1987), when substituting for nonhousing consumption in the
budget constraint, the condition that the maximized utility equals U is
maxðqÞ vðy À TðxÞ À pðxÞq; qÞ ¼ U:

ð1Þ

The condition for locational equilibrium states that all the residents should have
the same level of utility in their locations. Otherwise, there are incentives to move to
other areas that give a higher utility. To achieve this, the price of the housing
services should vary according to the distance to the central business district.
Housing services close to the central business district are more expensive, which
offsets the expense that households located far away incur for commuting. This is a
very important prediction of the model.
More formally, from Eq. (1) we can establish two conditions to ﬁnd the solution
for the unknowns p and q for every given x, and the parameters. The ﬁrst-order
condition for q is
vq ðy À TðxÞ À pðxÞq; qÞ
¼ p:
vc ðy À TðxÞ À pðxÞq; qÞ

ð2Þ

The second condition is that the resulting consumption must give utility U:
vðy À TðxÞ À pðxÞq; qÞ ¼ U:

ð3Þ

There are multiple solutions for this system of equations. In Fig. 6 we can see
two possible ones. For utility level U1, at a given distance to the central business
district x1 we can plot a tangent budget constraint with intercept y - T(x1). The
absolute value of the resulting slope of the budget constraint will be the price of the
unit of housing services at that distance: p(x1). If now we consider rental housing

For example, if residents pay $t per kilometer, we can represent the commuting costs with a linear

services at a distance x0 (closer to the central business district), the intercept of the
budget constraint would be y - T(x0) and its slope p(x0) would be steeper, meaning
that closer to the city center (x0 \ x1) the price of housing services is more
expensive p(x0) [ p(x1).
Figure 6 already gives us a hint of the main relationships of interest: between p
and x, which determines the price schedule of housing services within the city, and
between q and x, which determines housing consumption within the city. We can get
an expression for both of them by totally differentiating the last equation with
respect to x and replacing vq(Á) = pvc(Á). This very important relationship is called
the bid-rent gradient and represents the main trade-off between the cost of housing
and transport:
op
Tx
¼À :
ox
q

ð4Þ

As the transport cost is an increasing function of the distance, the price of
housing services is a decreasing function of distance x to the central business district
(as shown in Fig. 6). Commuting cost differences within an urban area must be
balanced by differences in the price of housing services.10
The other important relationship is between x and q:

From Eq. (4) we can also deduce that as long as T(x) is concave, the house pricing curve is convex:
indifference curves, and the derivative of the price of housing services with respect
to the distance to the central business district is also negative (Eq. 4). This means
that the further one moves away from the central business district, the more housing
services one consumes.
3.2 Supply analysis
Brueckner (1987) provides one example for a supply-side analysis. In his
model, housing services q are restricted to the size of the house rented.
Building developers use a constant-returns-to-scale technology and there is free
entry into this market. The model provides two key insights: (1) the height of
buildings, and (2) the decrease in the rent of land according to the distance
from the central business district. As a direct implication, it can be derived that
population density also decreases with the distance away from the central
business district.
The main predictions of this simple model up to now are the following: (1) prices
of housing services decrease with the distance from the central business district to
offset the fact that households in suburban areas incur higher transport costs; (2)
households can consume more housing services far from the central business
district, (3) the rental prices of land also decrease with the distance from the central
business district to incentivize developers to build in suburban areas, and as a
consequence developers get spatially uniform zero proﬁts; (4) buildings are higher
close to the central business district; and (5) the closer to the central business
district, the higher the population density.
3.3 Extending the demand side to different income groups
Allowing for different income groups gives rise to different spatial sorting patterns
that strongly depend on individual preferences (from which we abstract) and
transportation costs. One interesting case is that of linear transportation costs,
T(x) = tx, which are the same for all income groups. In this context one can show
that the poor will live in the city center while the rich will move to the suburbs
(Fig. 7). The rationale is that the poor consume less housing services and thus
outbid the rich at locations closer to the central business district (see Hartwick et al.
1976 for inﬁnite income groups).
This result of the concentration of the poor in the city center is, however, very
sensitive to the assumption that transport costs are only monetary and all income
groups use the same transport technology.11 To see this formally, let there be two
income groups, the poor P and the rich R. The poor have income yP, the rich yR and
yR [ yP. Both the poor and the rich consume composite good ci and housing
services qi and i = R, P. Assume that there are two modes of transportation that
11

Differences in preferences can also affect the sorting. For example, Brueckner et al. (1999) show that
if the rich have preferences for amenities that are in the city center, such as historical buildings, they

both income groups can use: public transport (e.g., a bus), with ﬁxed cost fb,12
variable costs cb per kilometer, and opportunity cost tbyi per kilometer; or an
automobile, which causes ﬁxed cost fa, variable cost ca, and opportunity cost tayi.
We assume that the car is a more expensive mode of transportation than the bus, i.e.,
fa [ fb, ca [ cb, but is also faster, i.e., tb [ ta. An individual of group I, choosing
transport k 2 fb; ag; then faces the following maximization problem:
maxUðqi ; ci Þ s:t: yi À f k À ck x À tk yi x ! qi p þ ci :

ð6Þ

As before, rich and poor have to be indifferent between the locations they choose.
This is accomplished, in equilibrium, by the price being a decreasing function of the
distance to the central business district x. Indeed, an application of the envelope
theorem shows that the bid-rent gradient for an individual of group i using
transportation mode k is given by (like Eq. 6)

It remains to investigate under which conditions members of the two groups use
public transport or decide to use a car. Let xÃ be the distance from the center where
i

12
The introduction of ﬁxed costs allows for a richer set of equilibria in that members of the same group

of income group i, while otherwise the use of a car is optimal for all locations x ! xÃ :
i
The sorting of the two different income groups depends on the means of transport
they use, as this determines the bid-rent gradient.13 Intuitively, the rich have a
comparative advantage with respect to the poor to live in the city center, as their
opportunity cost of time is higher. This comparative advantage is attenuated once
the rich have access to a car, which provides a more efﬁcient way of commuting. It
seems thus reasonable to assume that there may be some parameter values for which
the rich prefer to locate in the city center, whereas the poor live in suburban areas.
First, consider the case in which both income groups use public transport. The
rich will live in the city center, while the poor live in the suburban area, if and only
if the bid-rent gradient of the rich is steeper than the bid-rent gradient of the poor:
cb þ tb yR
cb þ t b yP
[
:
hR
hP

ð9Þ


If this is the case, the rich will outbid the poor until some distance x from the
center. This condition is equivalent to saying that the elasticity of demand for
housing services with respect to income is less than the elasticity of the marginal
cost of transportation with respect to income (for empirical estimates of the
elasticities involved, see LeRoy and Sonstelie 1983; Glaeser et al. 2008).
On the other hand, suppose that xÃ (distance from the central business district
R
where the rich are indifferent between the two modes of transport) lies within the
city’s boundaries (but xÃ does not). Then the rich ﬁnd it optimal at some distance to
P
use the car. For the rich who use the car to live further from the center than the poor
who use the bus, the following condition has to hold:
ca þ t a yR
cb þ t b yP
[
:
hR
hP

ð10Þ

Again this condition can be related to the elasticities of the demand of housing
services and marginal transportation costs with respect to income.
3.3.1 Spatial sorting
Consider a situation where the poor never ﬁnd it optimal to use a car, whereas the
rich do ﬁnd it best to use a car for distances x ! xÃ : Assume that Eqs. (9) and (10)
R
hold. Then, depending on the parameters, there are two possible equilibria: in one
13
We restrict attention to the demand side, in the spirit of LeRoy and Sonstelie (1983) and Glaeser et al.
bid-rent gradient is steeper when using the bus than the bid-gradient of the poor. The
rich prefer to live in the center as it minimizes their opportunity cost from
commuting. Around the rich center, there is a circle of poor who use the bus, which
is encircled by a suburban area inhabited by the rich with cars. The existence of this
latter layer is guaranteed by Eq. (10), which ensures that the bid-rent gradient of the
rich using a car exceeds the gradient of the poor using a bus for sufﬁciently far
locations.
A second possible equilibrium is one in which all the rich move away from the
city center and only the poor live there. Intuitively this will be the case when costs
for public transport are relatively high, which reduces the number of rich who want
to use public transport. In this case, the poor compete so ﬁercely for the city center
locations that all the rich prefer to move to suburban areas and use a car.
Figure 8 represents de price bid gradients for the different groups (subscripts)
and means of transport (superscripts). The equilibria described are Fig. 8a, b,
respectively.

We now consider how two alternative policy interventions affect the sorting of the
groups in the city and the consumption of housing services. We show that making
public transport more efﬁcient (e.g., by introducing a faster means of transport such
as a subway/train or rapid bus transport, or by lowering the price of the bus) can
induce the poor to live further from the central business district and therefore have
access to better housing services.
3.4.1 Introducing a more efﬁcient public means of transport
Suppose we are in a situation in which the poor live in the city center and use public
transport, whereas the rich live in the suburban area and use cars. Consider a
government intervention that introduces a new means of transport such as a subway
or rapid bus transport system (represented by c in Fig. 8c) that is both cheaper and
more efﬁcient than both the standard bus system and the car. In this case, both rich
and poor will use the same means of transport. If Eq. (9) holds—that is, the
elasticity of demand for housing services is less than the elasticity of the marginal
cost of transportation—the rich will relocate to the city center, whereas the poor will
live in suburban areas. This is due to the comparative advantage the rich hold
because of their higher opportunity costs.
3.4.2 Decreasing the cost of public transport
Consider again the situation in which the poor live in the city center and use the bus
only, whereas the rich live in suburban areas and use the car only. Lowering the cost
of the bus, will increase the distance xÃ that makes it worthwhile for the rich to use
R
the car, whereas the poor will still take the bus for any distance. Reducing
commuting costs for the poor will, ceteris paribus, lead to an increase in the demand
for housing services from the poor, as this is a normal good (and lowering the
transport cost for the poor is analogous to increasing their income). Consider then
the poor living at the boundary with the rich. Having a higher income and a higher
demand will increase the price bid for housing services at this location and thus the
poor will outbid the rich. This is true for some area around the boundary. As a
response, the rich at the boundary will be urged to move outward, thereby increasing
the price at these locations. There are then two possible outcomes of this change:
either the rich get concentrated in a smaller area of suburbia and suffer a utility loss
whereas the poor’s locations extend further from the center (Fig. 8d),14 or some of
the rich decide to relocate to the city center. Which of these two possibilities obtains
depends on the magnitude of the decrease of bus transport costs.

14

Following the framework of the previous section, when the expected income in
urban areas is higher than in rural areas, there will be an increase in the urban
population and the equilibrium of housing supply and demand will be distorted.
Excess demand for housing services will increase prices, which will in turn
incentivize builders to expand the housing supply to reach a new equilibrium in a
larger city.
There are market failures in the formal housing market for the poor that in reality
prevent or delay this adjustment. The proliferation of slums in LAC after the rapid
and unplanned urbanization of recent decades shows that there is a serious problem
in access to formal housing by low-income segments of the population. Thus,
formalization of the urban poor is the ﬁrst policy priority studied.
The model presented clearly shows the trade-off between the price of housing
services and transport costs. We also examined the importance of public transport
policies in shaping the spatial sorting of income groups and affecting their
consumption of housing services. If the public transit system is more efﬁcient and/or
affordable for the poor, according to the framework presented, we expect a
decentralization of this group that would increase their capacity to consume housing
services. Therefore, the second policy priority studied is improving transport
networks to achieve a more sustainable and equitable transport system.
Enhancing access to formal housing and improving public transport for the poor
can potentially avoid the formation of new slums and attenuate the growth of
existing ones. However, there are still millions of people living in slums, so the third
policy priority studied is slum upgrading to improve the living standard of people
living in informal settlements.
4.1 Housing
4.1.1 Access to formal housing
When the formal housing market cannot cope with a rapid increase in demand,
many poor migrants look for housing solutions in the informal market, including
owning or renting a house or subdivision of a dwelling built illegally on irregularly
developed land, or occupying land or dwellings in irregular places (usually in slums
or squatter settlements).
To understand why the poor cannot access the formal housing market, supply and
demand problems need to be considered. On the supply side, the private sector may
not respond if it lacks incentives to go down-market, either because it is less
proﬁtable than serving wealthier markets, and access to credit and capital is scarce,
or because there is unfair competition from informal land developers and from
people who build their own homes. In addition, there may be constraints on scale,
technology, or inputs (such as land availability), or regulation costs and taxes may
to transform demand for housing into effective demand, (2) the lack of satisfactory
guarantees to qualify for mortgage loans, and (3) the lack of documentation to prove
permanent earnings given that many low-income families work in the informal
sector.
Bouillon et al. (2012) study the demand side in a sample of cities in LAC. They
classify the affordability gap according to several constraints: low income, poverty
induced if buying a house, high interest rate of mortgages, lack of documents to
prove income, or high housing prices. They detect an overall gap of 43 % of
households in 41 LAC cities. Insufﬁcient income is the most common factor
preventing households from affording a house in the formal market. In the most
expensive cities, the main problem is the inability to document income and the high
prices of private sector dwellings. The interest rate does not seem to be an important
factor contributing to the affordability gap. Bouillon et al. (2012) show that the
˜
cities with the highest affordability gap are Caracas, Lima, Buenos Aires, Sao Paulo,
Santo Domingo, San Pedro Sula, Managua, Rio de Janeiro, Curitiba, and La Paz.
Policies promoting income growth and redistribution policies in cities with high
inequality are needed to mitigate the affordability constraint. Other solutions are
supply-side programs, such as public housing and subsidies, or demand-side
programs, such as housing allowances or cash transfers. Another alternative is to
promote the rental market, which is far less popular in LAC than in the OECD
countries.
The next section reviews the main policies applied to formalize low-income
households.
4.1.2 Land titling and property rights
A common characteristic of slum dwellers is that they live in houses with unsecure
property rights or they lack a title altogether. In the model, a house that has insecure
property rights is represented by a q lower than qs, where qs is the housing services
threshold below which a dwelling is considered substandard. This is a consequence
of the lack of planning for urban growth together with the inability of land and
mortgage markets to reach these populations. Besley and Ghatak (2009) classify
property rights into two types: use rights (the owner’s right to use a good or asset for
consumption and income generation, and transfer rights (the owner’s right to
transfer a good or asset to another party as a sale, gift, or bequest). When property
rights are effective, it means mainly that the ownership structures are well-deﬁned.
There are two main channels through which effective property rights can affect
economic development (De Soto 2001). The ﬁrst is by encouraging private housing
investments, as insecure property rights usually weaken the incentive for owners to
make long-term capital investments or to plan for the future. Also, secured tenure is
sometimes a precursor to public investment, since government agencies are more
likely to invest in extending public services (e.g., water, drainage, or sewerage
networks) once the dwellers regularize their temporary or illegal situation (Gulyani
and Talukdar 2008). The second channel is related to the income-generation
productive projects, increasing labor productivity and income, or in further housing
upgrades. The lack of property rights makes investments in untitled parcels highly
illiquid. Moreover, it prevents poor families from the possibility of having a
valuable insurance and savings tool that could provide protection during bad times
and retirement, forcing them instead to rely on extended family members and
offspring as insurance mechanisms (Galiani and Schargrodsky 2010).
In recent years, many governments throughout the developing world have
undertaken land-titling programs that mainly involved titling public (or sometimes
private) tracts of land to their current occupants (Galiani and Schargrodsky 2011).
The evaluation of the causal effects of property rights, however, is a difﬁcult task, as
their allocation is typically endogenous. Usually, the allocation of property rights is
not random but based on wealth, family characteristics, individual effort, previous
investment levels, or other mechanisms that make the groups that acquire those
rights different than those that do not. There is already a group of papers that
overcome this identiﬁcation problem by exploiting different quasi-experimental
designs or natural experiments that provide exogenous sources of variation in land
titles.
Galiani and Schargrodsky (2010) exploit a natural experiment in the allocation of
land titles in Argentina. In 1981, squatters occupied a piece of land in a poor
suburban area of Buenos Aires. In 1984, a law was passed expropriating the former
owners’ land in order to title the occupants. While some original owners accepted
the government compensation, others opted to dispute the compensation payment in
the Argentine courts, which are extremely slow. Both groups share the same
household pretreatment characteristics, live next to each other, and inhabit identical
parcels. Since the decision of the original owners to accept or dispute the
expropriation payment was uncorrelated to the squatter characteristics, these
different decisions by the former owners generated an exogenous allocation of
property rights across squatters.
The authors ﬁnd that families that received a title substantially increased housing
investments (for example, the constructed surface increased by 12 %, while an
overall index of housing quality rose by 37 %). Land titling also reduced household
size to an average of 5.11 members compared to 6.06 members for families still
living on untitled parcels. This was due to the fact that the titled households were
more nuclear families (less presence of extended family members), and because of
reduced fertility of the household heads. In addition, the children from the
households that reduced fertility show signiﬁcantly better educational achievement,
with an average of 0.69 more years of schooling and twice the completion rate of
secondary education (53 versus 26 %). No signiﬁcant impact on labor market
outcomes was found.
Regarding the impact of land titles on the credit market, the study found no
effects on access to credit cards and banking accounts or to nonmortgage formal
credit. Indeed, families in this area had very little access to formal credit (less than
10 % had access). Access to credit was higher for informal credit from relatives,
credits (only 4 % of the treated households had ever received a mortgage loan).
Another study of the effects of land titles using a quasi-experimental design is by
Field (2005), who exploited the variation in ownership status induced by a nationwide titling program in Peru in which 1.2 million property titles were distributed to
urban squatters on public land between 1996 and 2003. Making use of differences
across regions induced by the timing of the program and differences across target
populations in the level of pre-program ownership rights, Field performed a
difference-in-differences analysis comparing the change in housing investment
before and after the program among participating households with the change
among nonparticipants. Field constructed a panel using cross-sectional data with
retrospective questions. The results indicate that strengthening property rights in
urban slums had a signiﬁcant effect on residential investment: the rate of housing
renovation rose by more than two-thirds of the baseline level.
As in the case of Galiani and Schargrodsky (2010), Field (2005) found that the
greater incentives to invest were not associated with an improvement in credit
access due to the titling program, but rather to a reduced threat of eviction. In
particular, there was a signiﬁcant increase in renovations ﬁnanced out of pocket and
in total investment among nonborrowing households.
Field and Torero (2003) relied on matching methods for their identiﬁcation
strategy using a survey of households in Peru with detailed credit information (they
exploited the same Peruvian land titling program as Field). They found very small
effects of titles on the credit market, with property titles associated with approval
rates 12 % higher when titles were requested in public banks for construction
material loans, and no relationship between titles and approval decisions otherwise.
However, the authors could not rule out that this small effect was due to other
unobservable characteristics affecting the creditworthiness of titled and untitled
applicants.
Once again, exploiting the same quasi-experimental setting in Peru, Field (2007)
examined the effect of land titles on the labor market. She found that households
with no legal claim to property spent an average of 13.4 h per week maintaining
informal tenure security, reﬂecting a 14 % reduction in household labor supply.
Household members were also 40 % more likely to work inside of their homes.
Field claims that the positive effect on employment was due to the reduced need to
stay at home to informally secure it (home security demands), a need faced by the
untitled. Galiani and Schargrodsky (2011) claim that the labor market context is
important in interpreting the effect of titles on employment, since in the setting
studied in Argentina the unemployment rate was very high, which could be the
reason why they did not ﬁnd an effect of titling on employment. Field (2003) also
interprets her ﬁnding of a smaller household size for the titled as demanding less
security. Another interpretation of smaller household size for the titled is that when
there are no formal property rights, it is easier to keep informal property rights in
case of divorce or death when the extended family lives in the dwelling. Also,
households with secure rights can use the house as insurance for the future, whereas
housing investments, negative effects on household size, and positive effects on
child education. Effects on the labor market are not conclusive. There is weak
support for the hypothesis that land titling can have positive effects on capital
investment because the dwelling can be used as collateral. The reason could be due
to the very limited access of slum dwellers to the credit market. Another reason
could be that the high legal costs of eviction and executing a mortgage might
preclude mortgaged credit (Galiani and Schargrodsky 2011).
There are different types of land titling, and we still do not know which one is
optimal for each case. More studies are needed to study the effect of different types
of land titles and the degree of titling. UN-Habitat (2007), for example, advocates
various interim occupancy rights such as granting nontransferable short-term leases,
collective property rights, use of community land trusts, and protection against
eviction. Galiani and Schargrodsky (2011) point out that the main decision should
˜
be in terms of individual recording or registration. Arrunada and Garoupa (2005)
studied the relative efﬁciency of these two systems and found evidence that, at least
in developed countries, registration is more efﬁcient (with efﬁciency increasing with
the frequency of land transactions).
4.1.3 Promoting home ownership for the poor
There has been a battery of supply-side policies to make housing affordable for lowincome households in LAC. Unlike the case of land titling, however, there are scant
evaluations on the effect of supply-side policies. The basic policy is to give the poor a
new house at a subsidized price either where they live in substandard conditions or
relocate them. This policy can be seen as an attempt to solve the housing problem
through direct intervention in the form of a capital housing subsidy (UN-Habitat 2003).
These initiatives usually take the form of relocation programs in which
households are allocated completely new, prebuilt dwellings at a small cost or for
free. As such, these programs simultaneously incorporate a number of the elements
of slum upgrading. In the 1970s it was the State in charge of building the housing,
but in 1977 Chile pioneered an innovative program to give incentives to the private
sector to build those houses and at the same time promote demand by providing
subsidies to low-income households to buy them. The subsidy was allocated to
families that were both poor and prepared to help themselves. The test of the latter
was their willingness to accumulate savings; the longer their savings record and the
greater their savings, the more likely they were to get a subsidy. Major elements of
the Chilean housing subsidy model spread to other LAC countries, notably
´
˜
Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, and Panama (Held 2000; Perez-Inigo 1999). In
1994, South Africa adopted a similar kind of policy (the Reconstruction and
Development Programme) that provided nearly 2 million houses.
In Chile there was a massive investment in subsidized housing through which
more than a million Chileans moved out of slum neighborhoods and become
property owners (Salcedo 2011). Marcano and Ruprah (2008) performed an
evaluation of the Chilean Progressive Housing Program, a public housing initiative
mortgage) was inappropriate to target the poor. In addition, they found that although
the program had signiﬁcant positive effects on housing conditions (access to water,
sewerage, and electricity), it had a negative effect on overcrowding, and had no
discernible effects on welfare indicators (poverty, school attendance, occupation
ratio, etc.). This could be due to high residential segregation, as the public housing
was in remote locations very far from job opportunities. Following the analytical
framework in Sect. 3, the poor would not move further out because they usually
cannot afford the transport cost to go to work. Salcedo (2011) pointed to positive
effects from this policy in terms of living conditions, but also noted concerns about
stigmatization and social cohesion.
Another example of a relocation experience can be found in Cattaneo et al.
(2006), who analyzed the performance of the Mexican We Start Your Home
(Iniciamos Tu Casa) Program. This program involved providing new houses to poor
inhabitants, but the houses were located far from the city center. A year after the
program started, a large proportion of the participants had abandoned the houses;
moreover, those who remained said that, although housing conditions were better,
the new neighborhoods had poor access to public goods and general infrastructure.
Promoting home ownership is very expensive if the State has to subsidize the
total value of the dwelling. An option usually available for medium- and highincome segments is a mortgage, which in the case of the poor can be partly
subsidized. The problem is that the penetration of ﬁnancial services among lowincome groups remains very limited: the mortgage-debt-to-GDP ratio is 3 % in
Brazil, 5 % in India, and 10 % in Mexico. In contrast, the ratio is 72 % in the
United States (Magowan 2008). Among low-income groups it is more common to
ﬁnance housing through informal channels, such as cash from relatives and friends
or resources from cooperatives.
Some countries have implemented government-supported liquidity facilities,
such as the Cagamas program in Malaysia, Sociedad Hipotecaria Federal in Mexico,
and the Mortgage Reﬁnance Company in Egypt (Hoek-Smit 2009). There are no
rigorous evaluations of these programs, but the qualitative evidence available shows
that these solutions might help solve housing problems, though they do not seem to
work for the very poor either.15
We conclude that promoting house ownership should be in situ or close to the
central business district. Incentives to the private sector to build cheap houses in
scale would help increase the supply of housing for low-income families. The
location of the new houses is key for the success of the program. Still, access to the
ﬁnancial market is very limited for the poor, so liquidity facilities are of little help
for this population segment.
4.1.4 Promoting the rental market
Historically, governments in LAC have focused on home ownership. The reason for
this can be based on a perception that home ownership brings about greater
15

ultimately better labor outcomes. However, there is no conclusive empirical
evidence of this. As detailed in Sect. 2, the rate of home ownership is very high on
average in LAC in comparison with other regions (UN-Habitat 2003). The rental
sector in most LAC countries is small—typically less than one-ﬁfth of all
households rent (IDB 2012).
To promote the rental market, there should ﬁrst be units available for rent for
poorer population segments. In the developed world there have been programs that
built public housing to rent to low-income families. Those dwellings are usually
managed by local authorities and the rents are capped to a certain percentage of the
income of the household. In the United States this has been a popular and by all
accounts successful policy (Sinai and Waldfogel 2005). However, some authors
point to the deterioration of this type of accommodation over time, as the dwellings
are sometimes poorly managed and located in disadvantaged neighborhoods
(O’Sullivan 2009).
Another supply-side policy used in the United States has been preferential tax
treatment for the construction of low-cost rental units. A very popular US program
has been the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit (LIHTC), which was introduced in
1986 and has since expanded. The LIHTC is an indirect federal subsidy that gives
tax incentives for investors in affordable housing by reducing upfront costs. The
program has created 75,000 new apartments annually in recent years and is
considered one of the most successful rental supply programs (NAHB 2011).
European countries have used other programs to encourage private investment in
affordable housing, such as preferred interest rates or direct grants.
On the demand side, OECD countries have used two strategies: rent supplements
and housing allowances (Andrews et al. 2011). Rent supplements top up the
remaining cost of the rent after exceeding 30 % of the household income (Bouillon
2012). Housing allowances are vouchers that can be used in any place and do not
require any direct contract with a landlord. It is possible to have minimal condition
or size standards to ensure the program is not supporting poor quality housing. The
subsidy payment similarly uses a percentage of income, such as 30 %, but adds
another element, which is a ‘‘percentage of gap’’ between the 30 % level and actual
market rent. Usually both strategies coexist.
An interesting rental voucher program was Moving to Opportunity (MTO),
launched in 1994 by the US Department of Housing and Urban Development. Its
goal was to make housing in better neighborhoods affordable to low-income
households. Even though its focus was not on access to housing, it is worth
reviewing this program given its design and results. The idea was to improve the
employment, education, and health of low-income families living in poor
neighborhoods with poverty rates of 40 % or more by providing them with
residential mobility. Over 3 years, roughly 4200 families from ﬁve major cities—
Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York—were recruited to
participate. MTO allocated vouchers to occupy houses in better locations (with less
than 10 % of poverty incidence). The winners of vouchers (treatment group) were
vouchers experienced improvements in multiple measures of well-being relative to
the control group, including safety, health, and behavioral problems among boys.
There were no signiﬁcant short-run effects of vouchers on the employment,
earnings, or welfare receipt of household heads. Katz et al. (2005) found mixed
effects on crime while Katz et al. (2007) found that 4–7 years after the lottery,
families offered vouchers lived in safer neighborhoods than families not offered
vouchers. The program also improved the mental health of adults and young women
but no change in economic self-sufﬁciency was identiﬁed.
Galiani et al. (2012) analyzed the MTO program by combining the experimental
data with a structural model to estimate a location choice model. The authors used
the random variation in the rents of households to estimate the model. They
performed interesting policy exercises to investigate whether more stringent
location restrictions are successful in changing exposure to certain neighborhood
characteristics, such as a low poverty rate in the neighborhood of residence. In the
case of the MTO program, the poverty rate for the receiving neighborhoods was less
than 10 % and take-up was around 50 %. Galiani et al. (2012) estimate that only
13 % of households would use the subsidy under a more stringent restriction that
limits subsidy use to neighborhoods with a poverty rate under 5 %. An important
implication of this is that more stringent location constraints designed with the goal
of exposing the target population to lower neighborhood poverty rates could end up
reducing the take-up of the program and the average poverty rate to which the
treated group is exposed to (due to less take-up).
The aim of the MTO program was to expose households in poor neighborhoods
to a better environment, rather than improve the housing infrastructure. In practice,
a program like this is very unlikely to be carried out in LAC. Mixing the population
from ‘‘good’’ and ‘‘bad’’ neighborhoods would indeed decrease the segregation
measures and negative neighborhood effects. However, for relocation interventions
to be sustainable, slum dwellers would need to have incentives to stay in the new
location (such as economic opportunities and better urban services). In the
developing world there have been no experiences of moving households to lowpoverty neighborhoods (like the MTO program), but as described before, in some
circumstances efforts were made to move entire slum populations to a safer area.
Such experiences have proven costly in social and ﬁnancial terms.
4.2 Transport systems
Transportation is a pillar of economic development and affects the productivity and
spatial patterns of cities in many dimensions. First, following the analytical
framework of Sect. 3, transport costs together with the price of housing services
determine the location of households in cities. As stated earlier, there is a trade-off
between the price of housing services and transport costs.
Second, the process of rapid urbanization has resulted in an increase in
transportation demands (Gilles and Turner 2012). Problems with road congestion
and pollution have come up, and these problems are more severe in LAC than in
opportunity cost of time). However, when one person more commutes by car, there
is a negative congestion externality, as trafﬁc is slowed down. Thus, in the model,
the private cost of commuting is lower than the social cost. (See Brueckner et al.
2011 for an extension of the model to the theoretical include congestion.)
We detail different ways of correcting the market failure brought about by
congestion. Regarding the ﬁrst impact of transport systems, we review alternatives
to eliminate the urban divide and improve the links from poor suburbs to city
centers, as well as policies that improve transport infrastructure.
4.2.1 Sustainable urban transport
First let us consider all the transportation options available in cities. There are four
types of urban modes of transport: (1) motorized private transport, typically cars; (2)
nonmotorized transport, including nonemission modes of transport such as bicycles,
rickshaws, and walking; (3) formal public transport, which encompasses services
available to the public that run on pre-set routes and timetables with set fares, and
that include buses, tramways, metros, suburban rail, and waterborne transport
(ferries, boats); and (4) informal (motorized) transport, including privately owned
vehicles whose operators often lack necessary permits or do not meet requirements
for vehicle size, insurance coverage, or driver standards.
The current level of motorized private transport use is not sustainable because it
generates pollution and congestion and hinders human and economic development
in cities. In particular, in LAC vehicle ownership has increased hugely as a
consequence of economic growth and social progress. The average number of motor
vehicles per capita in 1990 was 0.09; by 2008, it had risen to 0.20, which increased
trafﬁc and slowed down commuting speeds (Freeman et al. 2013).
The approach to transport has traditionally been focused on mobility. To attain a
sustainable transport system there should be a paradigm shift to favor access rather
than mobility, focus on efﬁcient and ﬂuent modes of transport, and promote lowcarbon and clean vehicles and fuels (Hidalgo and Huizenga 2013). This paradigm
involves three types of actions: avoiding long and unnecessary motorized travel,
shifting the movement of goods and people to the most efﬁcient modes of transport,
and improving the technology and operational management of transport services
(Dalkmann and Brannigan 2007).
Following the framework in Sect. 3 we can see that intervention in the transport
system is needed to internalize the social cost of congestion in the private cost of
transport considered in the model. Some governments have either implemented
travel demand management policies or have considered ways of directly reducing
the number of vehicles in congested areas.
To date, travel demand management measures in LAC have been mainly
vehicular restrictions and the promotion of public transport modes. The types of
administrative restrictions applied have consisted mostly of monitoring license plate
numbers. These experiences have proven unsustainable in the medium and long
term or have had negative effects (Ide Carvallo and Lizana 2011). Examples of such
and increased the hours worked by the huge taxi ﬂeet to replace car trips (Davis
2007); the No Car Day (Dia sin Carro) in Bogota, which has resulted in a signiﬁcant
´
social loss for car users (Cantillo and Ortuzar 2011) and has not reduced pollution
given the poor quality of public transport (Ide Carvallo and Lizana 2011); the
Vehicle Restriction (Restriccion Vehicular) Program in Santiago, which reduced
trafﬁc by one-ﬁfth of the expected effect (De Grange and Troncoso 2010); and the
˜
Estadual Rodizio Program in Sao Paulo, which increased the car ﬂeet (Biezus and
Oliveira Rocha 1999). The Vehicle Restriction (Restriccion Vehicular) Program in
San Jose, Costa Rica and the Peak and Plate (Pico y Placa) Program in Medellin are
similar examples that have not been successful (Ide Carvallo and Lizana 2011). Pico
y Pala in Quito has had mixed results.16
On the other hand, examples of travel demand management policies in developed
cities can be found, for example, in Singapore (vehicle registration caps and
dynamic congestion pricing), London (congestion pricing), Milan (air pollution
pricing), and San Francisco (parking controls with dynamic pricing). While in LAC
travel demand management policies have mainly involved road rationing through
‘‘command-and-control,’’ in the developed world incentive-based policies are more
common.
Congestion pricing is a very popular travel demand management measure that
encompasses a set of strategies and techniques aimed at imposing charges that
effectively discourage motorists from entering a congested area during certain
periods of high trafﬁc congestion (Hau 1992; Vickrey 1969). The concept behind
congestion pricing is to charge those using private cars with the negative externality
they produce by slowing down the trafﬁc and producing more pollution. It is
assumed that people would make socially efﬁcient decisions if they fully consider
the social costs and beneﬁts. The optimal congestion tax is the marginal external
cost at the point where the marginal social cost is equal to the marginal social
beneﬁt (Button 1993). In practice, an analysis of pricing schemes ensures that
congestion taxes are appropriately set.
Multiple forms of congestion pricing have been implemented, including schemes
covering the inner city (as in London), a signiﬁcant part of the metropolitan area (as
in Singapore), or a wider perimeter area (as in Oslo). These strategies have been
effective in reducing congestion and pollution. For example, the congestion charge
in London reduced the number of private cars, vans, and trucks coming into central
London between 2002 (year of introduction) and 2003 by 27 %. There was a drop
by 33 % in inbound car trafﬁc (65,000–70,000 trips that are no longer made),17 a
decrease in trafﬁc congestion, and an increase in the mean speed in the inner city
(Leape 2006). It is important to highlight that in London there are very fast and
accessible alternatives to private cars, such as the metro (tube) or a wide coverage of
buses.
16

See Carrillo et al. (2014) for positive ﬁndings about Pico y Pala; see also Ide Carvallo and Lizana
(2011).
17
In 2003, London imposed a daily charge for driving or parking a vehicle on public roads within central
London. Today the congestion charge is £10 daily between 7:00 a.m. and 6:00 p.m. on weekdays to enter
successful in reducing congestion and pollution, there are barriers that currently
prevent it from being widely adopted in LAC. These include implementation of a
sophisticated tracking system to enforce it and the development of efﬁcient
alternatives to private motorized transport (Rogat et al. 2009).
In the past decade, the development of sustainable transportation programs based
on public transport has become popular in LAC. There are no rigorous studies, but
the descriptive evidence shows that such programs have had positive results in
reducing pollution and trafﬁc in some Latin American cities, such as Bogota,
Mexico City, and Santiago. Among these programs, the two main types are
initiatives for mass transit using rapid transit bus systems and the use of bikes. For
example, Brazil and Colombia implemented major transport policies based on
cycling promotion that integrated cycling lanes into the public transport network
(Bicycle Brazil, and Ciclorutas in Colombia), and rapid bus transport. Chile has
focused on improvements of public transport with rapid bus transport within the
Transantiago Plan.
Countries included in the Sustainable Transport Forum (Foro de Transporte
Sostenible—FTS) survey carried out by the United Nations Centre for Regional
Development and the Inter-American Development Bank reported 42 cities with
mass transit (rail and rapid bus transport) and 327 cities with bike lanes (85 % in
Brazil) (UNCRD-IDB 2011). In terms of total kilometers, the largest mass transit
availability is in Brazil, with 829 km of suburban railway, 278 km of metro, and
80 km of rapid bus transport in 16 cities. Argentina has the largest suburban rail
network (830 km). The largest extension of rapid bus transport corridors is in
Colombia (386 km in six cities). Availability of mass transit ranges between 2.2 and
41.6 km per million urban inhabitants (Peru and Chile, respectively) to no mass
transit. Availability of bike lanes ranges from 2 to 15 km per million urban
inhabitants (Mexico and Brazil, respectively). While the length of metro and
suburban rail systems has not grown substantially in the past decade in LAC, both
rapid bus transport and bike lanes have grown explosively.
Bocarejo and Oviedo (2013) analyze the rapid bus transport network,
Transmilenio, in Bogota. While urban sprawl has been the general growth pattern
in most developing cities worldwide, Bogota has undergone a process of
densiﬁcation in speciﬁc areas in the past decade. Using a differences-in-differences
methodology, Bocarejo and Oviedo (2013) show that the Transmilenio, built during
that period, is one of the variables that account for this higher density. Areas served
by Transmilenio, especially those in the periphery that have been provided with
feeder bus routes, have higher growth than zones without access to this system.
There are descriptive studies on other rapid bus transport systems in LAC that
have had mixed results. The evaluation of Metrobus in Mexico City by Global Mass
Transit Research (2009) showed that the operation of Lines 1 and 2 of the Metrobus
has produced an important decrease in pollution (less emissions). In addition, both
lines have brought commuter time savings of 30 %. On the other hand, reports on
Metrobus-Q in Quito and Transmilenio in Santiago show mixed results (Ide
Geographical segregation is a major problem affecting the income opportunities of
slum dwellers. Slums are usually ‘‘bad’’ neighborhoods with deﬁcient services
(urban infrastructure, health, education, etc.), social and economic violence, and
limited working opportunities. Usually the jobs available are unstable, informal, and
have low productivity. Wealthier neighborhoods of the city, on the other hand, have
more economic opportunities but are hard to reach for some low-income
households. Sometimes the transport links are deﬁcient or nonexistent; other times
the slums are located in areas far from the city center. The social stigma of slum
dwellers because they live in deﬁcient housing is also a factor reducing their
possibilities in the city. Geographical segregation is just one aspect of social (and, in
some countries, racial) segregation endured by slum dwellers. For example, Perlman
(2003) provides evidence from slums in Rio de Janeiro suggesting that the stigma of
having a residential address in a squatter settlement has adverse consequences on
the probability of getting a job.
Public transit has a key role in socially and physically integrating the urban poor
into the formal city. Mobility is one of the main factors that reduce social exclusion
(Vella-Brodrick et al. 2011). In recent years large infrastructure projects have been
undertaken in LAC cities to reduce the immense divide between prosperous areas
and slums. An example is the inauguration in December 2011 of the giant outdoor
escalator to Medellin’s slum, Comuna 13. The 1260-foot escalator, built at a cost of
US$6.7 million, has shortened the 35-min hike on foot up the hillside to get to
Comuna 13 to a 6-min ride. The Metrocable in Medellin and the Transmilenio in
Bogota are aimed at similar purposes. In Rio de Janeiro, a six-station cable car line
inaugurated in 2011 runs above a collection of favelas known as the Complexo do
Alemao and carries an estimated 30,000 people a day along a 2.1-mile route. This
US$74 million urban gondola line has transformed what used to be an hour-and-ahalf journey into a 16-min sky ride. The extent to which geographical segregation
was alleviated by these innovations, and their effect on housing and other
socioeconomic outcomes has yet to be studied.
Apart from these large infrastructure projects, other reforms in public transit can
shape the spatial patterns of a city and the housing choices of the urban poor. First,
the trend to demotorize large cities can help the poor if it increases cycling and
walking space in city centers and promotes affordable public means of transport
(such as rapid bus transport). To integrate the poor via transport, a very careful
diagnostic study should ﬁrst be performed to assess whether the current transport
network is in fact inaccessible (does not reach poor areas) or unaffordable.
As shown in Sect. 2, public transport in LAC is relatively more expensive than in
the developed world in terms of its proportion of the minimum wage. In many
African cities, commuting by public transit costs between 26 and 50 % of the poor
household’s income (Cervero 2011). In the United States, Roberto (2008), using
data from 2000, found that the 10 % poorest spent twice as much share of their
income on commuting to work than the 10 % richest (6.1 versus 3.8 %).
The relevant question is which share of income is reasonable to be spent in
annual income should be spent on transport. Transport fares worldwide are
subsidized, but for the poor the burden is still too high. Targeted subsidies seem to
be an appropriate policy to reach the right groups and increase access to jobs. For
example, South Africa uses highly subsidized weekly coupons—each for 10
journeys between black townships and industrial development areas—to connect
low-income groups to jobs. Brazil requires formal sector employers to provide
transit tickets to employees through a system called Vale Transporte (VT). Firms
then deduct the VT expenditures from taxable income. The VT system effectively
spreads the cost of transport subsidies between employers and the government,
though it only affects those employed in the formal sector.
Mass transport (rapid bus transport, rails, subways, trams), when adequately
planned and implemented, has the potential to alleviate congestion and pollution,
and can particularly beneﬁt the poor, who rely most on these means of transport to
commute to work. Accessible and affordable transport can have a wide range of
positive effects. For example, Stanley et al. (2011) show that mobility improves
well-being. The effects of such transport on the consumption of housing services
and access to the labor market are of particular interest, but those effects have not
been widely studied. The effect of public transport expansion on employment has
been studied in the United States, with evidence showing that improving access to
jobs reduces the probability of asking for public assistance and increases the
likelihood of getting a paid job for unemployed adults and welfare recipients
(Sandoval et al. 2010). Kawabata (2003) shows a positive effect of access to
transport on being employed among low-skilled workers in San Francisco. In sum,
mass public transit is key to shaping the spatial sorting of citizens, and has the
potential to improve housing and labor market outcomes. Therefore it should
certainly be promoted in LAC.
4.2.3 Transport infrastructure
The improvement of transport infrastructure, such as repairs of roads and highways,
is a common supply-side policy to upgrade the transport system. In an urban
context, street paving has multiple functions: it facilitates vehicle, pedestrian, and
cyclist movement and access, provides accessible space for vehicle parking, allows
commercial vehicles to deliver goods, and has a signiﬁcant impact on the visual
appearance of the area. However, it can also lead to congestion.
Gonzalez-Navarro and Quintana-Domeque (2010) studied a randomized ﬁeld
experiment in Acayucan, Mexico, in which the city expanded its pavement grid over
time via street asphalting projects. Given that the municipal administration could
afford to pay for only 28 of the 56 projects in 2006, it was agreed to select the 28
streets to be paved at random. The follow-up was conducted almost a year after the
intervention and focused on households that were present both before and after the
intervention. They found that street paving led to a doubling in the average number
of home improvements in which a household engaged over the previous 6 months
(from 0.4 to 0.8 improvements). Furthermore, there was a 50 % increase in the
vehicles acquired. The rise in motor vehicle acquisition can also be explained by
complementarities with street paving. However, street paving has no statistically
signiﬁcant effect on monthly per capita expenditure (nondurable consumption).
Street paving increased home prices, though these estimates do not adjust for the
improvements in the house driven by the intervention itself. Street paving also
increased the percentage of individuals who used collateral-based credit from about
2 % among the control group to nearly 5 % among the treated group.
4.3 Housing infrastructure
In light of the growth perspectives of LAC cities, promoting access to the formal
housing market and improving mass public transit for the poor could eventually
prevent the formation of new slums and perhaps help reduce the size of existing
ones. However, some slums may persist if the poor prefer locations that are closer to
the city center.18 Also, slums may continue to grow because poverty traps impede
migrants from moving to a better location, despite the intention of the poor when
they move to the city to live in a slum only temporarily (Marx et al. 2013).
Following the framework of Sect. 3, families moving to the city that choose to
live close to the central business district will have a level of housing services below
qs. An important part of the compound variable q is housing infrastructure. The
urban poor live in housing with inadequate services, which poses a risk to their
health, security, and socioeconomic development. Low living standards pose
hazards to development.
To start with, adequate housing protects households from the negative effects of
the environment: proper roofs and walls shelter household members from rain and
cold (Galiani et al. 2013). Safe water and sanitation facilities, as well as nondirt
ﬂoors, are important to protect dwellers against parasitic infestations and infections.
Deﬁcient facilities contribute to acute respiratory diseases and diarrhea, among
other infectious waterborne diseases (e.g., tuberculosis, hepatitis, dengue, pneumonia, cholera, and malaria) (Luby et al. 2004). In addition to these health issues,
overcrowding increases the possibility that contagious diseases will spread within
the household when one member falls ill.
Children are the most affected by inadequate housing facilities. Galiani et al.
(2005), for example, show that safe water reduces child mortality. The damage from
childhood diseases and malnutrition can be irreversible. Children often miss school
due to illness, and anemia can make them permanently lag behind in their cognitive
development (Cattaneo et al. 2009). Adequate housing also provides security
against crime, a major problem in slum areas. Proper housing can enable families to
accumulate assets and free up their time from protecting assets in order to engage in
more productive activities (Field 2007).
For all these reasons, adequate housing is critical for health, child development,
and household productivity, which in turn contribute to a better quality of life.
Moreover, proper housing can induce a sense of dignity. Thus, housing quality has a
18

of happiness with all aspects of life. It is natural that the houses and neighborhoods
where people live are major factors inﬂuencing their life satisfaction. Surveys and
studies reveal that in LAC, people’s satisfaction with the homes and cities where
they live is a main determinant of their overall life satisfaction (Lora et al. 2010).
Several approaches have been tried to address the problem of slums. The ﬁrst has
been the ‘‘eradication’’ strategy, which has proven expensive (assuming governments can provide homes for the displaced population) and socially disruptive.
Then, in the 1970s a popular approach was ‘‘site-and-services,’’ which provided
urbanized lots for families to build their homes progressively away from slum areas.
This approach has also been criticized for being incomplete and leaving families
worse off as they lost their social capital, than they were when they lived in the
original slum area. Since the 1980s, local and central governments have increasingly
undertaken in situ slum upgrading based on the notion that it is both socially and
economically more desirable. In situ upgrading and improvement programs have the
goal of integrating low-income communities into the formal city and the housing
market. The main advantage of in situ slum upgrading is that it maintains the social
networks of the dwellers and the cohesiveness of the community because residents
remain in the same location, but under better living conditions (Abdenur 2009). This
approach has led to the implementation of a variety of programs, from those that
deal with land tenure to fully integrated programs.19 The next section analyzes
different types of programs to improve the housing services of the urban poor.
4.3.1 In situ housing infrastructure upgrading
To improve the living standards of the poor, there is consensus that upgrading
infrastructure for water, sanitation, and hygiene should be the priority because of the
health issues involved, especially for children. Diarrhea is closely related to poor
living conditions and is estimated to be the cause of 21 % of deaths of children
under 5 years of age in developing countries, accounting for 2.5 million deaths per
year (Kosek et al. 2003). Unsafe water supply and the lack of proper sanitation
facilities, together with poor hygiene practices, cause approximately 88 % of all
diarrhea infections worldwide (Evans 2005). This problem is more severe in slums,
as they are densely populated environments in which where infections propagate
easily.
Galiani et al. (2005) found that improving the quality of water through the
privatization of water supply decreased child mortality in Argentina. Also, the
promotion of safe hygiene practices and improved sanitation are effective in
improving child health (Luby et al. 2004; Hutton and Haller 2004). Luby et al.
(2006) found positive results for reducing diarrhea from the effects of combining
drinking water treatment and hand washing for prevention.
Access to infrastructure is usually a principal component of comprehensive slum
upgrading programs. Making infrastructure work for the poor requires promoting
access and ensuring that consumption is affordable. Better access can involve
19

requiring operators to promote access. Affordability can involve reducing actual
bills and service costs and facilitating easier payments. There is evidence of low
demand for some services due to a lack of information regarding the positive effects
of better facilities, or because the use of those services involves changes in habits
(Banerjee and Duﬂo 2011). In addition, the lack of formal land tenure is often cited
as a cause for not investing in housing upgrades, as untenured households fear
eviction (Galiani and Schargrodsky 2010). There is also a growing literature on the
willingness to pay for such services in Asia and Africa. Ashraf et al. (2010) and
Kremer et al. (2009) conducted randomized experiments in Zambia and Kenya,
respectively, and found low willingness—in terms of money spent on chlorine or
time spent on collecting water—to pay for improved water quality.
More studies are needed to increase access to better services and promote the
uptake of new technologies that can have positive direct effects on health. The
problem is complex because the provision of these services also involves collective
action problems, as there are usually positive or negative externalities of individual
take-up in the community that inﬂuence willingness to pay and other factors. For
example, to implement a program that extends sewage or water connections, a
minimum amount of households need to be willing to adopt the service. Duﬂo et al.
(2012) describe the barriers to adoption of water, sanitation, and hygiene
interventions, especially in Africa and Asia.
There are a set of papers that study the impact of housing improvements on a
wide range of outcomes and that exploit experimental or quasi-experimental. They
include Galiani et al. (2013) on the effect of prefabricated housing interventions,
Cattaneo et al. (2009) on the effect of replacing dirt ﬂoors with cement ﬂoors, and
Devoto et al. (2012) on the effects of piped water connection.
Galiani et al. (2013) assess the impact of providing better houses in situ to slum
dwellers in El Salvador, Mexico, and Uruguay. The authors experimentally
evaluated the impact of an initiative called A Roof for My Country (Un Techo Para
Mi Paıs—UTPMP), a youth-led program that provides basic prefabricated houses to
´
extremely poor populations in LAC. UTPMP budget and personnel constraints limit
the number of housing units that can be upgraded at any one time, so beneﬁciaries
are selected through a lottery system. Galiani et al. (2013) rely on a randomized
controlled experiment to evaluate the effect of upgrading houses in slums, thus
reporting internally valid. In addition, as the same experiment was replicated in
three different countries with very similar results, it can give us a hint of the external
validity of its estimates.
UTPMP houses are made of wood (Mexico and Uruguay) or aluminum (El
Salvador).20 A typical house is 18 meters squared and is built by teams of youth
volunteers working alongside the beneﬁciary household. UTPMP dwellings offer
signiﬁcant improvements for the poor population targeted in terms of ﬂooring, roof,
and walls, but it should be borne in mind that the homes do not come with water and

20

The UTPMP works in 18 Latin American countries. The evaluation performed by Galiani et al. (2013)
drinking water, or gas.
As expected, the program substantially improves the quality of ﬂoors, walls, and
roofs, as well as the share of rooms in the house with windows. Living in a better
house can on itself be a source of satisfaction, dignity, and pride, aside from other
dimensions such as health, education, or labor outcomes. Galiani et al. (2013) found
that families reported being signiﬁcantly happier with their houses and their lives.
The gains were substantially larger in El Salvador, where houses were in worse
conditions before the treatment, than in Uruguay and Mexico. However, the study
also found that families did not further improve their houses as a response to the
improvements made under the program. In particular, there were no signiﬁcant
effects on access to water, electricity, sanitation, or the possession of assets.
The estimates show that in El Salvador all self-reported measures of security
increased substantially—the increase in the index for security inside the house was
around 30 % and that for whether it is safe to leave children alone was about 90 %.
On the other hand, no effect was detected in Uruguay or Mexico. The authors did
not ﬁnd an effect of the program on victimization rates in any country.
Galiani et al. (2013) examined whether a better house could directly or indirectly
stimulate labor supply and earnings and did not detect signiﬁcant effects on any
labor market outcomes. They did ﬁnd positive effects on child health measured by
reduced diarrhea prevalence in El Salvador and Mexico. This could be due to having
a cleaner and better ventilated dwelling provided by the program.
In summary, it seems that better houses in situ for slum dwellers in El Salvador,
Mexico, and Uruguay improve satisfaction with the quality of life. Perceptions of
security changed for the better in El Salvador, and there seems to have been a
positive effect on child health in El Salvador and Mexico. However, the program
had no signiﬁcant effect either on the possession of assets or on labor outcomes.
Cattaneo et al. (2009) investigated the impact of a large-scale program, called
Solid Ground (Piso Firme), undertaken by the Mexican government to replace dirt
ﬂoors up to 50 m2 with cement ﬂoors. Dirt ﬂoors are a threat to health because they
provide a vector for parasites to infest people, especially young children, since fecal
matter tends to remain on the ﬂoor (difﬁcult to spot and clean). To identify the
effects of this intervention the authors took advantage of the geographic variability
in implementation of the program that started in 2000 some states were treated but
neighboring states were not. The treatment areas were high-density, low-income
urban neighborhoods, and eligible households had to have dirt ﬂoors and be able
prove home ownership prior to participating in the program. The households already
had water and sanitation facilities. The program covered the cost of the cement,
while households supplied the labor input needed to prepare and install the ﬂoor.
The study found that replacing dirt ﬂoors with cement ﬂoors interrupts the
transmission of parasitic infestations and reduces the incidence of both diarrhea and
anemia. Reduction in anemia is expected to have positive effects on cognitive
development. In fact, the study found that children in treated households performed
signiﬁcantly better on child development tests. However, an alternative pathway
could have been through the program’s effect on economic resources. Piso Firme
and invest in cement ﬂoors, it could have used the resources freed up by this in-kind
transfer to increase consumption or to make other kinds of investments, such as
additional housing investments that could affect health outcomes or in microenterprises that might increase household income. The authors rule out this channel, as
they show that the program is not associated with the value of houses (treatment
households did not consider their houses to be more valuable than control
households did), with changes in income, or with total consumption. Also, the
program did not have the effect of encouraging households to make additional
improvements to their houses.
A main result of the Piso Firme intervention, as described in Cattaneo et al.
(2009), is that following implementation of the program adults were substantially
happier, as measured by their degree of satisfaction with their housing and quality of
life, and had signiﬁcantly lower scores on depression and perceived stress. The
reasons adults were happier may have to do with the fact that they were living in a
better environment and their children were healthier. These results indicate that
housing has a signiﬁcant effect on welfare.
Devoto et al. (2012) studied the welfare effects of a program that increases access
to piped water in low-income households in Tangiers, Morocco. Many poor urban
households in Tangiers were located in neighborhoods connectable to the water
system, but could not afford the connection fee. These households had free access to
public taps installed in their neighborhood, and also had sanitation facilities at
home. The program provided a subsidized interest-free loan to install a water
connection. The loan was to be repaid in regular installments with the water bill
over 3 to 7 years. The loan did not cover the cost of installing the connection or the
cost of water consumed. To pilot-test the program, a door-to-door awareness
campaign was conducted in early 2008 among 434 households, randomly chosen
from the 845 that needed a connection.
The authors found with this randomized experiment that households are willing
to pay a substantial amount of money to gain access to a private tap at home. Within
a year, 69 % of households in the treatment group had purchased a connection
(against 10 % in the control group), and as a result their average monthly water bill
more than doubled from US$9 to US$24 a month (the previous cost came from
households that used water from their neighbors). The quality of water was
unchanged, since public taps are also maintained and the water comes from the
same source. The study found no change in the incidence of water-borne diseases,
such as child diarrhea. The connection generated important time gains, but it did not
lead to increases in labor market participation, income, or schooling attainment. The
extra time seems to have been used for leisure and socializing. The private
connection program did reduce the risk of conﬂict or ill-feelings between neighbors.
Overall, consistent with Cattaneo et al. (2009), Devoto et al. (2012) noted that that
households’ psychological well-being improves substantially when they upgrade
their housing facilities.
It is important to note that the intervention studied by Devoto et al. (2012)
provided a loan rather than an in-kind subsidy. Their conclusions are useful in terms
offered the loan. Thus, initiatives like that in Morocco, for which there is
willingness to pay, can involve relatively low costs for the state yet improve the
welfare of poor urban families through investments in better housing.
In summary, the ﬁndings of these papers, which have an internally valid design,
suggest that limited in situ improvements in housing are not sufﬁcient to bring about
signiﬁcant changes in living conditions of the urban poor. Providing better housing
and housing facilities improves slum dwellers’ well-being and satisfaction with life,
but does not reduce the various ailments they suffer as a result of living in slums.
What might be necessary, then, is to carry out broader slum upgrading programs that
combine housing improvements with broader interventions that address other major
problems affecting slum dwellers.
4.3.2 Integral urban upgrading
Among the several forms of urban development interventions, slum upgrading
offers an incomparable opportunity to affect many neighborhood outcomes that can
reshape the environment of a human settlement. Integral upgrading programs have
the ability to mobilize many different actors in diverse policy areas at various levels.
These programs can give momentum to the idea that improving a neighborhood
involves all dimensions of its life, including the freedom of citizens from or risk of
injury, public safety, welfare, satisfaction with life, education, employment, and
access to services, among others.
There is scant rigorous evidence on the effectiveness of such programs. There is
only one randomized evaluation by McIntosh et al. (2013), who studied a major
federal infrastructure spending program in poor neighborhoods in Mexico from
2009 to 2011. The intervention analyzed is a phase of the Habitat program of the
´
Social Development Secretariat (SEDESOL). The program, which has made US$68
million in infrastructure investments, targets the urban poor and focuses on
neighborhood upgrading through urban infrastructure (roads, water, sewerage,
lighting, and sidewalks) as well as community centers, parks, sports facilities, and
skill upgrading such as job training for the unemployed and health and nutrition
training for young mothers.
SEDESOL’s Habitat Program randomly selects a ‘‘polygon’’ (a speciﬁc
´
neighborhood) within each participating municipality for the upgrading program.
In order to be eligible for the program, a polygon needs to have a state and
municipal government willing to cooperate with the program’s cost-sharing rules,
which require local government to provide 50 % of project costs. In the projects
studied, the municipalities provided 40 % of those costs, the states provided 8 %,
and the beneﬁciaries provided 2 %. Also, according to the study, to be eligible the
populations in those polygons needed to be settled in marginalized urban areas with
concentrations of asset poverty greater than 50 %, located in cities of 15,000
inhabitants or more, with a deﬁcit of infrastructure and urban services, and with at
least 80 % of the lots having no active conﬂict over property rights.
McIntosh et al. (2013) studied the effect of the program across a wide range of
spending and little evidence of strong spillover effects of the program. They also
analyzed the effect of the program and found that some infrastructure variables
improved, satisfaction with neighborhood infrastructure did not change signiﬁcantly, private investment in housing stock improved, and the value of a square
meter of land in treatment neighborhoods increased by more than US$2 for every
US$1 invested by the program. The study is signiﬁcant because it is the ﬁrst to
evaluate a randomized integral program, but the authors did not conduct an in-depth
analysis to determine which components of the program are driving the effects.
There is also descriptive evidence of integral slum upgrading programs by UNHabitat under the Safer Cities Program. These integral interventions focus on
reducing crime through integral slum upgrading. They are an example of crime
prevention through environmental design, which is a policy that tries to reshape the
geographical space to reduce crime and enhance socioeconomic development. The
fundamental concept is that the physical environment affects criminal behavior and
can be changed in a way that will reduce the incidence and fear of crime (Cooke
2003).
UN-Habitat considers four key factors in these programs: the degree of social
cohesion, the extent of urban inequalities, the risks of the built environment, and the
scope of inclusiveness in urban governance. The factors are derived from six case
studies from UN-Habitat’s Safer Cities Program in Dhaka, Bangladesh, Doula,
Cameroon, Medellin, Colombia, Nairobi, Kenya, Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea,
and Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The evaluations of these programs were not performed
employing experimental or quasi-experimental designs that allow for attribution of
causality to the program for the changes observed in outcomes. The methods used
were analysis of the project and national documents, together with ﬁeld visits,
interviews, and focus groups with community leaders. This qualitative evaluation is
also a valuable source of information about associations between variables.
However, a lack of counterfactuals implies that there is no benchmark against which
to compare the progress of the variables. For example, it might have been the case
that there was also some positive evolution in outcomes of untreated slums due to
the favorable economic situation.
One of the case studies reviewed in UN-Habitat (2011) within the Safer Cities
Program was of the Integral Urban Program (Programa Urbano Integral—PUI),
which was implemented by the city of Medellin starting in 2002. Two components
were at the core of the PUI: ﬁrst, the promotion of public spaces for citizens of all
economic and social levels to enjoy; and second, the promotion of public education
and culture, conceived as tools for the development of the city and society, and key
elements for inclusion and equity. The PUI was implemented in areas of the city
with low human development indexes and accentuated problems of violence and
social conﬂicts.
The most salient effects of the PUI, according to the descriptive evidence
available, were economic and social (UN-Habitat 2011). First, the integral plan
promoted economic activity in the beneﬁciary area. At the individual level, the PUI
had positive effects on employment and income, since 92 % of the workforce
activities also rose dramatically in the area: there was a 300 % increase in trade, and
with the creation of a commercial boulevard the number of businesses along the
boulevard increased from 18 to 239. The relatively high investment in social and
cultural programs was four times more than expenditure on construction of the
Metrocable (the city’s main investment in physical infrastructure). Finally, social
outcomes also improved, according to the qualitative review of the PUI. Surveys
showed a signiﬁcant reduction in rates of violence and insecurity, mainly in intrafamiliar violence and burglary. There was also evidence of new community
leadership, strengthening of social and community organizations, and increasing
levels of citizen participation.
Another important intervention in the region is the Favela-Bairro Program in
Rio, Brazil. This program started in 1994 and is now in its third phase. The ﬁrst
phase focused on urban upgrading programs implemented in 38 favelas and on
improvements in other informal settlements. The second phase began in 2000 and
introduced activities in education, health and training, community development, and
property rights recognition. The third phase, which is ongoing, is designed to help
communities with between 500 and 2500 households. The objective is to improve
the living conditions of the urban poor through a comprehensive package of
interventions including social infrastructure, land tenure, and social development.
The program also includes speciﬁc objectives such as reducing the risk of geological
and environmental accidents (mostly landslides and ﬂoods), increasing transit
access, reducing the incidence of vector-borne disease, and increasing use of public
services. The basic infrastructure component includes installing water supply
facilities, gutters, sewerage, and lighting, as well as making road and garbage
collection improvements. The social component includes construction of early child
care centers, community activity programs, and training community development
workers. The social components were mainly available in the second phase, except
for the training program. Land titling interventions, though initially planned for the
ﬁrst phase, started to be implemented in the second phase. The completion rate of
the program has been high: 284 public works and other projects were executed,
accounting for over 90 % or the programmed activities. In all, interventions were
carried out in 38 of the 54 targeted favelas.
Soares and Soares (2005) performed an ex-post evaluation of the Brazil project
employing quasi-experimental design, and re-creating a matched control group from
different sources of information to circumvent the problems of not having a baseline
pre-intervention survey. The authors report positive results of the program,
especially related to an increase in the coverage of water and garbage collection
in favelas that outpaced the comparison groups identiﬁed. The impact on sewerage
was the most signiﬁcant at the aggregate level, and an analysis by income quartile
revealed that the poorest quartiles beneﬁted more from sewerage interventions than
the richest quartiles. This heterogeneous impact was also seen with respect to water,
garbage collection, and illiteracy. The authors did not ﬁnd signiﬁcant effects on
reducing mortality due to poor sanitation conditions or homicides. Neither were any
effects on housing values detected, although that could be due to data and
planned evaluation with the timely data collection processes be performed on future
phases of the program in order to better assess its effects. More studies are needed to
assess the beneﬁts of integral upgrading programs in general and to understand
which interventions should be included in them.

5 Conclusions
The countries of Latin America and the Caribbean have strikingly high urbanization
rates in comparison with other developing regions and even with many OECD
countries. In 2010, 79 % of the LAC population was living in cities and by 2050 it is
expected that 90 % of the population will be urban. As a consequence of this
process of massive urbanization, many citizens live in informal neighborhoods with
substandard housing and urban services, as cities have not been able to meet the
needs of their fast-growing populations. More than 100 million people live in slums,
in informal settlements with unsecure tenure, and/or in dwellings with deﬁcient
urban services.
According to Bouillon (2012), closing the current housing gap in LAC will
require an investment of at least US$310 billion, or 7.8 % of the region’s GDP. At
the moment LAC devotes 1 % of GDP, on average, to public programs for housing
and urban development issues (Bouillon 2012). Meeting future housing demands
will require a coordinated effort by all stakeholders—slum dwellers, local
governments, and ﬁnancial institutions—along with massive annual investments
estimated at US$70 billion.
To guide these investments and design the associated programs targeted at
improving living standards, it is important to understand the incentives that drive
housing choices of new city migrants. Toward this end, this chapter has presented a
theoretical model that provides a key insight: city migrants face a trade-off between
the affordability of services and transport costs. Using this trade-off as a starting
point, the chapter analyzed three types of urban policies: access to housing,
transport policies, and slum upgrading.
Urbanization in the region will continue, thus ﬁlling the knowledge gap on the
best way to integrate transit and land use to develop more sustainable and accessible
urban spaces. When transit and land development are integrated, there is less
dependence on private motorization, which in turn has positive effects on equity,
congestion, and the environment (Cervero 1998). To the best of our knowledge,
however, there is scant rigorous evidence on which to base policies to support this
process. To reverse the cycle of urbanization of poverty, more research is needed on
how to prevent the formation of slums by way of formal access to housing
coordinated with public transit policies.
Regarding access to housing, a popular policy in LAC has been land titling to
formalize those living in informal settlements. There is a good body of literature
with sound identiﬁcation strategies studying such programs. Land titling has
positive effects on housing investments, negative effects on household size (less
There is weak support for the hypothesis that land titling can have positive effects
on capital investment because the dwelling can be used as collateral. One reason
may be because the access of slum dwellers to the credit market is very limited.
Also, the high legal costs associated with eviction and with obtaining a mortgage
execution might preclude mortgage credit (Galiani and Schargrodsky 2011). It is
important to assess the long-term effects of land titling to ensure that regulatory
policies enable its sustainability. It is still not clear how to incorporate the
regularized properties into formal renting and housing markets. Finally, more
research is needed on the best type of titling, registration or recording, both of which
seem to be efﬁcient options in the developed world.
The housing affordability gap in LAC is mainly driven by the low income of poor
households. Supply- and demand-side polices to close this gap have not been
thoroughly studied. There are still open questions as to the best types of subsidies or
ﬁnancial instruments to enhance home ownership among the poor and how to
promote the rental market for this segment. Policies that involve private–public
partnerships to increase the supply of affordable units are very important to expand
the supply of housing for low-income citizens. The policy response to housing
problems in LAC in terms of quality and affordability has, in most cases, ignored
rental housing as a vehicle to provide adequate housing solutions for low-income
families. The development of the rental market for low-income segments is an even
less explored area. Rigorous evaluations should be encouraged when new housing
programs are implemented to compare the cost-effectiveness of different options.
As explained in this paper, the process of rapid urbanization in LAC has resulted
in an increase in transportation demands. Better public transport links can alleviate
the housing gap because they enable the poor to move to the suburbs where land and
housing services are cheaper. Problems with road congestion and pollution are also
becoming severe in the bigger cities of LAC, where private motorization has
increased exponentially. However, to date, transport in general, and public transit
for the poor in particular, has been an understudied topic. One reason might be
because enhancing mobility has not been stated as an explicit priority in the United
Nation’s Millennium Development Goals. Another reason is the lack of systematic
statistics. Travel surveys like the ones performed in more advanced countries can be
a starting point to identify the constraints faced by low-income commuters
(affordability, accessibility, etc.).
A wide range of travel demand management policies have been applied in
different countries, ranging from vehicular restrictions to public transport
improvements, but there remains a gap in the knowledge of what works in travel
demand management in the region. Anecdotal data and descriptive statistics show
that sustainable transport reforms based on rapid bus transport have been successful
in better connecting cities and reducing pollution. The promotion of cycling through
the expansion of cycling lanes and bike-sharing facilities is becoming more
common in the region, though the take-up of such programs is still limited (IDB
2013) and there are no evaluations of their effect so far. Nor is there any
experimental design to assess the effect of different alternatives to make public
Vale Transporte program in Brazil).
Expanding public transit can have an important effect on sorting income groups
in cities and has the potential to encourage the decentralization of the urban poor
from inner-city slums and improve access to the labor market of the urban poor in
the suburbs. LAC scores low in mobility indexes, and thus a serious assessment of
transport demand to reshape cities is a very important avenue for future research.
Slums can be viewed as the ﬁrst location of rural migrants when they arrive in a
city, the place from which they explore labor opportunities. This often means being
close to the city center and living in deﬁcient housing. The problem is that in LAC
many slums have turned into a permanent and burgeoning phenomenon due to
poverty traps. In light of anticipated future urbanization, as mentioned earlier, the
integration of formal housing supply and transport systems is key to meet the
demands of new low-income migrants. Even so, slum dwellers in some cases may
choose to stay in the slums given their strong preference for the location or because
of social and economic bonds.
This paper has also examined policies to upgrade the living standards of slum
dwellers. What seems not to work is relocating entire slum areas to remote locations
or providing social housing far from the original marginal neighborhoods. Evidence
from a randomized experiment in the United States (the Moving to Opportunity
Program) and from quasi-experiments in Chile and Mexico suggests that the
beneﬁts of better housing services under such initiatives are outweighed by social
disintegration, stigmatization, and loss of work opportunities because beneﬁciaries
cannot get to their existing workplaces and have difﬁculties ﬁnding new jobs closer
to their new location. In situ upgrading, when possible, is a better option than
relocation. This is consistent with the evidence presented in Baker et al. (2005) for
Mumbai. That study used a residential location model to assess the welfare of both
an in situ slum upgrading program and a relocation program. It concluded that for
households relocated further away, the increased commuting distances wiped out
the housing beneﬁts of the program and that beneﬁciaries were better off with the
more limited housing improvement provided by the in situ intervention.
There is also already a body of knowledge on the effects of in situ housing
infrastructure upgrades. Providing better housing and housing services improves
slum dwellers’ well-being and satisfaction with life. Some interventions, like
improved water quality and improved ﬂooring or walls, have positive effects on
child health. Upgrading the walls and roof of a home can also improve a
household’s perception of security. However, these limited in situ improvements in
housing are not sufﬁcient to achieve signiﬁcant changes in the living conditions of
the urban poor and to signiﬁcantly reduce the various ailments they suffer as slum
dwellers.
What might be necessary, then, is to carry out wider slum upgrading programs
that combine housing improvements with broader interventions addressing other
major problems affecting slum dwellers. There are few evaluations of slum
upgrading interventions that exploit experimental or quasi-experimental designs,
although randomized evaluations are feasible and can be implemented in many
programs.
Given the multiple challenges and the dimension of the problems in slum areas,
large-scale coordinated programs to reshape the overall environment would seem
better suited than small-scale interventions. Integral upgrading programs have the
ability to mobilize many different actors in diverse policy areas at various levels.
These programs can give momentum to the idea that improving a neighborhood
involves addressing all the dimensions of life there, including freedom from risk of
injury, public safety, welfare, satisfaction with life, education, employment, access
to services, and effective transport networks.
However, causal investigations have been carried out for most of the integral
programs undertaken in LAC. It is critical to incorporate evaluation of integral
programs into the region’s research agenda to assess the best set of interventions. To
date, little is known about complementarities and economies of scale in delivering
urbanization programs. For example, water and sanitation could be coupled with
community strengthening to enhance social cohesion, which in turn could have
positive effects on other individual as well as community outcomes. Also, transport
interventions together with housing upgrades could improve living conditions and
increase the disposable incomes of slum dwellers.
