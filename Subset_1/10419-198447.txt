Introduction
EU has not escaped the “overwhelming” process of globalization. It is vividly felt in almost all
branches of the economic, social and juridical spheres. Rapid developments are predicted in all areas
of human activities.
It’s a well-known fact, that the economy of a particular country as well as the law is not a static,
but a dynamic phenomenon. It is a vivid result of a historical evolution which did not happen on its
own, as if in a vacuum. Today’s globalizing processes stipulate the emergence of the institutions
which facilitate intensive financial transactions, profitable investments and increased flows of money.
The common law “trust” and its European “descendants” (German “Treuhand”, Italian “Fondo
patrimoniale”, French “Fiducie”, etc.) can be regarded among these institutions. The English “trust”
“is undoubtedly an extremely versatile instrument which is suitable for a great variety of purposes,
even leading some commentators to qualify it as a “universal fix-it” (Koessler, 2012, p. 13). Many
scholars believe, that the original form of this unique institution appeared in the common law of the
Middle Ages. In 1872 the trust law was adopted in the State of Connecticut, while the first trust
company was created in 1806 according to the recommendation of financier and politician A.
Hamilton. During the 19th century, the given legal institution became popular in the American
business sphere. It offered several economic and legal advantages, especially through mutual and
pension funds, while at the end of the 20 th century, the process of globalization stipulated the
“internationalization” of the trust mechanism. The starting point of this process was the conclusion
of the “Hague Convention on the Law Applicable to Trusts and on their Recognition” (1985) and its
ratification by 12 countries. Initially, the civil law jurisdictions were unable to adopt the “trust”
structure in which common-law power and equity power belonged to separate entities. Despite this
fact, in the recent years, “trust-like devices” have been introduced in certain economic-juridical
systems of Europe. Their rapid implementation raised the question of the establishment of innovative
policies for the management of the functioning of these newly-emerged constructions. This paper will
discuss the latest achievements and existing challenges on the example of German juridical-economic
system. Moreover, it will make proposals, which will be useful for a successful planning of the
European entrusting processes and terminological nomination of the concepts related to them.

1. German vis-à-vis English
It’s a well-known fact, that today’s Europe makes distinction between the civil and common
legal traditions. In our paper these traditions are presented by England (common law) and Germany
(civil law).
Many scholars believe that the greatest inconsistency between English and German
jurisdictions is presented in the area of “Property law”. The German legal system comprises an
absolute notion of ownership, which may be equalized with the Roman “dominium”. In the
German reality, “the owner of a corporeal object is the person who is in principle entitled to “deal
with the thing as he pleases and exclude others from any interference”. It belongs to him, and only
him” (Häcker, 2009, p. 36). In contrast to the German law, the English juridical system embraces
a non-absolute notion of ownership. “Firstly, English law adopts a system of relative titles as
opposed to absolute entitlements. Secondly, the recognition that equitable interests are in some
sense “proprietory” has led to the idea of ownership being “split” into bare legal title and an
equitable (or beneficial) interest” (Häcker, 2009, p. 35-36). This division has historical roots.
Moreover, it gave birth to the unique and remarkable common law institution named “trust”.

a) “the assets constitute a separate fund and are not a part of the trustee’s own estate;
b) title to the trust assets stands in the name of the trustee or in the name of another person on
behalf of the trustee;
c) the trustee has the power and the duty ... to manage, employ or dispose of the assets in
accordance with the terms of the trust and the special duties imposed upon him by law” 1.
It’s a well-known fact, that “German case law does not recognize the institution of the trust, as
the trust is incompatible with the dogmatic foundations of German law and does not resemble the
legal relationship of the Treuhand” (Sandor, 2014, p. 250). Moreover, “nowhere in German law can
one find any single institution which by itself performs all those functions for which the common
lawyer deploys the trust” (Kotz, 1999a, p. 85). However, the study of the contemporary German legal
system reveals the existence of several “trust-like devices”, which work differently, but perform
functions similar to the “trust”. B. Häcker directly indicates, that “in some situations a person holds
rights for the benefit of another, via a device described by the umbrella term Treuhand… A Treuhand
arises only in a limited number of particular instances (scattered throughout the BGB and developed
outside the statutory framework), each subject to its own specific rules and principles” (Häcker, 2009,
p. 39-40). Well-known German jurist Hein Kötz distinguishes three types of such institutions: “the
Testamentvollstreckung and Nacherbschaft, which are used to control succession to property for
several legatees (and typically for many years), the Stiftung which serves to collect and administer
funds for charitable purposes, and the general Treuhand by which an estate is administered for the
benefit of one or more persons” (Grundmann, 1998, p. 489). Stiftung, Testamentvollstreckung and
Nacherbschaft are often regarded as Quasitreuhands, while Treuhand is a prime example of
fiduciary arrangements of the German law.

1.1.Treuhand
The “Treuhand” is usually flexible and exempt from the state control. It considers the
transference of ownership based on “Vertrauen” (trust) and “Treue” (loyalty). It can be established
in three major ways: “through a full transfer of legal title (fiduziarische Vollrechtstreuhand), through
a transfer of legal title with conditions precedent (deutschrechtliche Treuhand), and with a mandate
granting dispositional rights (Ermächtigungstreuhand)” (Sandor, 2014, p. 253).

1 CONVENTION

ON THE LAW APPLICABLE TO TRUSTS AND ON THEIR RECOGNITION, available at:

Generally, the “Treuhand” “is created by a transfer of assets to the Treuhänder coupled with a
contractual agreement made between him and the transferor under which he assumes, normally in
consideration of a fee, a contractual duty to manage the assets in a particular way for the benefit of
the beneficiaries” (Kotz, 1999a, p. 89). In other words, “fiduziarische Treuhand” is a fiduciary
construction by which an individual transfers the full right in rem to the other individual. Therefore,
the entrusting relations consider the following major elements:
•

Treugeber (settlor/beneficiary) - an individual, which transfers the full right in rem to the
other individual, who is obliged to deal with the assets in the manner specified by the contract;

•

Treuhänder (trustee) – an individual, who is obliged to deal with the transferred assets in the
manner specified by the contract.
“The Treuhand can exist without any written underpinning document. It can be concluded

between any two persons capable of being party to a contract” (OECD, 2013, p. 39). Although in
most cases the “Treuhand” represents a two-party relationship, it can include third party
relationships. The “Treuhand” may take different forms: “hidden (verdeckte Treuhand) or disclosed
to third parties (offene Treuhand)” (OECD, 2013, p. 39-40).
It is also worth mentioning, that although the Treugeber transfers his juridical ownership to the
Treuhänder, he retains the economic ownership. Therefore, a trustee (Treuhänder) becomes a legal
owner, whose duties are called fiduciary duties: “The Treuhänder acquires a full and unrestricted title
to the Treuhand assets, whereas the beneficiaries’ interests are, at least in theory, merely the ordinary
rights in personam of parties to a contract” (Kotz, 1999a, p. 93). The Treuhänder can transfer the
legal title to a third person, while the Treugeber has only damages claims in those cases when the
transferor violates the obligations. It means that the “fiduziarische Treuhand” does not fully protect
the rights of the Treugeber. Therefore, the practical implementation of this construction seems quite
risky.
However, the German legal system gives the Treugeber an opportunity to make a safer
agreement (the so-called Ermächtigungstreuhand - trust by authorization), under which he (she)
does not transfer the full right in rem to the Treuhänder, but simply authorizes him (her) to manage
or dispose of the assets in a specific manner. When the trustee exceeds his authorization the disposal
of the assets is not valid … no real separation of property takes place and the protection of the settlor
is of minor importance because he is still the legal owner with all of his power” (Rehahn et al., 2012,

1.1.1.Stiftung
Stiftung is usually identified with a “charitable trust”. It belongs to the group of juristic entities
capable of owning property and of suing and being sued. If a person wants to dedicate assets to
charitable purposes or to devote patrimony to specific aims, he/she “must declare such an intention
in writing or by will (testamentary foundation), the Stiftungsgeschäft or endowment transaction”
(Rehahn et al., 2012, p. 102). The given transaction consists of two parties:


a founder (Stifter), which transfers a patrimony to a new legal entity and sets up rules of
administration;



a foundation (Stiftung) – a newly-created legal entity, which administers assets, but is
supervised by the Bundesland.

The “Stiftung” can be created only with the permission of the “Bundesland”, or the federal
state, where a newly-created legal entity will have its seat. It is worth mentioning that “apart from the
creation of a new legal entity, the trustor can also transfer the property to an already existing person
with the declaration that the transferee must separate these assets from his own property and has to
administer them on a continuing basis as the trustor has set it up” (Westebbe, 1993). Such type of a
transaction is nominated as “Stiftungstreuhand” or “unselbständige Stiftung”. The latter considers
the transference of a smaller amount of property. The founder “transfers assets as a gift inter vivos or
by will to another natural or juristic person – e.g. a university, a church, a museum, a charitable
association - on the understanding that the transferee keeps the assets transferred separate from his
own assets and that the gains made from the assets shall be used to further the charitable purpose
prescribed by the founder” (Kotz, 1999b, p. 52). It is worth mentioning that in the case of
“Stiftungstreuhand” or “unselbständige Stiftung” (foundation trust or dependent foundation), the
trustee’s creditors are not able to take legal actions in respect to the separated assets. These actions
can be impeded by a founder or by beneficiaries. This is a unique example of Sondervermögen
(separated patrimony). The existence of Sondervermögen emphasizes the fact, that German law
“accepts” the notion of “splitting-up” - owning of more than one patrimony by one person. Such
separation of assets is determined by the concept of patrimony rather than that of property, because
the German property law is not based on the distinction between legal property and equitable property.
The major reason for splitting is that “the separated patrimony serves specific functions such as
providing liable patrimony for specific creditors, a particular administration of that patrimony or the

Therefore, an in-depth study of Stiftung reveals its similarity to a “charitable trust”. However,
there are certain differences between these two institutions - the Stiftung (foundation) should be
registered, “the representatives of foundations do not act in their own name, and the founder may not
be exclusive manager (Vorstand) of the foundation. As an additional difference, the representatives
are also liable to third parties” (Selbig, 2006, p. 167). The establishment of Stiftung is quite
expensive. Therefore, a trustor can use a simpler and cheaper way. He/She may transfer “assets to
another on the understanding that the assets shall constitute a separate fund, shall not form part of the
transferee’s own estate and that the transferee shall have the power and the duty to manage the assets
for the charitable purpose specified by the transferor” (H. Kotz, 1999a, p. 88). This type of
relationship between parties can be analyzed as “fiduziarische Treuhand”, which has already been
discussed.

1.1.2. Contractual Trust Arrangements (CTAs)
German “trust-like devices” have gained the greatest importance in the sphere of the economy,
especially, through company law. Since the 90s of the 20 th century the so-called Contractual Trust
Arrangements (CTAs) have been increasingly utilized by different types of German companies.
These agreements enable each company “to improve its balance sheet ratios and creditworthiness in
accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), the United States Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles (US-GAAP) and German accounting rules pursuant to the German
Commercial Code by removing both the pension obligations towards its employees and the covering
assets from the balance sheet” (Rehahn et al., 2012, p. 103). Contractual Trust Arrangements are
focused on the following:


outsourcing obligations to a third person;



ensuring the settlement of employees’ pension claims;



protecting the covering assets against the access of the creditors in the event of the
insolvency of sponsoring undertaking.

The lack of a coherent trust concept in German law leads to difficulties during the fulfillment
of the last activity, because “in the event of the opening of insolvency proceedings regarding the
assets of the sponsoring undertaking, the trust agreement shall expire which would normally establish

p. 104). The given problem is usually solved by the creation of a second trust. This is the case of the
“doppelseitige Treuhand” (two-way trust).
In certain cases the members of personal companies or shareholders of public companies
transfer their rights of shareholders to a third party/a third person, who performs the functions of a
trustee. This trust solution “concerns a Kommanditgesellschaft, in which as a personally liable partner
a limited liability company participates with dozens, sometimes hundreds, of individual investors as
limited partners (Kommanditisten). Here, it would be impracticable to invite all those investors to
general meeting of the company so that each could separately exercise his rights as partner” (H. Kotz,
1999b, p. 56). Therefore, the best management option in such cases is the transference of the limited
partners’ interests to a single trustee, who is obliged to exercise them in the interest of investor partners. This mode of management is called “Gesellschaftsanteile” (administrative trust of company
shares).

1.1.3. Terminological Insights
An in-depth study of the contemporary German economic-juridical “trust-like devices” and
their English equivalents enables us to make some terminological insights. The major emphasis ought
to be put on the term “Treuhand”, because it is used “as a collective term in German legal literature
and legal practice, which summarizes many different legal relationships of property manageme nt”
(Sandor, 2014, p. 254).
The carried out terminological study vividly reveals that “Routledge German Dictionary of
Business, Commerce, and Finance” presents the following English equivalents of the German lexical
units related to the “Treuhand”:
“Treuhand – Trust;
Treuhänder – Trustee, fiduciary;
Treugeber – settlor, transferor, trustor (AmE)” (Routledge German Dictionary of Business,
Commerce, and Finance, 1997)
The same data is presented in H. Haschka and H. Schmatzer’s well-known work “Aspects of
U.S. business and law (An English-language survey with German-language comments)”. This book
directly indicates, that “the essential elements of a trust are:
-

A trustor or settler (Treugeber).

-

A beneficiary (Begünstigter).

-

-

A fund or corpus (zweckgebundere Vermögensmasse) the title to which passes to the trustee)”
(Haschka et al., 1990, p. 167).
Additionally, “Collins English-German Dictionary” presents the following German equivalents

of the common law term “trust”:


“(law, finance) Treuhand (schaft) f



(= property) Treuhandeigentum nt



(= charitable fund) Stiftung f“2.

The existence of all the above mentioned equivalents makes the essence of „Treuhand”obscure
and equalizes it with the Anglo-American “trust”. Some scholars have thoroughly discussed this
question, for instance, Sh. A. Stark directly indicated, that the term „Treuhand” had a purely German
origin: “the German word “treu” means true and implies faithful” (Stark Sh., 2009, p. 3). Despite this
explanation “the word Treuhand is not a clear term in German, it cannot be exclusively described as
a trust in English either. For this reason, it is best to continue using the German word Treuhand
because it has no equivalent in English” (Stark Sh., 2009, p. 3). J. Rehahn and A. Grimm share Stark’s
idea and state: “German law is neither able to produce exactly the same effects as a trust in common
law nor has it one specific concept that works as a trust… the German law does not know a
homogeneous concept of a trust…” (Rehahn et al., 2012, p. 94). According to J. Rehahn and A.
Grimm the term „Treuhand” must be translated as „German trust”. The scholars directly indicate,
that this will help with the “eradication” of any ambiguities during the process of translation. The
same English equivalent (German trust) of “Treuhand” is presented in the following passage of the
book “Property law and economics”: “Concerning the unitary ownership characteristic, society has
created different kinds of ownership, which can be seen as forms of divided ownership, as the
Treuhand (German trust) and fiducie-gestion (French trust)” (Bouckaert, 2010, p. 28). We believe,
that „German trust” is the best English translation of the term „Treuhand”. Moreover, it is
recommended to translate the “Treugeber” as the “German trustor/settlor” and to nominate the
“Treuhänder” as the “German trustee”.

Conclusions

Therefore, the juridical-economic study of the contemporary German reality vividly reveals
that it has no single institution which performs all the functions performed by the common law
“trust”. Even the “Treuhand” - a prime example of fiduciary arrangements - is irreconcilable with
the “trust”, namely, in the third party relationships. Some scholars directly indicate that German law
cannot cope with the doctrine of the “real subrogation”. This means that in those cases, when the
“Treuhänder” buys assets with the money supplied by the Treugeber “or with the proceeds of sales
of the original property, or obtains property it exchanges for the original property, it is not clear
whether the beneficiaries will be awarded a proprietary right in the substitute property and on this
basis take priority over the Treuhänder’s private creditors” (Kotz, 1999a, p. 95).
All the above mentioned directly indicates to the following prominent fact: the German court
has no general competence in exercising the supervisory and administrative functions needed to make
the “Treuhand” as effective as the “trust” in the issues of the management of property. Therefore,
the rules of the German law regulating the “fiduziarische Treuhand” need clarification and
improvement via defining the questions of third party relationships and “real subrogation”. Moreover,
significant changes must be made in the terminological sphere in order to reflect the difference
between the common law “trust” and German “Treuhand”. We believe that „German trust” is the
best English translation of the term „Treuhand”. Moreover, we recommend to translate “Treugeber”
as the “German trustor/settlor” and to nominate the “Treuhänder” as the “German trustee”.

Introduction
EU has not escaped the “overwhelming” process of globalization. It is vividly felt in almost all
branches of the economic, social and juridical spheres. Rapid developments are predicted in all areas
of human activities.
It’s a well-known fact, that the economy of a particular country as well as the law is not a static,
but a dynamic phenomenon. It is a vivid result of a historical evolution which did not happen on its
own, as if in a vacuum. Today’s globalizing processes stipulate the emergence of the institutions
which facilitate intensive financial transactions, profitable investments and increased flows of money.
The common law “trust” and its European “descendants” (German “Treuhand”, Italian “Fondo
patrimoniale”, French “Fiducie”, etc.) can be regarded among these institutions. The English “trust”
“is undoubtedly an extremely versatile instrument which is suitable for a great variety of purposes,
even leading some commentators to qualify it as a “universal fix-it” (Koessler, 2012, p. 13). Many
scholars believe, that the original form of this unique institution appeared in the common law of the
Middle Ages. In 1872 the trust law was adopted in the State of Connecticut, while the first trust
company was created in 1806 according to the recommendation of financier and politician A.
Hamilton. During the 19th century, the given legal institution became popular in the American
business sphere. It offered several economic and legal advantages, especially through mutual and
pension funds, while at the end of the 20 th century, the process of globalization stipulated the
“internationalization” of the trust mechanism. The starting point of this process was the conclusion
of the “Hague Convention on the Law Applicable to Trusts and on their Recognition” (1985) and its
ratification by 12 countries. Initially, the civil law jurisdictions were unable to adopt the “trust”
structure in which common-law power and equity power belonged to separate entities. Despite this
fact, in the recent years, “trust-like devices” have been introduced in certain economic-juridical
systems of Europe. Their rapid implementation raised the question of the establishment of innovative
policies for the management of the functioning of these newly-emerged constructions. This paper will
discuss the latest achievements and existing challenges on the example of German juridical-economic
system. Moreover, it will make proposals, which will be useful for a successful planning of the
European entrusting processes and terminological nomination of the concepts related to them.

1. German vis-à-vis English
It’s a well-known fact, that today’s Europe makes distinction between the civil and common
legal traditions. In our paper these traditions are presented by England (common law) and Germany
(civil law).
Many scholars believe that the greatest inconsistency between English and German
jurisdictions is presented in the area of “Property law”. The German legal system comprises an
absolute notion of ownership, which may be equalized with the Roman “dominium”. In the
German reality, “the owner of a corporeal object is the person who is in principle entitled to “deal
with the thing as he pleases and exclude others from any interference”. It belongs to him, and only
him” (Häcker, 2009, p. 36). In contrast to the German law, the English juridical system embraces
a non-absolute notion of ownership. “Firstly, English law adopts a system of relative titles as
opposed to absolute entitlements. Secondly, the recognition that equitable interests are in some
sense “proprietory” has led to the idea of ownership being “split” into bare legal title and an
equitable (or beneficial) interest” (Häcker, 2009, p. 35-36). This division has historical roots.
Moreover, it gave birth to the unique and remarkable common law institution named “trust”.

a) “the assets constitute a separate fund and are not a part of the trustee’s own estate;
b) title to the trust assets stands in the name of the trustee or in the name of another person on
behalf of the trustee;
c) the trustee has the power and the duty ... to manage, employ or dispose of the assets in
accordance with the terms of the trust and the special duties imposed upon him by law” 1.
It’s a well-known fact, that “German case law does not recognize the institution of the trust, as
the trust is incompatible with the dogmatic foundations of German law and does not resemble the
legal relationship of the Treuhand” (Sandor, 2014, p. 250). Moreover, “nowhere in German law can
one find any single institution which by itself performs all those functions for which the common
lawyer deploys the trust” (Kotz, 1999a, p. 85). However, the study of the contemporary German legal
system reveals the existence of several “trust-like devices”, which work differently, but perform
functions similar to the “trust”. B. Häcker directly indicates, that “in some situations a person holds
rights for the benefit of another, via a device described by the umbrella term Treuhand… A Treuhand
arises only in a limited number of particular instances (scattered throughout the BGB and developed
outside the statutory framework), each subject to its own specific rules and principles” (Häcker, 2009,
p. 39-40). Well-known German jurist Hein Kötz distinguishes three types of such institutions: “the
Testamentvollstreckung and Nacherbschaft, which are used to control succession to property for
several legatees (and typically for many years), the Stiftung which serves to collect and administer
funds for charitable purposes, and the general Treuhand by which an estate is administered for the
benefit of one or more persons” (Grundmann, 1998, p. 489). Stiftung, Testamentvollstreckung and
Nacherbschaft are often regarded as Quasitreuhands, while Treuhand is a prime example of
fiduciary arrangements of the German law.

1.1.Treuhand
The “Treuhand” is usually flexible and exempt from the state control. It considers the
transference of ownership based on “Vertrauen” (trust) and “Treue” (loyalty). It can be established
in three major ways: “through a full transfer of legal title (fiduziarische Vollrechtstreuhand), through
a transfer of legal title with conditions precedent (deutschrechtliche Treuhand), and with a mandate
granting dispositional rights (Ermächtigungstreuhand)” (Sandor, 2014, p. 253).

1 CONVENTION

ON THE LAW APPLICABLE TO TRUSTS AND ON THEIR RECOGNITION, available at:

Generally, the “Treuhand” “is created by a transfer of assets to the Treuhänder coupled with a
contractual agreement made between him and the transferor under which he assumes, normally in
consideration of a fee, a contractual duty to manage the assets in a particular way for the benefit of
the beneficiaries” (Kotz, 1999a, p. 89). In other words, “fiduziarische Treuhand” is a fiduciary
construction by which an individual transfers the full right in rem to the other individual. Therefore,
the entrusting relations consider the following major elements:
•

Treugeber (settlor/beneficiary) - an individual, which transfers the full right in rem to the
other individual, who is obliged to deal with the assets in the manner specified by the contract;

•

Treuhänder (trustee) – an individual, who is obliged to deal with the transferred assets in the
manner specified by the contract.
“The Treuhand can exist without any written underpinning document. It can be concluded

between any two persons capable of being party to a contract” (OECD, 2013, p. 39). Although in
most cases the “Treuhand” represents a two-party relationship, it can include third party
relationships. The “Treuhand” may take different forms: “hidden (verdeckte Treuhand) or disclosed
to third parties (offene Treuhand)” (OECD, 2013, p. 39-40).
It is also worth mentioning, that although the Treugeber transfers his juridical ownership to the
Treuhänder, he retains the economic ownership. Therefore, a trustee (Treuhänder) becomes a legal
owner, whose duties are called fiduciary duties: “The Treuhänder acquires a full and unrestricted title
to the Treuhand assets, whereas the beneficiaries’ interests are, at least in theory, merely the ordinary
rights in personam of parties to a contract” (Kotz, 1999a, p. 93). The Treuhänder can transfer the
legal title to a third person, while the Treugeber has only damages claims in those cases when the
transferor violates the obligations. It means that the “fiduziarische Treuhand” does not fully protect
the rights of the Treugeber. Therefore, the practical implementation of this construction seems quite
risky.
However, the German legal system gives the Treugeber an opportunity to make a safer
agreement (the so-called Ermächtigungstreuhand - trust by authorization), under which he (she)
does not transfer the full right in rem to the Treuhänder, but simply authorizes him (her) to manage
or dispose of the assets in a specific manner. When the trustee exceeds his authorization the disposal
of the assets is not valid … no real separation of property takes place and the protection of the settlor
is of minor importance because he is still the legal owner with all of his power” (Rehahn et al., 2012,

1.1.1.Stiftung
Stiftung is usually identified with a “charitable trust”. It belongs to the group of juristic entities
capable of owning property and of suing and being sued. If a person wants to dedicate assets to
charitable purposes or to devote patrimony to specific aims, he/she “must declare such an intention
in writing or by will (testamentary foundation), the Stiftungsgeschäft or endowment transaction”
(Rehahn et al., 2012, p. 102). The given transaction consists of two parties:


a founder (Stifter), which transfers a patrimony to a new legal entity and sets up rules of
administration;



a foundation (Stiftung) – a newly-created legal entity, which administers assets, but is
supervised by the Bundesland.

The “Stiftung” can be created only with the permission of the “Bundesland”, or the federal
state, where a newly-created legal entity will have its seat. It is worth mentioning that “apart from the
creation of a new legal entity, the trustor can also transfer the property to an already existing person
with the declaration that the transferee must separate these assets from his own property and has to
administer them on a continuing basis as the trustor has set it up” (Westebbe, 1993). Such type of a
transaction is nominated as “Stiftungstreuhand” or “unselbständige Stiftung”. The latter considers
the transference of a smaller amount of property. The founder “transfers assets as a gift inter vivos or
by will to another natural or juristic person – e.g. a university, a church, a museum, a charitable
association - on the understanding that the transferee keeps the assets transferred separate from his
own assets and that the gains made from the assets shall be used to further the charitable purpose
prescribed by the founder” (Kotz, 1999b, p. 52). It is worth mentioning that in the case of
“Stiftungstreuhand” or “unselbständige Stiftung” (foundation trust or dependent foundation), the
trustee’s creditors are not able to take legal actions in respect to the separated assets. These actions
can be impeded by a founder or by beneficiaries. This is a unique example of Sondervermögen
(separated patrimony). The existence of Sondervermögen emphasizes the fact, that German law
“accepts” the notion of “splitting-up” - owning of more than one patrimony by one person. Such
separation of assets is determined by the concept of patrimony rather than that of property, because
the German property law is not based on the distinction between legal property and equitable property.
The major reason for splitting is that “the separated patrimony serves specific functions such as
providing liable patrimony for specific creditors, a particular administration of that patrimony or the

Therefore, an in-depth study of Stiftung reveals its similarity to a “charitable trust”. However,
there are certain differences between these two institutions - the Stiftung (foundation) should be
registered, “the representatives of foundations do not act in their own name, and the founder may not
be exclusive manager (Vorstand) of the foundation. As an additional difference, the representatives
are also liable to third parties” (Selbig, 2006, p. 167). The establishment of Stiftung is quite
expensive. Therefore, a trustor can use a simpler and cheaper way. He/She may transfer “assets to
another on the understanding that the assets shall constitute a separate fund, shall not form part of the
transferee’s own estate and that the transferee shall have the power and the duty to manage the assets
for the charitable purpose specified by the transferor” (H. Kotz, 1999a, p. 88). This type of
relationship between parties can be analyzed as “fiduziarische Treuhand”, which has already been
discussed.

1.1.2. Contractual Trust Arrangements (CTAs)
German “trust-like devices” have gained the greatest importance in the sphere of the economy,
especially, through company law. Since the 90s of the 20 th century the so-called Contractual Trust
Arrangements (CTAs) have been increasingly utilized by different types of German companies.
These agreements enable each company “to improve its balance sheet ratios and creditworthiness in
accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), the United States Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles (US-GAAP) and German accounting rules pursuant to the German
Commercial Code by removing both the pension obligations towards its employees and the covering
assets from the balance sheet” (Rehahn et al., 2012, p. 103). Contractual Trust Arrangements are
focused on the following:


outsourcing obligations to a third person;



ensuring the settlement of employees’ pension claims;



protecting the covering assets against the access of the creditors in the event of the
insolvency of sponsoring undertaking.

The lack of a coherent trust concept in German law leads to difficulties during the fulfillment
of the last activity, because “in the event of the opening of insolvency proceedings regarding the
assets of the sponsoring undertaking, the trust agreement shall expire which would normally establish

p. 104). The given problem is usually solved by the creation of a second trust. This is the case of the
“doppelseitige Treuhand” (two-way trust).
In certain cases the members of personal companies or shareholders of public companies
transfer their rights of shareholders to a third party/a third person, who performs the functions of a
trustee. This trust solution “concerns a Kommanditgesellschaft, in which as a personally liable partner
a limited liability company participates with dozens, sometimes hundreds, of individual investors as
limited partners (Kommanditisten). Here, it would be impracticable to invite all those investors to
general meeting of the company so that each could separately exercise his rights as partner” (H. Kotz,
1999b, p. 56). Therefore, the best management option in such cases is the transference of the limited
partners’ interests to a single trustee, who is obliged to exercise them in the interest of investor partners. This mode of management is called “Gesellschaftsanteile” (administrative trust of company
shares).

1.1.3. Terminological Insights
An in-depth study of the contemporary German economic-juridical “trust-like devices” and
their English equivalents enables us to make some terminological insights. The major emphasis ought
to be put on the term “Treuhand”, because it is used “as a collective term in German legal literature
and legal practice, which summarizes many different legal relationships of property manageme nt”
(Sandor, 2014, p. 254).
The carried out terminological study vividly reveals that “Routledge German Dictionary of
Business, Commerce, and Finance” presents the following English equivalents of the German lexical
units related to the “Treuhand”:
“Treuhand – Trust;
Treuhänder – Trustee, fiduciary;
Treugeber – settlor, transferor, trustor (AmE)” (Routledge German Dictionary of Business,
Commerce, and Finance, 1997)
The same data is presented in H. Haschka and H. Schmatzer’s well-known work “Aspects of
U.S. business and law (An English-language survey with German-language comments)”. This book
directly indicates, that “the essential elements of a trust are:
-

A trustor or settler (Treugeber).

-

A beneficiary (Begünstigter).

-

-

A fund or corpus (zweckgebundere Vermögensmasse) the title to which passes to the trustee)”
(Haschka et al., 1990, p. 167).
Additionally, “Collins English-German Dictionary” presents the following German equivalents

of the common law term “trust”:


“(law, finance) Treuhand (schaft) f



(= property) Treuhandeigentum nt



(= charitable fund) Stiftung f“2.

The existence of all the above mentioned equivalents makes the essence of „Treuhand”obscure
and equalizes it with the Anglo-American “trust”. Some scholars have thoroughly discussed this
question, for instance, Sh. A. Stark directly indicated, that the term „Treuhand” had a purely German
origin: “the German word “treu” means true and implies faithful” (Stark Sh., 2009, p. 3). Despite this
explanation “the word Treuhand is not a clear term in German, it cannot be exclusively described as
a trust in English either. For this reason, it is best to continue using the German word Treuhand
because it has no equivalent in English” (Stark Sh., 2009, p. 3). J. Rehahn and A. Grimm share Stark’s
idea and state: “German law is neither able to produce exactly the same effects as a trust in common
law nor has it one specific concept that works as a trust… the German law does not know a
homogeneous concept of a trust…” (Rehahn et al., 2012, p. 94). According to J. Rehahn and A.
Grimm the term „Treuhand” must be translated as „German trust”. The scholars directly indicate,
that this will help with the “eradication” of any ambiguities during the process of translation. The
same English equivalent (German trust) of “Treuhand” is presented in the following passage of the
book “Property law and economics”: “Concerning the unitary ownership characteristic, society has
created different kinds of ownership, which can be seen as forms of divided ownership, as the
Treuhand (German trust) and fiducie-gestion (French trust)” (Bouckaert, 2010, p. 28). We believe,
that „German trust” is the best English translation of the term „Treuhand”. Moreover, it is
recommended to translate the “Treugeber” as the “German trustor/settlor” and to nominate the
“Treuhänder” as the “German trustee”.

Conclusions

Therefore, the juridical-economic study of the contemporary German reality vividly reveals
that it has no single institution which performs all the functions performed by the common law
“trust”. Even the “Treuhand” - a prime example of fiduciary arrangements - is irreconcilable with
the “trust”, namely, in the third party relationships. Some scholars directly indicate that German law
cannot cope with the doctrine of the “real subrogation”. This means that in those cases, when the
“Treuhänder” buys assets with the money supplied by the Treugeber “or with the proceeds of sales
of the original property, or obtains property it exchanges for the original property, it is not clear
whether the beneficiaries will be awarded a proprietary right in the substitute property and on this
basis take priority over the Treuhänder’s private creditors” (Kotz, 1999a, p. 95).
All the above mentioned directly indicates to the following prominent fact: the German court
has no general competence in exercising the supervisory and administrative functions needed to make
the “Treuhand” as effective as the “trust” in the issues of the management of property. Therefore,
the rules of the German law regulating the “fiduziarische Treuhand” need clarification and
improvement via defining the questions of third party relationships and “real subrogation”. Moreover,
significant changes must be made in the terminological sphere in order to reflect the difference
between the common law “trust” and German “Treuhand”. We believe that „German trust” is the
best English translation of the term „Treuhand”. Moreover, we recommend to translate “Treugeber”
as the “German trustor/settlor” and to nominate the “Treuhänder” as the “German trustee”.

Introduction
EU has not escaped the “overwhelming” process of globalization. It is vividly felt in almost all
branches of the economic, social and juridical spheres. Rapid developments are predicted in all areas
of human activities.
It’s a well-known fact, that the economy of a particular country as well as the law is not a static,
but a dynamic phenomenon. It is a vivid result of a historical evolution which did not happen on its
own, as if in a vacuum. Today’s globalizing processes stipulate the emergence of the institutions
which facilitate intensive financial transactions, profitable investments and increased flows of money.
The common law “trust” and its European “descendants” (German “Treuhand”, Italian “Fondo
patrimoniale”, French “Fiducie”, etc.) can be regarded among these institutions. The English “trust”
“is undoubtedly an extremely versatile instrument which is suitable for a great variety of purposes,
even leading some commentators to qualify it as a “universal fix-it” (Koessler, 2012, p. 13). Many
scholars believe, that the original form of this unique institution appeared in the common law of the
Middle Ages. In 1872 the trust law was adopted in the State of Connecticut, while the first trust
company was created in 1806 according to the recommendation of financier and politician A.
Hamilton. During the 19th century, the given legal institution became popular in the American
business sphere. It offered several economic and legal advantages, especially through mutual and
pension funds, while at the end of the 20 th century, the process of globalization stipulated the
“internationalization” of the trust mechanism. The starting point of this process was the conclusion
of the “Hague Convention on the Law Applicable to Trusts and on their Recognition” (1985) and its
ratification by 12 countries. Initially, the civil law jurisdictions were unable to adopt the “trust”
structure in which common-law power and equity power belonged to separate entities. Despite this
fact, in the recent years, “trust-like devices” have been introduced in certain economic-juridical
systems of Europe. Their rapid implementation raised the question of the establishment of innovative
policies for the management of the functioning of these newly-emerged constructions. This paper will
discuss the latest achievements and existing challenges on the example of German juridical-economic
system. Moreover, it will make proposals, which will be useful for a successful planning of the
European entrusting processes and terminological nomination of the concepts related to them.

1. German vis-à-vis English
It’s a well-known fact, that today’s Europe makes distinction between the civil and common
legal traditions. In our paper these traditions are presented by England (common law) and Germany
(civil law).
Many scholars believe that the greatest inconsistency between English and German
jurisdictions is presented in the area of “Property law”. The German legal system comprises an
absolute notion of ownership, which may be equalized with the Roman “dominium”. In the
German reality, “the owner of a corporeal object is the person who is in principle entitled to “deal
with the thing as he pleases and exclude others from any interference”. It belongs to him, and only
him” (Häcker, 2009, p. 36). In contrast to the German law, the English juridical system embraces
a non-absolute notion of ownership. “Firstly, English law adopts a system of relative titles as
opposed to absolute entitlements. Secondly, the recognition that equitable interests are in some
sense “proprietory” has led to the idea of ownership being “split” into bare legal title and an
equitable (or beneficial) interest” (Häcker, 2009, p. 35-36). This division has historical roots.
Moreover, it gave birth to the unique and remarkable common law institution named “trust”.

a) “the assets constitute a separate fund and are not a part of the trustee’s own estate;
b) title to the trust assets stands in the name of the trustee or in the name of another person on
behalf of the trustee;
c) the trustee has the power and the duty ... to manage, employ or dispose of the assets in
accordance with the terms of the trust and the special duties imposed upon him by law” 1.
It’s a well-known fact, that “German case law does not recognize the institution of the trust, as
the trust is incompatible with the dogmatic foundations of German law and does not resemble the
legal relationship of the Treuhand” (Sandor, 2014, p. 250). Moreover, “nowhere in German law can
one find any single institution which by itself performs all those functions for which the common
lawyer deploys the trust” (Kotz, 1999a, p. 85). However, the study of the contemporary German legal
system reveals the existence of several “trust-like devices”, which work differently, but perform
functions similar to the “trust”. B. Häcker directly indicates, that “in some situations a person holds
rights for the benefit of another, via a device described by the umbrella term Treuhand… A Treuhand
arises only in a limited number of particular instances (scattered throughout the BGB and developed
outside the statutory framework), each subject to its own specific rules and principles” (Häcker, 2009,
p. 39-40). Well-known German jurist Hein Kötz distinguishes three types of such institutions: “the
Testamentvollstreckung and Nacherbschaft, which are used to control succession to property for
several legatees (and typically for many years), the Stiftung which serves to collect and administer
funds for charitable purposes, and the general Treuhand by which an estate is administered for the
benefit of one or more persons” (Grundmann, 1998, p. 489). Stiftung, Testamentvollstreckung and
Nacherbschaft are often regarded as Quasitreuhands, while Treuhand is a prime example of
fiduciary arrangements of the German law.

1.1.Treuhand
The “Treuhand” is usually flexible and exempt from the state control. It considers the
transference of ownership based on “Vertrauen” (trust) and “Treue” (loyalty). It can be established
in three major ways: “through a full transfer of legal title (fiduziarische Vollrechtstreuhand), through
a transfer of legal title with conditions precedent (deutschrechtliche Treuhand), and with a mandate
granting dispositional rights (Ermächtigungstreuhand)” (Sandor, 2014, p. 253).

1 CONVENTION

ON THE LAW APPLICABLE TO TRUSTS AND ON THEIR RECOGNITION, available at:

Generally, the “Treuhand” “is created by a transfer of assets to the Treuhänder coupled with a
contractual agreement made between him and the transferor under which he assumes, normally in
consideration of a fee, a contractual duty to manage the assets in a particular way for the benefit of
the beneficiaries” (Kotz, 1999a, p. 89). In other words, “fiduziarische Treuhand” is a fiduciary
construction by which an individual transfers the full right in rem to the other individual. Therefore,
the entrusting relations consider the following major elements:
•

Treugeber (settlor/beneficiary) - an individual, which transfers the full right in rem to the
other individual, who is obliged to deal with the assets in the manner specified by the contract;

•

Treuhänder (trustee) – an individual, who is obliged to deal with the transferred assets in the
manner specified by the contract.
“The Treuhand can exist without any written underpinning document. It can be concluded

between any two persons capable of being party to a contract” (OECD, 2013, p. 39). Although in
most cases the “Treuhand” represents a two-party relationship, it can include third party
relationships. The “Treuhand” may take different forms: “hidden (verdeckte Treuhand) or disclosed
to third parties (offene Treuhand)” (OECD, 2013, p. 39-40).
It is also worth mentioning, that although the Treugeber transfers his juridical ownership to the
Treuhänder, he retains the economic ownership. Therefore, a trustee (Treuhänder) becomes a legal
owner, whose duties are called fiduciary duties: “The Treuhänder acquires a full and unrestricted title
to the Treuhand assets, whereas the beneficiaries’ interests are, at least in theory, merely the ordinary
rights in personam of parties to a contract” (Kotz, 1999a, p. 93). The Treuhänder can transfer the
legal title to a third person, while the Treugeber has only damages claims in those cases when the
transferor violates the obligations. It means that the “fiduziarische Treuhand” does not fully protect
the rights of the Treugeber. Therefore, the practical implementation of this construction seems quite
risky.
However, the German legal system gives the Treugeber an opportunity to make a safer
agreement (the so-called Ermächtigungstreuhand - trust by authorization), under which he (she)
does not transfer the full right in rem to the Treuhänder, but simply authorizes him (her) to manage
or dispose of the assets in a specific manner. When the trustee exceeds his authorization the disposal
of the assets is not valid … no real separation of property takes place and the protection of the settlor
is of minor importance because he is still the legal owner with all of his power” (Rehahn et al., 2012,

1.1.1.Stiftung
Stiftung is usually identified with a “charitable trust”. It belongs to the group of juristic entities
capable of owning property and of suing and being sued. If a person wants to dedicate assets to
charitable purposes or to devote patrimony to specific aims, he/she “must declare such an intention
in writing or by will (testamentary foundation), the Stiftungsgeschäft or endowment transaction”
(Rehahn et al., 2012, p. 102). The given transaction consists of two parties:


a founder (Stifter), which transfers a patrimony to a new legal entity and sets up rules of
administration;



a foundation (Stiftung) – a newly-created legal entity, which administers assets, but is
supervised by the Bundesland.

The “Stiftung” can be created only with the permission of the “Bundesland”, or the federal
state, where a newly-created legal entity will have its seat. It is worth mentioning that “apart from the
creation of a new legal entity, the trustor can also transfer the property to an already existing person
with the declaration that the transferee must separate these assets from his own property and has to
administer them on a continuing basis as the trustor has set it up” (Westebbe, 1993). Such type of a
transaction is nominated as “Stiftungstreuhand” or “unselbständige Stiftung”. The latter considers
the transference of a smaller amount of property. The founder “transfers assets as a gift inter vivos or
by will to another natural or juristic person – e.g. a university, a church, a museum, a charitable
association - on the understanding that the transferee keeps the assets transferred separate from his
own assets and that the gains made from the assets shall be used to further the charitable purpose
prescribed by the founder” (Kotz, 1999b, p. 52). It is worth mentioning that in the case of
“Stiftungstreuhand” or “unselbständige Stiftung” (foundation trust or dependent foundation), the
trustee’s creditors are not able to take legal actions in respect to the separated assets. These actions
can be impeded by a founder or by beneficiaries. This is a unique example of Sondervermögen
(separated patrimony). The existence of Sondervermögen emphasizes the fact, that German law
“accepts” the notion of “splitting-up” - owning of more than one patrimony by one person. Such
separation of assets is determined by the concept of patrimony rather than that of property, because
the German property law is not based on the distinction between legal property and equitable property.
The major reason for splitting is that “the separated patrimony serves specific functions such as
providing liable patrimony for specific creditors, a particular administration of that patrimony or the

Therefore, an in-depth study of Stiftung reveals its similarity to a “charitable trust”. However,
there are certain differences between these two institutions - the Stiftung (foundation) should be
registered, “the representatives of foundations do not act in their own name, and the founder may not
be exclusive manager (Vorstand) of the foundation. As an additional difference, the representatives
are also liable to third parties” (Selbig, 2006, p. 167). The establishment of Stiftung is quite
expensive. Therefore, a trustor can use a simpler and cheaper way. He/She may transfer “assets to
another on the understanding that the assets shall constitute a separate fund, shall not form part of the
transferee’s own estate and that the transferee shall have the power and the duty to manage the assets
for the charitable purpose specified by the transferor” (H. Kotz, 1999a, p. 88). This type of
relationship between parties can be analyzed as “fiduziarische Treuhand”, which has already been
discussed.

1.1.2. Contractual Trust Arrangements (CTAs)
German “trust-like devices” have gained the greatest importance in the sphere of the economy,
especially, through company law. Since the 90s of the 20 th century the so-called Contractual Trust
Arrangements (CTAs) have been increasingly utilized by different types of German companies.
These agreements enable each company “to improve its balance sheet ratios and creditworthiness in
accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), the United States Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles (US-GAAP) and German accounting rules pursuant to the German
Commercial Code by removing both the pension obligations towards its employees and the covering
assets from the balance sheet” (Rehahn et al., 2012, p. 103). Contractual Trust Arrangements are
focused on the following:


outsourcing obligations to a third person;



ensuring the settlement of employees’ pension claims;



protecting the covering assets against the access of the creditors in the event of the
insolvency of sponsoring undertaking.

The lack of a coherent trust concept in German law leads to difficulties during the fulfillment
of the last activity, because “in the event of the opening of insolvency proceedings regarding the
assets of the sponsoring undertaking, the trust agreement shall expire which would normally establish

p. 104). The given problem is usually solved by the creation of a second trust. This is the case of the
“doppelseitige Treuhand” (two-way trust).
In certain cases the members of personal companies or shareholders of public companies
transfer their rights of shareholders to a third party/a third person, who performs the functions of a
trustee. This trust solution “concerns a Kommanditgesellschaft, in which as a personally liable partner
a limited liability company participates with dozens, sometimes hundreds, of individual investors as
limited partners (Kommanditisten). Here, it would be impracticable to invite all those investors to
general meeting of the company so that each could separately exercise his rights as partner” (H. Kotz,
1999b, p. 56). Therefore, the best management option in such cases is the transference of the limited
partners’ interests to a single trustee, who is obliged to exercise them in the interest of investor partners. This mode of management is called “Gesellschaftsanteile” (administrative trust of company
shares).

1.1.3. Terminological Insights
An in-depth study of the contemporary German economic-juridical “trust-like devices” and
their English equivalents enables us to make some terminological insights. The major emphasis ought
to be put on the term “Treuhand”, because it is used “as a collective term in German legal literature
and legal practice, which summarizes many different legal relationships of property manageme nt”
(Sandor, 2014, p. 254).
The carried out terminological study vividly reveals that “Routledge German Dictionary of
Business, Commerce, and Finance” presents the following English equivalents of the German lexical
units related to the “Treuhand”:
“Treuhand – Trust;
Treuhänder – Trustee, fiduciary;
Treugeber – settlor, transferor, trustor (AmE)” (Routledge German Dictionary of Business,
Commerce, and Finance, 1997)
The same data is presented in H. Haschka and H. Schmatzer’s well-known work “Aspects of
U.S. business and law (An English-language survey with German-language comments)”. This book
directly indicates, that “the essential elements of a trust are:
-

A trustor or settler (Treugeber).

-

A beneficiary (Begünstigter).

-

-

A fund or corpus (zweckgebundere Vermögensmasse) the title to which passes to the trustee)”
(Haschka et al., 1990, p. 167).
Additionally, “Collins English-German Dictionary” presents the following German equivalents

of the common law term “trust”:


“(law, finance) Treuhand (schaft) f



(= property) Treuhandeigentum nt



(= charitable fund) Stiftung f“2.

The existence of all the above mentioned equivalents makes the essence of „Treuhand”obscure
and equalizes it with the Anglo-American “trust”. Some scholars have thoroughly discussed this
question, for instance, Sh. A. Stark directly indicated, that the term „Treuhand” had a purely German
origin: “the German word “treu” means true and implies faithful” (Stark Sh., 2009, p. 3). Despite this
explanation “the word Treuhand is not a clear term in German, it cannot be exclusively described as
a trust in English either. For this reason, it is best to continue using the German word Treuhand
because it has no equivalent in English” (Stark Sh., 2009, p. 3). J. Rehahn and A. Grimm share Stark’s
idea and state: “German law is neither able to produce exactly the same effects as a trust in common
law nor has it one specific concept that works as a trust… the German law does not know a
homogeneous concept of a trust…” (Rehahn et al., 2012, p. 94). According to J. Rehahn and A.
Grimm the term „Treuhand” must be translated as „German trust”. The scholars directly indicate,
that this will help with the “eradication” of any ambiguities during the process of translation. The
same English equivalent (German trust) of “Treuhand” is presented in the following passage of the
book “Property law and economics”: “Concerning the unitary ownership characteristic, society has
created different kinds of ownership, which can be seen as forms of divided ownership, as the
Treuhand (German trust) and fiducie-gestion (French trust)” (Bouckaert, 2010, p. 28). We believe,
that „German trust” is the best English translation of the term „Treuhand”. Moreover, it is
recommended to translate the “Treugeber” as the “German trustor/settlor” and to nominate the
“Treuhänder” as the “German trustee”.

Conclusions

Therefore, the juridical-economic study of the contemporary German reality vividly reveals
that it has no single institution which performs all the functions performed by the common law
“trust”. Even the “Treuhand” - a prime example of fiduciary arrangements - is irreconcilable with
the “trust”, namely, in the third party relationships. Some scholars directly indicate that German law
cannot cope with the doctrine of the “real subrogation”. This means that in those cases, when the
“Treuhänder” buys assets with the money supplied by the Treugeber “or with the proceeds of sales
of the original property, or obtains property it exchanges for the original property, it is not clear
whether the beneficiaries will be awarded a proprietary right in the substitute property and on this
basis take priority over the Treuhänder’s private creditors” (Kotz, 1999a, p. 95).
All the above mentioned directly indicates to the following prominent fact: the German court
has no general competence in exercising the supervisory and administrative functions needed to make
the “Treuhand” as effective as the “trust” in the issues of the management of property. Therefore,
the rules of the German law regulating the “fiduziarische Treuhand” need clarification and
improvement via defining the questions of third party relationships and “real subrogation”. Moreover,
significant changes must be made in the terminological sphere in order to reflect the difference
between the common law “trust” and German “Treuhand”. We believe that „German trust” is the
best English translation of the term „Treuhand”. Moreover, we recommend to translate “Treugeber”
as the “German trustor/settlor” and to nominate the “Treuhänder” as the “German trustee”.

Introduction
EU has not escaped the “overwhelming” process of globalization. It is vividly felt in almost all
branches of the economic, social and juridical spheres. Rapid developments are predicted in all areas
of human activities.
It’s a well-known fact, that the economy of a particular country as well as the law is not a static,
but a dynamic phenomenon. It is a vivid result of a historical evolution which did not happen on its
own, as if in a vacuum. Today’s globalizing processes stipulate the emergence of the institutions
which facilitate intensive financial transactions, profitable investments and increased flows of money.
The common law “trust” and its European “descendants” (German “Treuhand”, Italian “Fondo
patrimoniale”, French “Fiducie”, etc.) can be regarded among these institutions. The English “trust”
“is undoubtedly an extremely versatile instrument which is suitable for a great variety of purposes,
even leading some commentators to qualify it as a “universal fix-it” (Koessler, 2012, p. 13). Many
scholars believe, that the original form of this unique institution appeared in the common law of the
Middle Ages. In 1872 the trust law was adopted in the State of Connecticut, while the first trust
company was created in 1806 according to the recommendation of financier and politician A.
Hamilton. During the 19th century, the given legal institution became popular in the American
business sphere. It offered several economic and legal advantages, especially through mutual and
pension funds, while at the end of the 20 th century, the process of globalization stipulated the
“internationalization” of the trust mechanism. The starting point of this process was the conclusion
of the “Hague Convention on the Law Applicable to Trusts and on their Recognition” (1985) and its
ratification by 12 countries. Initially, the civil law jurisdictions were unable to adopt the “trust”
structure in which common-law power and equity power belonged to separate entities. Despite this
fact, in the recent years, “trust-like devices” have been introduced in certain economic-juridical
systems of Europe. Their rapid implementation raised the question of the establishment of innovative
policies for the management of the functioning of these newly-emerged constructions. This paper will
discuss the latest achievements and existing challenges on the example of German juridical-economic
system. Moreover, it will make proposals, which will be useful for a successful planning of the
European entrusting processes and terminological nomination of the concepts related to them.

1. German vis-à-vis English
It’s a well-known fact, that today’s Europe makes distinction between the civil and common
legal traditions. In our paper these traditions are presented by England (common law) and Germany
(civil law).
Many scholars believe that the greatest inconsistency between English and German
jurisdictions is presented in the area of “Property law”. The German legal system comprises an
absolute notion of ownership, which may be equalized with the Roman “dominium”. In the
German reality, “the owner of a corporeal object is the person who is in principle entitled to “deal
with the thing as he pleases and exclude others from any interference”. It belongs to him, and only
him” (Häcker, 2009, p. 36). In contrast to the German law, the English juridical system embraces
a non-absolute notion of ownership. “Firstly, English law adopts a system of relative titles as
opposed to absolute entitlements. Secondly, the recognition that equitable interests are in some
sense “proprietory” has led to the idea of ownership being “split” into bare legal title and an
equitable (or beneficial) interest” (Häcker, 2009, p. 35-36). This division has historical roots.
Moreover, it gave birth to the unique and remarkable common law institution named “trust”.

a) “the assets constitute a separate fund and are not a part of the trustee’s own estate;
b) title to the trust assets stands in the name of the trustee or in the name of another person on
behalf of the trustee;
c) the trustee has the power and the duty ... to manage, employ or dispose of the assets in
accordance with the terms of the trust and the special duties imposed upon him by law” 1.
It’s a well-known fact, that “German case law does not recognize the institution of the trust, as
the trust is incompatible with the dogmatic foundations of German law and does not resemble the
legal relationship of the Treuhand” (Sandor, 2014, p. 250). Moreover, “nowhere in German law can
one find any single institution which by itself performs all those functions for which the common
lawyer deploys the trust” (Kotz, 1999a, p. 85). However, the study of the contemporary German legal
system reveals the existence of several “trust-like devices”, which work differently, but perform
functions similar to the “trust”. B. Häcker directly indicates, that “in some situations a person holds
rights for the benefit of another, via a device described by the umbrella term Treuhand… A Treuhand
arises only in a limited number of particular instances (scattered throughout the BGB and developed
outside the statutory framework), each subject to its own specific rules and principles” (Häcker, 2009,
p. 39-40). Well-known German jurist Hein Kötz distinguishes three types of such institutions: “the
Testamentvollstreckung and Nacherbschaft, which are used to control succession to property for
several legatees (and typically for many years), the Stiftung which serves to collect and administer
funds for charitable purposes, and the general Treuhand by which an estate is administered for the
benefit of one or more persons” (Grundmann, 1998, p. 489). Stiftung, Testamentvollstreckung and
Nacherbschaft are often regarded as Quasitreuhands, while Treuhand is a prime example of
fiduciary arrangements of the German law.

1.1.Treuhand
The “Treuhand” is usually flexible and exempt from the state control. It considers the
transference of ownership based on “Vertrauen” (trust) and “Treue” (loyalty). It can be established
in three major ways: “through a full transfer of legal title (fiduziarische Vollrechtstreuhand), through
a transfer of legal title with conditions precedent (deutschrechtliche Treuhand), and with a mandate
granting dispositional rights (Ermächtigungstreuhand)” (Sandor, 2014, p. 253).

ON THE LAW APPLICABLE TO TRUSTS AND ON THEIR RECOGNITION, available at:

Generally, the “Treuhand” “is created by a transfer of assets to the Treuhänder coupled with a
contractual agreement made between him and the transferor under which he assumes, normally in
consideration of a fee, a contractual duty to manage the assets in a particular way for the benefit of
the beneficiaries” (Kotz, 1999a, p. 89). In other words, “fiduziarische Treuhand” is a fiduciary
construction by which an individual transfers the full right in rem to the other individual. Therefore,
the entrusting relations consider the following major elements:
•

Treugeber (settlor/beneficiary) - an individual, which transfers the full right in rem to the
other individual, who is obliged to deal with the assets in the manner specified by the contract;

•

Treuhänder (trustee) – an individual, who is obliged to deal with the transferred assets in the
manner specified by the contract.
“The Treuhand can exist without any written underpinning document. It can be concluded

between any two persons capable of being party to a contract” (OECD, 2013, p. 39). Although in
most cases the “Treuhand” represents a two-party relationship, it can include third party
relationships. The “Treuhand” may take different forms: “hidden (verdeckte Treuhand) or disclosed
to third parties (offene Treuhand)” (OECD, 2013, p. 39-40).
It is also worth mentioning, that although the Treugeber transfers his juridical ownership to the
Treuhänder, he retains the economic ownership. Therefore, a trustee (Treuhänder) becomes a legal
owner, whose duties are called fiduciary duties: “The Treuhänder acquires a full and unrestricted title
to the Treuhand assets, whereas the beneficiaries’ interests are, at least in theory, merely the ordinary
rights in personam of parties to a contract” (Kotz, 1999a, p. 93). The Treuhänder can transfer the
legal title to a third person, while the Treugeber has only damages claims in those cases when the
transferor violates the obligations. It means that the “fiduziarische Treuhand” does not fully protect
the rights of the Treugeber. Therefore, the practical implementation of this construction seems quite
risky.
However, the German legal system gives the Treugeber an opportunity to make a safer
agreement (the so-called Ermächtigungstreuhand - trust by authorization), under which he (she)
does not transfer the full right in rem to the Treuhänder, but simply authorizes him (her) to manage
or dispose of the assets in a specific manner. When the trustee exceeds his authorization the disposal
of the assets is not valid … no real separation of property takes place and the protection of the settlor
is of minor importance because he is still the legal owner with all of his power” (Rehahn et al., 2012,

1.1.1.Stiftung
Stiftung is usually identified with a “charitable trust”. It belongs to the group of juristic entities
capable of owning property and of suing and being sued. If a person wants to dedicate assets to
charitable purposes or to devote patrimony to specific aims, he/she “must declare such an intention
in writing or by will (testamentary foundation), the Stiftungsgeschäft or endowment transaction”
(Rehahn et al., 2012, p. 102). The given transaction consists of two parties:


a founder (Stifter), which transfers a patrimony to a new legal entity and sets up rules of
administration;



a foundation (Stiftung) – a newly-created legal entity, which administers assets, but is
supervised by the Bundesland.

The “Stiftung” can be created only with the permission of the “Bundesland”, or the federal
state, where a newly-created legal entity will have its seat. It is worth mentioning that “apart from the
creation of a new legal entity, the trustor can also transfer the property to an already existing person
with the declaration that the transferee must separate these assets from his own property and has to
administer them on a continuing basis as the trustor has set it up” (Westebbe, 1993). Such type of a
transaction is nominated as “Stiftungstreuhand” or “unselbständige Stiftung”. The latter considers
the transference of a smaller amount of property. The founder “transfers assets as a gift inter vivos or
by will to another natural or juristic person – e.g. a university, a church, a museum, a charitable
association - on the understanding that the transferee keeps the assets transferred separate from his
own assets and that the gains made from the assets shall be used to further the charitable purpose
prescribed by the founder” (Kotz, 1999b, p. 52). It is worth mentioning that in the case of
“Stiftungstreuhand” or “unselbständige Stiftung” (foundation trust or dependent foundation), the
trustee’s creditors are not able to take legal actions in respect to the separated assets. These actions
can be impeded by a founder or by beneficiaries. This is a unique example of Sondervermögen
(separated patrimony). The existence of Sondervermögen emphasizes the fact, that German law
“accepts” the notion of “splitting-up” - owning of more than one patrimony by one person. Such
separation of assets is determined by the concept of patrimony rather than that of property, because
the German property law is not based on the distinction between legal property and equitable property.
The major reason for splitting is that “the separated patrimony serves specific functions such as
providing liable patrimony for specific creditors, a particular administration of that patrimony or the

Therefore, an in-depth study of Stiftung reveals its similarity to a “charitable trust”. However,
there are certain differences between these two institutions - the Stiftung (foundation) should be
registered, “the representatives of foundations do not act in their own name, and the founder may not
be exclusive manager (Vorstand) of the foundation. As an additional difference, the representatives
are also liable to third parties” (Selbig, 2006, p. 167). The establishment of Stiftung is quite
expensive. Therefore, a trustor can use a simpler and cheaper way. He/She may transfer “assets to
another on the understanding that the assets shall constitute a separate fund, shall not form part of the
transferee’s own estate and that the transferee shall have the power and the duty to manage the assets
for the charitable purpose specified by the transferor” (H. Kotz, 1999a, p. 88). This type of
relationship between parties can be analyzed as “fiduziarische Treuhand”, which has already been
discussed.

1.1.2. Contractual Trust Arrangements (CTAs)
German “trust-like devices” have gained the greatest importance in the sphere of the economy,
especially, through company law. Since the 90s of the 20 th century the so-called Contractual Trust
Arrangements (CTAs) have been increasingly utilized by different types of German companies.
These agreements enable each company “to improve its balance sheet ratios and creditworthiness in
accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), the United States Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles (US-GAAP) and German accounting rules pursuant to the German
Commercial Code by removing both the pension obligations towards its employees and the covering
assets from the balance sheet” (Rehahn et al., 2012, p. 103). Contractual Trust Arrangements are
focused on the following:


outsourcing obligations to a third person;



ensuring the settlement of employees’ pension claims;



protecting the covering assets against the access of the creditors in the event of the
insolvency of sponsoring undertaking.

The lack of a coherent trust concept in German law leads to difficulties during the fulfillment
of the last activity, because “in the event of the opening of insolvency proceedings regarding the
assets of the sponsoring undertaking, the trust agreement shall expire which would normally establish

p. 104). The given problem is usually solved by the creation of a second trust. This is the case of the
“doppelseitige Treuhand” (two-way trust).
In certain cases the members of personal companies or shareholders of public companies
transfer their rights of shareholders to a third party/a third person, who performs the functions of a
trustee. This trust solution “concerns a Kommanditgesellschaft, in which as a personally liable partner
a limited liability company participates with dozens, sometimes hundreds, of individual investors as
limited partners (Kommanditisten). Here, it would be impracticable to invite all those investors to
general meeting of the company so that each could separately exercise his rights as partner” (H. Kotz,
1999b, p. 56). Therefore, the best management option in such cases is the transference of the limited
partners’ interests to a single trustee, who is obliged to exercise them in the interest of investor partners. This mode of management is called “Gesellschaftsanteile” (administrative trust of company
shares).

1.1.3. Terminological Insights
An in-depth study of the contemporary German economic-juridical “trust-like devices” and
their English equivalents enables us to make some terminological insights. The major emphasis ought
to be put on the term “Treuhand”, because it is used “as a collective term in German legal literature
and legal practice, which summarizes many different legal relationships of property manageme nt”
(Sandor, 2014, p. 254).
The carried out terminological study vividly reveals that “Routledge German Dictionary of
Business, Commerce, and Finance” presents the following English equivalents of the German lexical
units related to the “Treuhand”:
“Treuhand – Trust;
Treuhänder – Trustee, fiduciary;
Treugeber – settlor, transferor, trustor (AmE)” (Routledge German Dictionary of Business,
Commerce, and Finance, 1997)
The same data is presented in H. Haschka and H. Schmatzer’s well-known work “Aspects of
U.S. business and law (An English-language survey with German-language comments)”. This book
directly indicates, that “the essential elements of a trust are:
-

A trustor or settler (Treugeber).

-

A beneficiary (Begünstigter).

-

-

A fund or corpus (zweckgebundere Vermögensmasse) the title to which passes to the trustee)”
(Haschka et al., 1990, p. 167).
Additionally, “Collins English-German Dictionary” presents the following German equivalents

of the common law term “trust”:


“(law, finance) Treuhand (schaft) f



(= property) Treuhandeigentum nt



(= charitable fund) Stiftung f“2.

The existence of all the above mentioned equivalents makes the essence of „Treuhand”obscure
and equalizes it with the Anglo-American “trust”. Some scholars have thoroughly discussed this
question, for instance, Sh. A. Stark directly indicated, that the term „Treuhand” had a purely German
origin: “the German word “treu” means true and implies faithful” (Stark Sh., 2009, p. 3). Despite this
explanation “the word Treuhand is not a clear term in German, it cannot be exclusively described as
a trust in English either. For this reason, it is best to continue using the German word Treuhand
because it has no equivalent in English” (Stark Sh., 2009, p. 3). J. Rehahn and A. Grimm share Stark’s
idea and state: “German law is neither able to produce exactly the same effects as a trust in common
law nor has it one specific concept that works as a trust… the German law does not know a
homogeneous concept of a trust…” (Rehahn et al., 2012, p. 94). According to J. Rehahn and A.
Grimm the term „Treuhand” must be translated as „German trust”. The scholars directly indicate,
that this will help with the “eradication” of any ambiguities during the process of translation. The
same English equivalent (German trust) of “Treuhand” is presented in the following passage of the
book “Property law and economics”: “Concerning the unitary ownership characteristic, society has
created different kinds of ownership, which can be seen as forms of divided ownership, as the
Treuhand (German trust) and fiducie-gestion (French trust)” (Bouckaert, 2010, p. 28). We believe,
that „German trust” is the best English translation of the term „Treuhand”. Moreover, it is
recommended to translate the “Treugeber” as the “German trustor/settlor” and to nominate the
“Treuhänder” as the “German trustee”.

Conclusions

Therefore, the juridical-economic study of the contemporary German reality vividly reveals
that it has no single institution which performs all the functions performed by the common law
“trust”. Even the “Treuhand” - a prime example of fiduciary arrangements - is irreconcilable with
the “trust”, namely, in the third party relationships. Some scholars directly indicate that German law
cannot cope with the doctrine of the “real subrogation”. This means that in those cases, when the
“Treuhänder” buys assets with the money supplied by the Treugeber “or with the proceeds of sales
of the original property, or obtains property it exchanges for the original property, it is not clear
whether the beneficiaries will be awarded a proprietary right in the substitute property and on this
basis take priority over the Treuhänder’s private creditors” (Kotz, 1999a, p. 95).
All the above mentioned directly indicates to the following prominent fact: the German court
has no general competence in exercising the supervisory and administrative functions needed to make
the “Treuhand” as effective as the “trust” in the issues of the management of property. Therefore,
the rules of the German law regulating the “fiduziarische Treuhand” need clarification and
improvement via defining the questions of third party relationships and “real subrogation”. Moreover,
significant changes must be made in the terminological sphere in order to reflect the difference
between the common law “trust” and German “Treuhand”. We believe that „German trust” is the
best English translation of the term „Treuhand”. Moreover, we recommend to translate “Treugeber”
as the “German trustor/settlor” and to nominate the “Treuhänder” as the “German trustee”.
