chieving sustainable development is the leitmotif of today’s long-term forecasts and assessments of the society’s progress. This concept
was elaborated upon in the 17 goals approved by the
UN General Assembly in 2015 and set for implementation by 2030 [UN, 2015]. The sustainable development
idea is the embodiment of humanity’s perfectly legitimate hope to create a new prosperous society offering
relatively equal universal access to the benefits of civilization, while dangerous diseases, key factors of environment pollution, racial and other forms of discrimination – everything that makes the present-day world
less-than-perfect, unfair, wasteful, and even dangerous  — should be eradicated. The UN documents
present the sustainable long-term transformation of
society as a new quality of life for future generations.
And fundamentally new, non-carbon power industry
is supposed to become the most important resource
for implementing the sustainable development model.
The present generation is expected to lay the foundation for achieving the above goals in the process ensuring their validity, compliance with long-term development trends, and appropriateness of the effort.
Social development is an innovative, frequently chaotic process with a high degree of uncertainty and
risk [Milovidov, 2015a]. The prominent American
anthropologist David Graeber [Graeber, 2015] raises
a question about where all the inventions every child
dreamed of in the middle of the 20th century are now.
These include things such as teleportation, protective
force fields, tractor beams, Martian colonies, tricorders
for remote diagnostics, flying cars, and so on. People
make mistakes trying to predict the future all the time,
while achievements and ideas that look important and
significant at one stage of technological development
do not always remain so during subsequent stages –
not by far. History knows many examples of one fashion being replaced by another without turning into, as
Jared Diamond put it, “the mother of necessity” [Diamond, 1997]. Even nuclear energy, seemingly cheap
and potentially capable of drastically changing human
life, no longer stirs the imagination. However, the fate
of the aviation and automotive industries, the internal
combustion engine or petrol technologies – disruptive
innovations that revolutionized the lives and activities of billions of people – turned out to be completely
different. Today humanity is facing the challenge of
moving to a new development stage without choosing
wrong technological drivers and correctly estimating
the resources we still have at our disposal.
The paper analyzes the links between economic development, technology, and humanity’s energy potential.
It also assesses the risks associated with implementing
the sustainable development concept, which in our
opinion is fraught with lasting stagnation and even
regress.

Civilization’s Leap Forward and Energy
Resources

Vaclav Smil, a prominent Canadian researcher of energy innovation, wrote: “Modern civilization is the product of the incessant large-scale combustion of coals,
oils, and natural gases and of the steadily expanding
generation of electricity from fossil fuels, as well as
from the kinetic energy of water and the fissioning of
uranium nuclei” [Smil, 2010].
Given the current desire of a number of developed
countries to abandon nuclear energy, the last statement looks a bit like a stretch, but on the whole this
statement obviously seems to be valid. The structure
of energy consumption is not just linked to the nature
and formats of social development, but largely determines them.
The above correlation became the subject of a number of recent studies. Smil was one of the first to try
to describe and measure it [Smil, 1991]. Subsequently
this work was continued by an international group of
scientists comprising Timothy Lenton, Peter-Paul Pichler, and Helga Weisz [Lenton et al., 2016]. The British
economist Angus Maddison compiled data on global
GDP growth over a period of more than 2,000 years
[Maddison, 2001]. Today experts at the University of
Groningen maintain a regularly updated database of
global GDP growth using Maddison’s methodology1.
The aggregated results of these studies are published
on websites devoted to economic history and those in
the scope of a special program to promote historical
knowledge, “Our World in Data,” implemented by the
University of Oxford [University of Oxford, n.d.]. Such
resources allow one to compare the level of energy
consumption with economic growth rate at various
stages of human history. A look at global GDP’s longterm growth trend (Figure 1) immediately reveals its
exponential nature starting from the industrial revolution of the mid-18th century. If in 1700 global GDP was
estimated at $643.3 billion, 120 years later it has almost
doubled to $1.2 trillion. By 1900 it tripled to $3.42 trillion, and by the end of the 20th century global GDP
reached $63.1 trillion, that is, it grew by 18.5 times, or
100 times in 300 years. In a historical perspective, this
looks very much like a civilisational explosion.
The prominent US futurist Ray Kurzweil is given credit
for the term the second half of the chessboard, which
he used to describe exponential processes [Kurzweil,
2004]. It was not something Kurzweil invented; he simply introduced the well-known parable of a chessboard
into academic discourse: if the number of grains placed
on its cells doubles in each subsequent cell, it begins to
grow rapidly from the fifth rank. The data presented in
Figure 1 allows one to view the industrial revolution as
an exponentially scalable event (ESE) leading to radical changes in society [Milovidov, 2015b]. So which

noted that energy saving suggestions were first made
during the industrial revolution era.
The prominent English economist William Jevons was
one of the first to note the energy consumption effect.
He formulated the paradox subsequently named after
himself, the Jevons paradox: finding ways to use a resource more efficiently leads to the increased consumption of said resource [Jevons, 1865]. As subsequent research demonstrated, this effect was not limited just
to the period of the industrial revolution alone [Rubin,
2004; Herring, 2006; Polimeni, 2008]. Smil referred to
the same research when he refuted the myth about energy efficiency leading to reduced energy usage [Smil,
2010]. In the context of the above studies, reducing energy inputs for the production of $1 billion of GDP can
be interpreted not as increased energy efficiency but
as the reduced energy basis for extended reproduction.
Thus, from the very beginning of the industrial revolution, humanity has been moving towards an inevitable
shortage of energy resources, which in the long term
is fraught with reduced economic growth. The current
level of energy consumption is a necessary condition
of social development. Resources like oil and gas have
significantly accelerated the progress of civilization in

factors led to such a powerful increase in the scale and
effectiveness of human activities?
Apart from technological inventions such as the steam
engine, energy resources have had a special place
among the factors of the global economy’s exponential growth since the industrial revolution, above all
coal, whose production became a powerful development driver [Allen, 2009]. If in 1800 the consumption
of energy generated by burning coal amounted to
96.2 TWh (or 1.8% of the total) and energy produced
by burning wood and other biofuels 5,555.56 TWh
(98.3%), by 1850 the share of coal in the total energy
balance had increased to 7.3% (569.44 TWh), and by
1900 to 47.3% [University of Oxford, n.d.]. The industrial revolution was in effect a coal revolution, leading
to a skyrocketing rise in fossil fuel consumption compared with the customary, biological fuel types used
for thousands of years. As a result, it contributed to a
sharp increase in overall energy consumption.
Timothy Lenton et al. tried to estimate energy consumption over tens of thousands of years [Lenton et
al., 2016]. Their data confirms that the exponential
growth of energy consumption declined during the
industrial revolution and clearly follows the GDP
growth rate (Table 1). It is also noteworthy that the
amount of energy required to produce $1 billion of
GDP has dropped from 5.2 TWh (according to Lenton et al., 13.86 TWh) in 1820 to 1.4 TWh in 2015.
This figure is expected to further drop to 1.2–0.6 TWh
by 2050. An obvious interpretation of these dynamics is the growing energy efficiency of human activities due to the increase in power plants’ productivity
in the modern economy. If so, how do we explain the
extremely low energy consumption for the production of material goods at the beginning of the new era,
at 0.3 TWh? Does it mean our ancestors were able to
achieve better results at the level of energy consumption we will only be getting close to by the middle of
the 21st century?
Low energy intensity can be explained by various reasons that are related to the particular characteristics
of the energy being used and the nature of the work.
The alleged energy efficiency of economic activities in
ancient times was due to the lack of a wide choice of
energy resources available for production purposes
and relevant technologies. Fire was the main source of
energy, while work remained predominantly manual
or was based on making use of the propelling force of
domestic animals. People were gradually harnessing
the energy of water and wind, however, despite these
technological discoveries, the notional “energy balance” remained extremely primitive and deficient.
The 18th century industrial revolution radically
changed the situation, bringing in not only radically
new steam engine technology, but also new energy
resources. It was the mass proliferation of coal as an
energy resource that led to the significant increase of
energy inputs for the production of GDP. It should be

the 20th century. In 1900, oil was the source of 180.56
TWh of consumed energy (1.5% of total consumption),
while in 2000 this figure grew to 41,747.31 TWh (36%).
The 21st century opens promising prospects for generating energy from natural gas, whose share in the energy balance has been steadily growing since World War
II. In 1950, 2,091.67 TWh of consumed energy was
generated by burning natural gas (7.5%) and in 2015,
the relevant figure reached 36,596.66 TWh (24.3%)
[University of Oxford, n.d.].
The application of new technologies combined with
new energy resources supported the civilizational leap
humanity made over the last 150 years. In the 20th century, the production of material resources grew eightfold while global GDP grew 23 times (or 18 times in
2011 prices) [Hilty, Aebischer, 2015]. There is an obvious gap between these two development indicators.
What would narrowing this gap lead to? The answer
largely depends upon the correct classification of risks.
The currently very popular sustainable development
logic and the ubiquitous supranational bureaucracy
dictate the need to save resources, limit consumption,
overcome material inequality, and fairly distribute
material wealth. However, these objectives must be accomplished in an integrated and balanced way. Identifying them in the flow of more significant facts, designing optimal algorithms for managing innovation
development, and comprehensively assessing initiatives using a broad range of the relevant indicators and
risks are critically important for predicting the energy
future [Milovidov, 2015с].

A Quest for Disruptive Innovations

In the mid-1990s, Clayton Christensen proposed the
disruptive innovations concept, that is, technologies
and inventions that fundamentally change the accustomed way of life [Christensen, 1997]. Typically, the
proliferation of such innovations happens exponentially: they are adopted by a large number of users and
become instrumental to human activities until the next
wave of innovation comes. A specific feature of disruptive innovations is that at the early stage only a small
group of people tend to be aware of them while the
general public does not pay much attention and sees
them as something exotic, irrelevant, or just curious.
That is why such innovations are very hard to identify
or predict, their disruptive nature only becomes evident at a stage when preventing their proliferation is
no longer possible [Milovidov, 2018].
Many large companies fell victim to disruptive innovations. The energy industry’s history abounds with
such examples, in energy resource production, transformation into energy, and energy consumption by
industry and households alike. Frequently such innovations appeared due to the explosive development

of technologies in other areas such as the automobile
industry, communications, new production processes
or materials, and so on. There was a time when simply using electricity at home was a disruptive innovation that replaced many other ways to supply energy
to households. For example, in 1908 only 10% of US
households were electrified, but already by 1928 their
share grew to 64%, and by 1958 to 99% [University of
Oxford, n.d.].
More impressive technological developments in the
“information” century (21st century) are one way or another related to storing and analyzing large volumes
of information, so-called “big data” [Milovidov, 2017].
These technologies create additional demand for energy resources. In 2007, Laetitia Souchon et al. analyzed the phenomenon of the “energy iceberg” which
amounts to the fact that energy consumption by ICT
infrastructure (internet servers, mobile networks’ base
stations, data centers, uninterrupted power sources,
etc.) is significantly higher than energy consumption by
end user devices (PCs and mobile phones) [Souchon et
al., 2007]. On the whole, infrastructures’ share may be
as high as two-thirds of the total energy consumption.
According to the estimates by a Swedish research team
headed by Jens Malmodin, global ICT-related energy
consumption (including infrastructure and end user
devices) in 2007 amounted to 1,286 TWh [Malmodin
et al., 2010]. Estimates and forecasts by other authors
allow one to conclude that energy consumption will
keep growing due to the increasing informatization of
the society [Hilty, Aebischer, 2015].
The proliferation of technologies such as social networks and cryptocurrencies further increases the
pressure on expected energy consumption growth. Between 2011-2016 energy demand by Facebook grew
from 532 GWh to 1,830 GWh (or 0.5-1.8 TWh), or
more than threefold2. If the current energy consumption growth rate remains in place, in 2050 this social
network may use more than 10 TWh. Bitcoin miners
demonstrate an even more impressive rate of energy
consumption growth. According to Digiconomist portal, in just over a year, between February 2017 and July
2018, energy inputs for the emission (mining) and circulation of this cryptocurrency grew from 9.6 TWh to
71 TWh, coming close to the total national energy consumption in countries like Chile. This is 1.7% of the
total energy consumption in the US, 7.5% in Russia,
12.4% in Germany, or 29.9% in Australia3.
Only research and development of profoundly new
energy supply technologies can provide an answer to
the radical emergence of information society and its
growing energy consumption. However, the amount
of funding allocated for such R&D illogically follows
very obvious cycles determined by the changing situation on energy markets (Figure 2), which clearly shows

production of such vehicles was launched [Smil, 2010].
A few years later, however, internal combustion engine
cars took the lead, not only because of their speed and
power but primarily due to better opportunities for
scaling production, supply chains for components and
parts, and ultimately assembly belt production which
allowed for cutting costs and significantly increasing
profits. Now the world is turning back to the electric
vehicle concept, armed with advanced technologies,
and pursuing much more ambitious goals. Several
countries intend to completely the stop the production
of internal combustion vehicles in 2040. Let us take a
look at the factors that could seriously undermine faith
in electric cars in the medium term.
The production of cars in general and electric vehicles
in particular is an extremely energy-intensive process. In 2010, scientists at the US Argonne National
Laboratory estimated the total energy inputs of the
full automobile production cycle over the past 30 years
[Sullivan et al., 2010]. In 1972-2010, this figure varied
between 13.5 and 52.8 GJ (3.75×10-6 – 14.7×10-6 TWh).
The authors’ own assessment falls in the same range, at
33.92 GJ (9.42×10-6 TWh). According to their calculations, the amount of energy needed to make an electric vehicle is 50.73 GJ (14.09×10-6 TWh), that is, the
production cycle of internal combustion cars is more
energy efficient. The above calculations can be supplemented with data on energy consumption during the
vehicles’ operation for 10 years’ time, as an example.
In the case of internal combustion cars, total energy
consumption can reach 247 GJ (68.6×10-6 TWh) and
for electric vehicles – 187 GJ (51.94×10-6 TWh), that

that most countries completely lack any strategic longterm research policies for this area. At the same time,
if we look at the structure of overall public R&D expenditures, we will see that, for example, in the US in
2006-2016, the share of energy-related R&D funding
grew from 6.67% to 9.33%. This is comparable with
the growth of expenditures on aerospace-related R&D
(from 4.79 to 8.64% [NSF, 2018]), whose share in total public R&D expenditures is much (several times)
lower than investments in military-related intellectual
activities.
The cyclic nature of energy-related R&D funding is accompanied by structural shifts in the scope and focus
of such research. According to the International Energy Agency, in 1974-2017 the share of expenditures
on nuclear energy-related R&D dropped from 75%
to 19% and remained unchanged (at 8-9%) in the fossil fuel segment. The share of expenditures on energy
efficiency-related R&D grew from 4% to 23%, and on
R&D in the renewable energy and energy storage fields
– from 3% to 19% and from 2% to 9%, respectively.
Note that expenditures on interdisciplinary R&D grew
from 8% to 20% [IEA, n.d.], while the funding for the
development of seemingly disruptive energy innovations such as fuel cells or hydrogen energy remained
quite modest, at less than 3% of the total.
Google Trends4 allows one to identify topics that are
most popular among internet users. Very specialized
queries are commonly made along with the most general ones, such as “new energy” or “energy efficiency”.
If the former was at the top of the list (60 points out
of 100) in New Zealand, Colombia, Italy, Indonesia,
Pakistan, and Poland, the latter (41 points) turned
out to be more interesting to users in Sri Lanka, Saudi
Arabia, Hong Kong, Portugal, Finland, and South Africa. Meanwhile for the whole interval observed since
2004 this query’s popularity has dropped from 64 to
24 points. The popularity of “fuel cells” queries rapidly
decreased from 86 points in 2004 to 9 points in June
2018. However, in Denmark, Japan, Mexico, Taiwan,
Egypt, and Iran interest in this topic remained high.
The popularity of a query on another potentially disruptive technology, “energy storage”, grew from 14 to
20 points, mainly in South Korea, the Czech Republic,
Iran, Thailand, Egypt, and Portugal. Finally, attention
to technologies for harvesting kinetic energy during
the operation of various mechanisms or people’s movements is not yet very high (at just 3 points) and was
mainly noted in South Korea, Taiwan, Iran, Malaysia,
and Japan. In other words, an analysis of search queries does not reveal any fundamentally new trends.



is, for the ten-year long term. The difference is slightly
more than 30%5, while for a two-year period there is
no difference at all. This is without taking into account
a multitude of additional circumstances that over several years can tip the scales in one direction or another.
Thus, according to the estimates by Oxford experts,
the energy required to charge the battery of a Tesla
Semi heavy electric lorry is equivalent to the total energy consumption of 4,000 average private households
[WEF, 2017].
Taken together with annual car sales forecasts, the
above estimates allow one to expect the arrival of the
new automobile production era in 2040, when according to the author’s calculations, energy inputs will reach
1,130 TWh for internal combustion cars and 704 TWh
for electric vehicles. When the production of the first
type is discontinued, the second one will have to take
over the relevant market share. As a result, annual energy consumption can reach 1,600-2,800  TWh (approximately 240 million tons of oil equivalent), which
is 2.3-3.8 times more than current total consumption
by all production (and related) facilities in the automobile industry. The significant growth of energy consumption due to the mass adoption of all kinds and
models of electric vehicles will probably create additional demand for conventional energy sources.
Switching to electric cars will create a challenge for the
mining industry and battery manufacturers. Making
one electric car battery requires between 5 and 15 kg of
cobalt and no adequate alternatives for it have yet been
found (though relevant research is underway) [Felter,
2018]. Global explored reserves of cobalt are estimated
at 25 million tons and taking into account the ocean
floor, 120 million tons. However, manufacturers tend
to refer to the U.S. Geological Survey data according
to which in 2017, the officially confirmed industrially
developed reserves amounted to 7.1 million tons. The
current annual production of 110,000-120,000 tons by
2026 may grow to 190,000 tons [USGS, 2018]. Therefore, with average annual output of 150,000 tons global
cobalt reserves will be depleted by 2064 or 24 years after the world is supposed to switch to electric vehicles.
The competition for cobalt deposits has already begun
and is reflected in the growing prices for this metal.
Today 60% of cobalt is produced by the Democratic
Republic of Congo (DRC) in cooperation with China,
which supports the full cycle of cobalt production including processing. This gives some experts grounds
to speak about the dominance of the Chinese “supply
chain”, which prompts a number of countries, Germany in particular, to look for alternative suppliers. Russia
is not among the major cobalt producers, its domestic
reserves are relatively small. However, according to
the EU list of critical raw materials approved by the
European Commission in 2017, Russia is listed as the

main supplier of this metal in the EU with a 91% share.
A possible competitor is Finland where increased market prices made it possible to start mining cobalt in
2017, bringing the EU’s self-sufficiency to 32% [European Commission, 2017].
Given the aforementioned conditions, the road to complete vehicle electrification will be complex and controversial, raising questions not only about the energy
efficiency of production but also about socio-political
aspects, such as the exploitation of labor at Congolese
mines or atmospheric pollution by metallurgical companies. The redistribution of commodity markets and
other systemic risks, including environmental ones,
also cannot be ruled out. The low efficiency of renewable energy remains a serious challenge. The efficiency
factor in power generation reaches its highest values
(up to 90%) in hydropower engineering, while when
electricity is generated by burning fossil fuels (coal, oil
and gas) energy losses exceed 60%6. However, alternative energy sources do not offer fundamental solutions. The efficiency of wind generation still remains
under 37%, solar energy has less than 20%, and that
of biomass processing has efficiency of just over 35%.
Fuel cells demonstrate the best values among alternative energy sources. Depending on the type of media
(e.g. molten carbonate), their efficiency can reach 57%,
which is slightly higher than gas-based generation
(55%). Fuel cells are more efficient than coal (40-45%)
and oil products (37%)7, though not to a radical degree.
The amount of investments required for the development of this technology, the projects’ internal rate of
return, and equipment installation costs can negate
any possible benefits from it.
However, biased as this conclusion may appear, no
adequate (in cost and efficiency terms) alternatives to
fossil fuels have yet been discovered. Global oil, gas,
and coal reserves are finite but sufficient to support yet
another technology leap. Further prospects look vague
and require efforts in areas such as prospecting, the development of mining technologies, and more efficient
use of resources (not resource saving, but more efficient generation). Even the development of existing reserves can promote technological transformations. At
the same time, the application of these resources can
potentially transform the entire technological chain.
For example, completely replacing internal combustion cars by electric vehicles while continuing to use
coal as the main energy source would look nothing but
hypocritical to future generations.
The sustainable development concept insists on abandoning conventional resources in favor of more expensive and less efficient alternatives. Perhaps David
Graber is right calling to put an end to the dominance
of bureaucracy, which not only consumes a significant
portion of the added value created by productive labor,

but also imposes its own image of the future, which at
some point can diverge from the interests of the rest of
humanity [Graeber, 2018].
***
The issue of supporting humanity’s long-term development by providing an adequate supply of necessary
energy resources is critical at present. No solution
that is even remotely unambiguous and generally accepted exists today for the conflict between environmental considerations and increased energy consumption, which lays fertile ground for speculations about

the end of the fossil fuel era. Environment protection
should not get in the way of the development of human civilization, which shows no inclination towards
downshifting. It would not be right to hail the consumerist side of human nature, but it is exactly what
encourages people to make discoveries, explore new
lands, and even advance to outer space. The laws of
social and economic development occasionally do put
humans in their place, curbing their limitless aspirations, but deluding ourselves with the prospects of an
ecological utopia while trying to harness them could
be much more dangerous.
