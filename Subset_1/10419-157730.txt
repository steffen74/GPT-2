
1 Introduction
One way to keep track of the progress of logistics and
supply chain management (SCM) discipline is to analyze
the doctoral dissertations within the research area. By
reviewing such dissertations, it will be possible to gain
some interesting information regarding the development
and direction of research within the discipline. Speciﬁcally,
such a review will help us to understand the different
approaches in relation to research framework, methodologies, theories applied and the empirical interpretations.
Furthermore, the review could not only provide valuable
insights into potential research gaps within the discipline,
but also pave way for recognizing interesting topics for
future research [13, 41]. Besides, given that PhD students
are likely to form the next generation of established
researchers, research conducted by them is important to the
SCM discipline as it helps keeping the discipline on track
with emerging topics as well as stimulate theory
generation.
The number of PhD students in the Nordic countries has
increased signiﬁcantly during the last decades [24, 41].
Based on the rise in the number of dissertations as well as
their varying content, it is interesting to investigate the
requirements that are part of completing a PhD dissertation.
There has been an escalation in dissertations that are based
on collections of articles instead of a monograph [41]. A
reason for this might be an increasing pressure to publish at
the universities [21], which might be driving PhD students
to learn and master the craft of publishing from the very
start of their career. No matter what, the culture of many
research departments is characterized by a high focus on
performance in terms of publications in ranked journals [2,
20, 22, 27]. Therefore, by choosing an article-based dissertation, PhD students might have a better opportunity to
work together with other PhD students and senior
researchers; in doing so, they also learn how to ‘‘play the
game.’’
The ﬁrst two comprehensive digest of doctoral dissertations completed within the Nordic countries was

what has been researched within the logistics and SCM
area. These studies have also facilitated the comparison of
Nordic dissertations themes to those in the USA (e.g.,
compiled by Stock [31] and Nakhata et al. [25]). Prior
research has demonstrated that much confusion exists
concerning SCM deﬁnitions and its overlap with logistics
[32]. This paper extends the work of Zachariassen and
´
Arlbjørn [41] that applies what Halldorsson et al. [14] call
a relabeling approach between the terms of logistics and
SCM. The purpose of this paper is to document the progress of doctoral work in logistics and SCM within the
Nordic countries between 2009 and 2014. In all, 120 relevant dissertations were identiﬁed; however, we were
unable to retrieve eight dissertations either in physical form
or electronically; therefore, only 112 dissertations were
reviewed. With a point of departure within the dimensions
and classiﬁed categories of these two above-mentioned
reviews, this paper provides two analyses:
1.
2.

An analysis of identiﬁed Nordic dissertations from the
year 2009–2014; and
A longitudinal analysis that compares the above
analysis with the result from Gubi et al. [13] and
Zachariassen and Arlbjørn [41].

Accordingly, the analyses within this paper will not only
reveal several important insights, but also identify new,
potential research areas within the logistics and SCM discipline. Based on these insights, it will be possible to
coordinate future research efforts and avoid any unnecessary replication or duplication of previous work.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2
provides a brief literature review of earlier contributions
dealing with doctoral dissertation reviews. Section 3 discusses the methodology used in this study; it also outlines
the limitations concerning the chosen methodology. Subsequently, Sect. 4 discusses the results obtained from
analyzing the Nordic dissertations. Finally, Sect. 5 concludes with the overall purpose of the paper and some
directions for future research activities.

2 Extant literature on doctoral dissertations
in logistics and supply chain management
Several authors have analyzed and classiﬁed doctoral dissertations in logistics and SCM, both within the Nordic
countries as well as the USA. In this section, nine prior
studies—seven American studies and two Nordic studies—
are brieﬂy mentioned so as to identify the trends in topical
coverage through the years and to see whether there are any

123



similarities between the topics chosen by PhD students
across the Atlantic.
The ﬁrst study of compendiums of PhD research in
logistics conducted by Stock back in 1987 [28] examined
684 dissertations from the period 1970–1986 [29]. Subsequent reviews were conducted in (1) 1993 covering 422
American dissertations that were completed in the period of
1987–1991 [34] and (2) 2001 with an analysis of 317 PhD
dissertations completed in the period of 1992–1998 [31]. In
2006, Stock completed his fourth review of PhD dissertations together with Broadus [33]. This study showed a
distinct increasing trend in the number of dissertations
within SCM- and/or logistic-related areas in the period from
1999 to 2004 when compared to the period covered by the
2001 study. But surprisingly, the count between 1999 and
2004 fell short of the overall levels of 1987–1991. A more
interesting ﬁnding of the 2006 study was that the dissertations were more multifaceted due to the fact that they closely mirrored the cross-functional and boundary spanning
nature of logistics; at the same time, their multifaceted
nature made the classiﬁcation task more difﬁcult.
Another American study was conducted by Das and
Handﬁeld [8] wherein the authors investigated 117 PhD
dissertations from the period 1987–1995 in order to evaluate the intellectual health of the purchasing discipline.
The study was an extension of a previous research on
purchasing dissertations conducted by Williams [39] to
identify the key focus areas of research in the prior decade.
In this study, Williams concluded that the key focus areas
covered were supplier selection and development, information systems, organizational and measurement issues,
negotiation and purchasing ethics.
The most recent review covering US dissertations was
conducted by Nakhata et al. [25]. In this study, the authors
reviewed 609 doctoral dissertations completed between
2005 and 2009. The number of identiﬁed dissertations in
this study is signiﬁcantly larger than the four reviews
conducted by Stock and colleagues and clearly reﬂects a
signiﬁcant increase in colleges/universities graduating
doctoral students within logistics- and supply chain-related
areas. Nakhata et al. [25] also point out that a forthcoming
retirement of academic ‘‘baby boomers’’ during the period
2005–2020 may explain the increase in the PhD production. The most prominent research methodologies
employed by doctoral students in the study of Nakhata
et al. [25] are modeling, simulation and empirical quantitative methods.
Two earlier studies of Nordic doctoral dissertations
within logistics and SCM have been disseminated in academic journals. The ﬁrst was developed by Gubi et al. [13],
who reviewed 71 Nordic dissertations published between
1990 and 2001. Most of the dissertations were published as
by Zachariassen and Arlbjørn [41] wherein the authors
analyze the development in Nordic doctoral research in
logistics and SCM from the years 2002–2008. As opposed
to Gubi et al. [13], Zachariassen and Arlbjørn [41] found
more dissertations based on a collection of articles, which
was reﬂective of a response to increase publication pressure. In contrast to the Gubi et al.’s [13] study, the primarily entity of analysis of most dissertations was the
manufacturing companies. While prior reviews showed a
focal company perspective, the review of Zachariassen and
Arlbjørn [41] documented a shift toward an inter-organizational perspective covering dyadic and supply chain units
of analysis. Additionally, according to Zachariassen and
Arlbjørn [41], there has also been a decreased focus on the
philosophy of science, since most dissertations were being
published as collections of articles.

3 Method
The method applied for identifying, collecting and
reviewing the doctoral dissertations in this paper follows a
three-step process. These steps are explained in the following subsections.
3.1 Identifying and collecting Nordic doctoral
dissertations
The ﬁrst step consisted of sending e-mails to contact persons at different research institutions within the Nordic
countries (i.e., Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and
Sweden) as outlined in [41]. Based on this e-mail contact,
the list was further modiﬁed (e.g., adding University of
¨
Vaasa in Finland and Linnaeus University and Orebro
University School of Business in Sweden). The ﬁnal list
included 39 research institutions which are presented in
‘‘Appendix 1.’’ A contact person at each of the 39 research
institution was identiﬁed and was contacted by e-mail. The
e-mail provided a clear statement of the research project
and requested the list of completed doctoral dissertations
within logistics and SCM within the analysis period. This
process provided an initial list of 120 dissertations.
Majority of these dissertations were accessible in electronic
form (we either received them by e-mail or downloaded
them from the corresponding institution’s Web site). The
rest of the dissertations were available in hard copy form.
3.2 Validating the initial list of doctoral
dissertations
The second step was concerned with the validation of the
identiﬁed dissertations by senior researchers from each of

Page 3 of 18 5

the Nordic countries. This step was completed by e-mailing
the initial list to these senior researchers and by attending
the 27th annual NOFOMA conference in June 2015 at
Molde University College. This process resulted in the
inclusion of an additional 41 dissertations, thereby
increasing the total count to 161.
3.3 Reviewing the received dissertations
In the third step, a detailed review of the 161 dissertations
took place. During this process, three dissertations were
excluded since they were judged as not being within the
scope of the present analysis. Out of this net list of 158, it
was possible to conduct reviews of 150 dissertations. As
mentioned earlier, we were unable to retrieve eight dissertations as well as there was no response from the authors
when we e-mailed them requesting for the copy of their
dissertation. A complete list of the dissertations is included
in ‘‘Appendix 2.’’ The detailed review took place against a
review framework as described in [13, 41]. Our analysis
covered additional review elements as the dissertations
were mostly based on a collection of articles. These elements were: (1) number of articles, (2) type of article
(journal publication, book chapter, conference paper,
working paper or unpublished paper), (3) year of publication, (4) ranking of the journal, (5) number of authors on
each article and (6) the doctoral candidate’s author number
for the speciﬁc article.
3.4 Limitations
This dissertation review has some limitations that are
worthwhile to mention. First, even though the gross list of
dissertations was reviewed and validated by senior
researchers within the Nordic countries, there is a possibility that some dissertations were not identiﬁed. Second,
reviewer subjectivity could not be completely eliminated in
the review of the 150 dissertations. However, in order to
minimize subjectivity, an aligned interpretation of the
review elements and their outcome was obtained by a
common review of three different types of dissertations
(one monograph and two article-based dissertations).
Third, the list of dissertations that was composed and
reviewed stems from the NOFOMA research community.
Obviously, other Nordic researchers may produce doctoral
dissertations that deal with topics under the scope of this
review, but is outside the NOFOMA radar (e.g., researchers
belonging to European Decision Sciences Institute (EDSI),
European Logistics Association (ELA), European Operations Management (EurOMA), International Purchasing
and Supply Education and Research Association (IPSERA)
or Logistics Research Network (LRN) or Rencontres
Internationales de Recherche en Logistique (RIRL)

only based on the dissertations reviewed under the
NOFOMA umbrella. Fourth, since the contact persons
were not provided with a deﬁnition of logistics and SCM,
they might have excluded some dissertation that could have
fallen within the scope of this analysis. Moreover, the
senior researchers whom we e-mailed for dissertations
might not be from the department of logistics and SCM.
Therefore, including deﬁnitions for logistics and SCM will
have no impact.

4 Analysis
This section is concerned with speciﬁc analyses of the 150
reviewed doctoral dissertations. For comparative purposes,
the data from the present review are portrayed and analyzed with the categories that are similar to those used by
Gubi et al. [13] and Zachariassen and Arlbjørn [41]. The
results are displayed in tables and are followed with
appropriate comments and interpretations.
4.1 Number and type of dissertations ﬁnalized
in the period 2009–2014
Table 1 contains the PhD dissertations divided by country,
year of publication and type of dissertation (monograph vs.
a collection of articles). Compared with the earlier studies,
these new ﬁgures show some interesting developments.
First, the number of ﬁnalized dissertations in the period
2009–2014 is 158, which represents an average of 26 dissertations per year. Compared with averages numbers of 10
(from the period 2002–2008) and 6.25 (from the period
1990–2001), this shows that there has been a strong increase
in PhD production in this research area. A similar pattern is
identiﬁed by Nakhata et al. [25] in their study of doctoral
dissertations published by Dissertation Abstracts International in the period of 2005 and 2009. They explain that one
reason for such an increase might be an increased level of
retiring academicians toward 2020 which creates a stronger
market for Assistant Professors. Another explanation could
be that there is a drive from the governments to boost the
number of annual PhD production in order to support
national social, economic and environmental well-being as
well as to address major global challenges [12]. The
majority of the Nordic logistics and SCM PhDs come from
the Finnish, Norwegian and Swedish research environments. In Denmark, the production is stable with 17 dissertations in the period of 2009–2014. Iceland has reported
their ﬁrst PhD in this period of analysis. Twenty-ﬁve Nordic
research institutions have produced within logistics and
SCM in the period 2009–2014 (see ‘‘Appendix 2’’).

123



Another interesting ﬁnding in the current review is the
increase in the share of dissertations that are based on a
collection of articles. As given in Table 1, 92 out of the 150
dissertations (61 %) are based on a collection of articles.
Thus, there is a much higher focus on the craft to write
academic articles when compared to the share of articlebased dissertations in previous periods (29 % in the period
2002–2008 and 21 % in the period 1990–2001). This trend
supports the predictions previously made by Zachariassen
and Arlbjørn [41]. One plausible explanation for this
development might be an increased amount of public and
private resource allocation to research environments based
on publications in internationally recognized peer-reviewed journals as well as measures such as impact indicators and H-index (see, e.g., [27]).
4.2 Primary entity of analysis
In Table 2, all 150 dissertations are classiﬁed according to
their entity of analysis; the classiﬁcations are also compared to previous results reported in [13, 14]. The study of
the primary entity of analysis in the dissertations shows
strong differences. First, the category others has increased
to about one-third of the dissertations in the last reported
period. This group consists of a variety of dissertations
without a speciﬁc supply chain actors’ perspective—such
as fresh ﬁsh supply chains [26] and healthcare logistics
[17]. Second, in absolute numbers, the manufacturer as the
primary entity of analysis has increased when compared to
the previous studies; but, if we measure the number as a
percentage of the reviewed dissertations, there is a fall
from 57 % in the dissertations from 2002 to 2008 to 33 %
in the recent study.
Thus, it shows the more classical actors such as
wholesalers, retailers and inventory hotels have obtained
lesser research focus. Additionally, a remarkably low
number of dissertations have focused on retail SCM within
the Nordic countries. This is intriguing given the fact that
the retail sector is well known for supply chain innovations
such as quick response systems, efﬁcient consumer
response, distribution centers, reverse logistics, as well as
collaborative planning, forecasting and replenishment [10].
4.3 Level of analysis arranged according to year
of publication
Table 3 shows the analysis of the dissertations level of
analysis arranged by the year of publication.
An interesting development evidenced in the above
table is an increased focus on functional themes within
dissertations (in the present analysis, this is about 26 % of
the dissertations compared with 11 and 10 % in previous

Comparable data are included from the period 1990–2001 (Gubi et al. [13]) and 2002–2008 (Zachariassen and Arlbjørn [41])

dissertations and can indicate an emphasis on building
stronger knowledge bases in certain sub-disciplines along
the supply chain. Examples of such dissertations are [18,
19]. Another interesting development is the reduced focus
on ﬁrm-level analysis and a subsequent increased focus on
the supply chain or the network as the level of analysis,
with the network level experiencing the highest increase.
This increase is strongly evident within Swedish
dissertations.
4.4 Research design, time frame and philosophy
of science
Table 4 shows the classiﬁcation of the dissertations
according to research design, time frame and philosophy of

science. The recent analysis reveals a decrease in share of
dissertations that are purely theoretical in nature. Also, the
share of dissertations founded on purely qualitative methods has also decreased compared with dissertations published in the period 2002–2008. The drop in share of these
two categories has attributed to increases in shares of dissertations based on quantitative methods and on triangulations of qualitative and quantitative research methods.
The increase in quantitative research methods can be
explained by the increased pressure to publish, thereby
favoring quantitative methods over time-consuming qualitative studies (see, e.g., [21]). While quantitative data
collection can be automated, it is not possible for qualitative data collection. Qualitative data collection is, in general, more time-consuming and expensive when compared

Containing philosophy

to quantitative research studies. Thus, it might be more
cost-effective to slice one questionnaire survey into a
number of articles than doing the same number of articles
based on qualitative methodologies. This trend will

123

undoubtedly improve numerical performance metrics. At
the same time, this trend need not necessarily deliver new
knowledge that could move the discipline signiﬁcantly

more in-depth interaction of this issues and method
considerations, (3) there is a lower prioritization of philosophy of science due to higher pressure from external
funded projects that do not demand this theme, and (4)
logistics and SCM are closely connected with industry
that could lead to a perception that philosophy of science
is less relevant. To this list, we add four more potential
reasons. First, there are no requirements mentioned in
Nordic countries’ ministerial orders granting degrees of
PhD about unfolding philosophical of science perspectives. Second, few, if any, journals within logistics and
SCM demand such discussions. Third, philosophy of
science has disappeared from PhD candidates’ syllabi.
Finally, only a few PhD advisors have the knowledge to
join in such discussions with their PhD students; therefore, they do not send signals for offering such courses.
Overall, this development is inexpedient if the discipline
really has to move toward theory development [6, 30].

the phenomenon of ‘‘salami-slicing’’ where the data from a
particular project are disseminated in a number of articles
that in fact are ‘‘sliced’’ so thinly that there might be
overlap of the papers (e.g., text recycling in literature
review sections, key ﬁndings and discussions ([9, 16]). We
refer to the Committee on Publication Ethics (COPE) [7]
for a discussion on different forms of text recycling.
Table 4 also shows an increased share of dissertations
that apply a longitudinal perspective. Additionally, the
share of snapshot time frames has decreased and the
share of the category time frame not speciﬁed has
increased. Examples of dissertations without any speciﬁc
time frame are by (1) Mortensen [23], who investigate
the concept of attraction and explain its role in initiation
and development of buyer–seller relations, and (2) Tyn¨¨
jala [35], who conceptually examines the methods and
tools for supply chain decision making during new product development. A ﬁnal remarkable ﬁnding from
Table 4 is the continued decline of dissertations containing philosophy of science issues. The present analysis
identiﬁes 73 % of the dissertations not including such
philosophical considerations in comparison with 71 and
45 % in the two previous periods of analysis. Twentynine percent of dissertations that are monographs do
contain philosophy of science considerations, whereas
25 % have this content among the article-based dissertations. Zachariassen and Arlbjørn [41] provided four
possible reasons for this decline: (1) There are no
mandatory requirements for PhD students to attend philosophy of science courses, (2) article-based dissertations
do not rely on philosophy of science argumentations to
the same degree as the monographs that typically require

Table 5 displays the dissertations according to topic groups
based on a title analysis of the 158 identiﬁed dissertations.
For comparison reasons, the topic groups identiﬁed in
previous studies were used [13, 41] and further supplemented with two new groups risk management and
humanitarian logistics. The table shows a continued decline
in the share of dissertations related to system design/
structure/effectiveness, organizational development/competencies and material handling. In contrast, topics related

transport/transport systems have obtained increased
awareness. The increase in these topics is primarily based
on Swedish and Norwegian dissertations.
Additionally, while the study by [41] found that topics
related to humanitarian logistics and risk management were
absent, the present review of dissertations has remedied
this with dissertations on this topic from Finland and
Sweden.
4.6 Article-based dissertations
The study reported in this paper reveals an increased
amount of article-based dissertations. This development
conﬁrms the expectations raised by Zachariassen and Arlbjørn [41]. However, an article-based dissertation can be
composed in different ways—e.g., with respect to
requirements regarding the type of articles, number of
articles, co-author permission and the author order position
among the co-authors in an article. The ministerial orders
granting the degree of PhDs in the different countries do
not provide any guidance and requirements concerning the
format of a PhD. This opens up for various interpretations
of the required workload to earn the PhD degree. Therefore, the increase in more article-based dissertations
requires that we study how the practice of these types of
dissertations is unfolded in the Nordic countries. This
section takes a closer look at the 92 article-based dissertations and develops a measure to differentiate the various
types of dissertations. The subsequent subsection proposes
a measure for article-based dissertation; this measure is
subsequently used in analyzing the identiﬁed Nordic article-based dissertations.

Table 6 Authorship factor
calculation

4.6.1 Measure for dissertation score
In order to develop a measure for an average article-based
dissertation, we ﬁrst need to recognize the fact that a
speciﬁc article that is part of the dissertation can take
different forms. Hence, the ﬁrst element in this proposal for
a dissertation measure is to differentiate between the different types of contributions that are part of the articlebased dissertation and then to allocate different scores for
the different types. The present analysis distinguishes
between ﬁve different types of articles with speciﬁc scores
as follows:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.

Peer-reviewed journal articles, score: 1
Peer-reviewed articles in form of book chapters (e.g.,
in an anthology), score: 0.8
Peer-reviewed conference articles, score: 0.8
Working papers, score: 0.5
Non-published papers, score: 0.5

The differences in scores are used to reﬂect different
perceptions of workload as well as quality requirements.
Thus, a peer-reviewed journal article obtains the highest
score of 1 point followed by book chapters and conferences
papers with scores of 0.8, and working papers and nonpublished manuscripts of 0.5 points.
The next step in developing a dissertation score is to
propose a measure that takes into account the number of
authors as well as the order of the authors. Thus, a sole
authored paper by a PhD candidate counts more than a coauthored paper. And, in the present measure, a ﬁrst-order
author position counts more than a lower author position.

various numbers of authors and author order positions.
Based on the above proposals of different types of
articles and measures for different authorship indicators,
we can now develop an overall dissertation score based on
Formula 1:
Formula 1: overall dissertation score
n
X
S¼
Ti Ã Authorship factori
i¼1

where S = overall dissertation score, T = type of article
and authorship factor = number of authors (NoA) * author
order position (AOP).
The overall dissertation score is composed of multiplying the scores of the individual articles by the authorship factor. The basic idea is that the highest score per
article of 1 point is reduced based on the lower the level of
the perceived status of various channels (e.g., journal
rankings; journal articles versus book chapters; conference
articles versus journal articles/book chapters) and the
number of co-authors as well as the author order the PhD
student has for the given article. A conference paper that is
included in an article-based dissertation, which have been
through a double-blind review process (e.g., at a
NOFOMA, LRN or a EurOMA conference), is valued 0.8
compared with an article that is published in a peer-reviewed journal. Thus, a conference article is considered as
less mature when compared to an article that has been
through perhaps several revisions in a journal before
acceptance. However, we should avoid with the generalization of the different channels. The Danish Bibliometric
Research Indicator, for example, value accepted conference articles as much as some journal papers, if they are
accepted to be presented at some conferences (e.g.,
EURAM and AOM) [36]. Also, contributions to books are
valued differently according to which publisher the work is
published with [37].
The dissertation score is a measure for the PhD dissertation at hand—and thus, the status of it when it was judged
and passed. Several article-based dissertations contain nonpublished papers, working papers and conference articles
that ﬁnd its way to peer-reviewed journals after the degree
of PhD has been awarded and further workload is invested
in those articles. Other articles of this nature never end in
publications for various reasons. Thus, the status of the
papers after the PhD evaluation is not included in the
dissertation score presented in this article.
An article-based dissertation is evaluated not only on the
enclosed articles, but also on the text (the frame) that bind
the articles together. Also, herein there seems to be different practices—e.g., the scope and depths on positioning
the thesis against extant research; the level and scope of

Page 9 of 18 5

methodological and philosophy of science discussions (see,
e.g., [3]); independent literature reviews as well as discussions on the ‘‘red line’’ between the included articles.
The overall purpose with the dissertation score is to
propose a measure to be used for discussing the scope and
content-type of a PhD dissertation. What is enough? And
how much of a dissertation can be co-authored with others?
Is one dissertation better than another because it includes
articles that are published? It is our experience that there
are differences in what is needed in an article-based dissertation both within a department at a research institution
and between research institutions. The present dissertation
score can help in discussing what is needed and also in
developing department guidelines.
The proposed overall dissertation score formula is not
without limitations. First, the division of types of articles
and their scores is subjective. The peer-reviewed journal
category, for example, can be further divided into different
scores by following speciﬁc journal ranking lists. Second,
the scores for various numbers of authors and their author
order position in the proposed authorship factor calculation are also subjective and can be altered. The order of
authors of a paper does not necessarily display the true
workload of different authors. The order of authors can be
organized using different principles such as a simple
alphabetical listing, organized after seniority (experience);
listing the person ﬁrst who got the idea to the article as the
ﬁrst author; or listing PhD students ﬁrst because they need
the credit more than their senior co-authors. Third, the
dissertation score does not include a time perspective (i.e.,
the length of the PhD program)—a higher score can be
obtained over a 5-year period when compared to a 3-year
period. Fourth, the dissertation score does not take into
consideration the extent of thesis frame (the text accompanying the articles such as scoping, positioning, methods,
philosophy of science, contribution and implications).
Fifth, the score of author order position decreases based on
the position; this may not reﬂect the actual work load. In
summary, as with any measures in general, this overall
dissertation score also has its own shortcomings and these
are important to be considered to ensure the practical use
of the score. However, in spite of the sometime magical
status of numbers—we should remember that ‘‘numbers
are just number’’ and that they can be used to jump start
discussions on how to compose an article-based
dissertation.

Danish, 27 Finnish, 37 Swedish and 16 Norwegian dissertations. As given in Table 7, the dissertations vary in the
number of included articles spanning from three to eight
articles. The majority of the dissertations are composed of
four to six articles. The average number of articles counts
to 4.84. Table 7 also shows that the average dissertation
score increases from 1.53 with three articles to 5.38 with
eight articles. This is not surprising given the design of the
formula.
Furthermore, Table 7 shows that including journal articles is a well-established practice among the reviewed
dissertations. The share of journal articles counts 54 %
among dissertations with four articles (71/132); 62 %
among dissertations with ﬁve articles (80/130); and 69 %
among dissertations with six articles (99/144). After journal papers, conference papers and non-published papers are
the second most typical types that are included in article-

123

based dissertations. Finally, Table 7 shows that including
reviewed books chapters is not that prevalent among the
dissertations reviewed.
This review also shows that there are more PhD candidates at Chalmers University of Technology with highest
number of contributions at 18 dissertations followed by
Molde University College with 16 dissertations and Lund
University with 11 dissertations (see Fig. 1). In all, the 92
article-based dissertations contain 446 articles divided into
the ﬁve types discussed in Sect. 4.6.1. Out of this, 266 are
peer-reviewed journal articles of which 68 are from Chalmers University of Technology; 39 are from Molde
University College; and 39 are from Lappeenranta
University of Technology. In total, 83 articles are included
as conference papers; 64 are included as non-published
papers; 27 are included as working papers; and only six

Number of arƟcle-based dissertaƟons per insƟtuƟon

Figure 1 demonstrates a relatively high variety among
the dissertations across the different research institutions
with respect to the average institutional dissertations
(ranging from 1.47, 2.47, 2.76, 2.96, 3.03, 3.12, 3.22, 3.25,
3.45, 3.83, 3.87, 3.93, 4.11, 4.22, 4.28, 5.02). Four of the
six dissertations composed of three articles (see Table 7)
are Danish dissertations from Aarhus School of Business/
Aarhus University. In contrast, eight out of the 24 dissertations holding six articles are composed of 4–6 peer-reviewed journal articles. The dissertation score is here
suggested as an instrument that can be used in discussions
on what is required to earn the degree of PhD at the speciﬁc
research institutions and, through benchmarks, facilitate
alignment processes if needed. With the limitations in
mind, a PhD student can discuss with her or his advisor(s) as of what type of articles are required; whether coauthored articles with advisors or other senior researchers
or PhD students can be included; and how a PhD student
documents her or his contribution in each article if they are
co-authored. The dissertation score can also stimulate
further discussions on what should be included in the
binder of the dissertation—e.g., prioritizes theme to be
discussed in the binder instead of adding another article.
4.7 Potential topics for inclusion in the dissertations
The review process of the 150 dissertations reveals that ﬁve
research areas seem to be under-prioritized among Nordic
scholars within logistics and SCM. The topics are as follows (not prioritized):
(1)

Cloud technology Although there is a focus on
maximizing the effectiveness of shared resources [5],

(2)

(3)

(4)

the increased availability of high-capacity network,
low-cost computers and storage devices as well as the
widespread adoption of hardware virtualization,
service-oriented architecture, and autonomic and
utility computing have led to a growth in the use of
cloud technology. In spite of its increased importance, it is distinct that this subject has not received
more attention in the dissertations reviewed.
Globalization of SC As mentioned previously, this
topic was still largely ignored in the dissertation
reviewed. With the natural outcome of expanding
growing market and sustaining competitive advantage, companies have to make key decisions about
managing costs and complexity through globalized
supply chain (see, e.g., [11]).
Supply chain innovation (SCI) The discipline of
innovations has branched out into the supply chain
context and should be regarded as an important topic.
While ﬁrms are applying their assets, operating
resources and capabilities to develop new ways of
improve performance, they cannot ignore the importance of their supply chain partners in enabling product
and process innovations (see, e.g., [1]). Accordingly,
more attention needs to be paid to this topic.
Security This topic was also mentioned in the
previous study by Zachariassen and Arlbjørn [41].
Yet, this topic has only received limited attention
among the 112 dissertations published between 2009
and 2014. Security is increasingly becoming a major
concern to both private and public sector organizations. Security searches for cooperative arrangements between businesses as well as identiﬁes risks


before the goods move. It is also concerned with
controlling theft and reducing illegal import and
export of stolen goods. There are many areas of
research within the topic of security from formal
aspects to empirical research (see, e.g., [4, 40]).
Hence, it is essential that researchers start focusing
on the different aspects of this topic in the future.
This is one of the key topics of research within
supply chain now as well as in the distant future.
Big data This is currently drowning the world. The
huge amount of data is an invaluable asset in the
context of supply chains. The quality of the evidence
extracted signiﬁcantly beneﬁts from the availability
of broad datasets. On the one hand, extensive vision
is more promising when extra data are available.
And, on the other hand, it is a big challenge. The
current approach is not appropriate to handle large
data, and therefore, there is a need for new solutions
to handle large datasets. This research ﬁeld is new
and rapidly evolving [38], and there is also a leadtime issue before we see the ﬁrst dissertations within
this area. As a result, any initial effort taken will be a
strong contribution from both experimental and
theoretical perspective (see, e.g., [15]).

5 Conclusion
This paper has set out to analyze the development of
Nordic doctoral dissertations in logistics and SCM from the
years 2009–2014. The paper identiﬁed 158 dissertations
relevant for review; out of this, 150 dissertations were
reviewed in depth based on different criteria. Compared
with previous studies, this research found several important
developments in Nordic doctoral research. First, there has
been an increase in the average annual number of ﬁnalized
dissertations when compared to previous Nordic studies.
The results predominantly show the remarkable increase in
dissertations between 2009 and 2014 (158 dissertations)
wherein Sweden ranks highest followed by Finland, Norway, Denmark and Iceland, respectively. Second, there has
been a decrease in dissertations that focus on classical
entities of analysis such as carriers, wholesalers, retailers
and inventories. Therefore, it is clear that the PhD dissertation’s focal point is still more on manufacturing ﬁrms
(50/150) rather than on other entities. Third, there has been
an increase in functional subject areas of logistics and SCM
and the supply chain/network level. Fourth, the number of
dissertations containing philosophy of science discussions
is continuing to decline. As mentioned earlier, there is a
signiﬁcant increase in article-based dissertations and these
dissertations do not adopt philosophy of science; as a

123



result, there is an extreme decrease (110/150). Finally,
there is clear shift toward disseminating doctoral research
as an article-based dissertation (2009–2014: 92/150;
2002–2008: 26/70; 1990–2001: 15/71, respectively).
However, this piece of research has demonstrated that the
content of the Nordic article-based dissertations varies
along dimensions such as types of articles included, the
number of articles included and the number of co-authors
at the papers. A dissertation score has been suggested as a
measure for initiating discussions about such dissertations
at a single research institution and as a benchmark between
different institutions. As discussed earlier, such a score is
not without limitations and must not stand alone. Therefore, the next logical step might be to discuss how far
should we go with the number and the type of contributions. What is enough in order to earn a PhD degree? The
content of this paper can be used to match the expectations
of PhD students and their supervisors so as to ﬁnd the right
path to learn the craft of conducting and disseminating
logistics and SCM research.
