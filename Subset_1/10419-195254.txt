Argentina has always been considered a basket case. No better proof of this fact
than the name of this collection which refers to Argentina’s exceptionalism, thus
assuming that there is something unusual, ‘‘exceptional’’, for good or bad, regarding
Argentina’s economic performance.
It is a well-known fact that at the turn of the XXth century, Argentina was among
the richest countries in the world1 and that after WWII started a long period of
economic decline.2 While by the turn of the XXIst century, Argentina still was, in
PPP terms, the richest among large Latin American countries, and it had lost
signiﬁcant ground relative to its peer group of a century ago. This long stagnation
has become to some an apparently unavoidable fate, only to be interrupted
occasionally by brief growth spurts that inevitably provided the stage for the
following crisis (a process that has been dubbed ‘‘stop go’’ dynamics).3 In fact,
studies about the Argentine perception of the business cycle indicate that Argentines
tend to become pessimists in the midst of each economic boom as if anticipating the
unavoidable next crisis (see Gabrielli and Rouillet 2003).
This stagnation and perennial process of going forward and backwards has
permeated not only the economic sphere, but has also been relevant in politics, as
Argentina witnessed a string of military interventions between 1930 and 1983. It
is perhaps in this parallel dimension, where Argentines feel that real progress has
been made since 1983, as nowadays, there is virtually no possibility of an
interruption of the democratic political process. However, has this improvement in
the political sphere been matched by a similar success in economic performance?
Not in the collective imagination. Since the return of democracy, the country has
experienced two hyperinﬂations, several defaults and restructurings of its debt,
many large devaluations, periods of persistent high inﬂation, deﬂation, introduction of parallel currencies, and deep economic crises. This poor economic
performance has implied a volatile evolution of its per capita GDP growth and a
deteriorating income distribution, as shown in Fig. 1. It is the long period between
the 70s and the ﬁrst decade of the 21st century that has built the belief of a
stagnant economy. Taking 1983, the year of the restoration of democracy, as a
starting point, output per capita has grown only 1.5% when considering the period
until 2009. However, the per capita income of 1983, with ups and downs, was left
behind only in 2002–2003. The per capita income of 1980 was left behind only in
2005, i.e., 25 years later.

Gerchunoff and Llach (2003a, 2003b and 2004) have studied in detail this phenomenon, as well as other
papers in this special collection (Llach; Glaeser and Campante; and Alvaredo, Cruces and Gasparini).
Many of these authors found that Argentina was less developed in terms of education, health, inequality
and other determinants of growth than countries with similar levels of product.

All the historical literature accepts this perspective as given,4 providing a
cohesive and unanimous answer to the question about economic performance:
Argentina’s exceptional bad performance since democracy is considered a stylized
fact.
The purpose of this paper is to challenge this view. In fact, we want to challenge
the view that economic performance during Argentina’s recent democracy has been
dismal, both in terms of earnings growth as well as in terms of income distribution.
Using the shift in the Engel curves to re-estimate the relevant price levels, we will
argue that real earning growth has been steady and much bigger than measured and
that income distribution has improved. If we are able to convince our readers of our
results, our work would throw a completely new light on recent economic
performance. Under this new light, the exceptionalism that has been the focus of the
other papers in this special collection would appear to have been left behind already
two decades ago. With commodity prices on a relatively strong footing, a region
that appears to be increasingly in order, and large wealth increases from the
development of mining, agricultural, and energy resources, the prospect for
Argentina looks bright in the foreseeable future.

There are many articles that analyze the performance of Argentina during this period. See for example
Damill and Frenkel (1992 and 2003), Damill et al. (2002), Gerchunoff and Llach (2003a) for output
performance and its determinants. For papers specially focused on income distribution and its
determinants see Altimir and Beccaria (2001), Altimir et al. (2002), Gasparini (2005), Lindenboim et al.
methodology to correct the bias in the price levels typically used to estimate real
income growth; section results shows the estimation results; and the last section
provides some ﬁnal thoughts. Our conclusions are that Argentina’s exceptionalism
is a presumption that still needs to be proven and that Argentina’s economic
performance during our recent democracy, both in terms of income distribution and
earnings growth, has been substantially better than accepted in the economic debate.

2 Methodology
It is standard to use income as the most relevant measure to estimate well-being.
However, to obtain a comparable measure of income over time, it is necessary to
deﬂate the nominal measures at each speciﬁc moment by a price series, most
commonly the consumer price index (CPI). In the case of Argentina, in particular,
the one used is that corresponding to the city of Buenos Aires and its metropolitan
area. This a Laspeyres type index, with a ﬁxed basket, and subject to a series of
well-known biases.5
First, these indexes overestimate inﬂation, because they omit the effect of
substitution between goods, changes in quality of the goods, and the impact of the
availability of new products. Second, the use of a common price index may be a
problem when building measures of income distribution, because it assumes that
baskets are equivalent across all income groups.
In Argentina, consumption surveys are not very frequent. The last three were
conducted in 1984–1985, 1996–1997, and 2004–2005, and where undertaken to
update the basket in the CPI. However, the large time gap between updates may lead
to signiﬁcant biases, particularly if we consider the large structural changes
undergone by the Argentina economy over the last 25 years (e.g., a large trade
liberalization process).6 Thus, correcting for the biases produced in the CPI can
change the evolution of real income, and correcting for the biases at different income
levels can also change the evolution of income distribution during this period.7
These consumption surveys can be used to estimate the biases following the
methodology of Costa (2001) and Hamilton (2001). In a nutshell, the methodology
uses the assumption that Engel curves for food should be relatively stable. If this is
the case, when the estimation of the Engel curves at different dates shows shifts, it is
assumed that these correspond to CPI bias. To illustrate the point, consider two
points in time between which the share of food in income declines with a stagnant
earnings level. Under the assumption that the Engel curve is stable, this provides a
presumption that CPI may be biased (overestimated in this case) as a falling income
share is consistent with rising, not stagnant, income levels. Thus, the changes in the

Diewert et al. (2009) summarize the main developments of this literature and how they impacted on
methodological changes in the US.

6

In many countries these surveys are annual, and basket revisions are done at higher frequencies.

7

This adjustment occurs by allowing an adjustment in household income by a speciﬁc index that
in the Engel curve are obtained after correcting for changes in relative prices and
household characteristics.
In later work, Carvalho Filho and Chamon (2012) use semi-parametric models to
extend the methodology to estimate the biases at different income levels, thus
allowing to tackle the issue of income distribution.
We should clarify that in the previous work, identiﬁcation was built from
exploiting the differences across regions. In the case of Argentina, however, our
data contained only one area (the metropolitan area of the city of Buenos Aires).
Thus, our paper needs to innovate from a methodological point of view relative to
the previous work, by ﬁnding a way to obtain identiﬁcation when only data from
one region are available, something we do using individual price indexes by
household.
2.1 Estimating CPI biases

equation:

where wijt is the ratio of food to non-food of household i, in region j at time t; PFjt is
the true unobservable price of food in region j at time t; PNjt is the true and
unobservable price of non-food in region j at time t; Yijt is nominal income for
household i, in region j at time t; PGjt is the true and unobservable general price
level in region j at time t; Xijt is a set of control variables for household i, in region
j at time t; lijtQ a random term; and /, c, b, and the different hx are parameters.

If we call: Gjt is the cumulative percentage growth of the observable CPI in
Q
region j, since time 0 and time t; Fjt is the cumulative percentage growth of the
Q
price of food, in region j, between time 0 and time t; Njt is the cumulative
percentage growth of the price of non-food, in region j, between time 0 and time t;
EGjt is the cumulative percentage increase in the measurement error in the CPI in
region j, between time 0 and time t; EFjt is the cumulative percentage increase in the
measurement error in the price of food, in region j, between time 0 and time t; and
ENjt is the cumulative percentage increase in the measurement error in the price of
non-food, in region j, between time 0 and time t.We can rewrite (1) as

Notice that dt is a function only of time. If we additionally assume that the biases for
food and non-food items are similar, we can compute a measure of the general CPI
bias from

From (6), we can compute EGt ¼ eÀ b À 1 which is the measurement error between
real inﬂation and CPI inﬂation. - EGt is the cumulative bias.The assumption that
the bias for food and non-food are the same is not necessarily very realistic.
However, under reasonable assumptions, our measure can be considered a lower
bound for the estimate. From (5)

If food is a basic good with an income elasticity less than one (b \ 0) and if the
income effect is larger than substitution effect for food consumption (c \ 0),8 and
under the reasonable assumption that the mismeasurement in non-food is larger than
in food products, the ﬁrst term in (7) is negative and our bias can be considered a
lower bound. In other words, our measure would be underestimating the bias in the
CPI.
So far, we have just described the estimation methodology used in the previous
works. However, due to data limitations, we need to introduce some changes in the
estimation procedure. Argentina has relatively few consumption expenditures that
are publicly available and, as we mentioned above, we only had access to the
Survey of Household Expenditures of 1985/1986 (Encuesta de Gasto de los Hogares
1985/86, EGH85/86), the National Survey of Household Expenditures 1996/1997
(Encuesta Nacional de Gasto de los Hogares 1996/97, ENGH 96/97), and National
Survey of Household Expenditures 2004/2005 (Encuesta Nacional de Gasto de los
Hogares 2004/05, ENGH 04/05). The EGH 85/86 took place in the city of Buenos
Aires and its metropolitan area. For the ENGH 2004/05, we only have data for the
city of Buenos Aires.
As a result, our data include only two regions, and thus, Eq. (3) becomes

where Dj equals one for households belonging to the city of Buenos Aires.
In the literature, identiﬁcation is obtained from regional variations, and thus, PFjt
is the food price in region j, and PGjt is the general price index in region j. This gives
several observations for each moment in time allowing estimating the coefﬁcient on
the time dummy. Unfortunately, we cannot follow this procedure here, because we
only have price indexes for the entire sample (Buenos Aires and its metropolitan
area). Even if we would have the regional price indexes, that of only two neighbor
regions is clearly not good enough to identify the price relative effect and time
dummy.
Fortunately, while the speciﬁcation assumes two types of goods, food and nonfood, in reality, there are many goods within each of those categories. In the data, it
is not feasible to compute a family speciﬁc food price index, but this is feasible for
the non-food bundle. Thus, we construct a relative price between the food and nonfood baskets at the household level. More precisely, we have that

kik Pkt

ð9Þ
ð10Þ

k

where kik is the ratio of expenditure in item k over overall spending on non-food
items, for household i at time t.
Considering that kik can be estimated from the individual data from the surveys,
we can now rewrite (3) as

where ( Nit ) is the cumulative percentage growth of the price of non-food between
time 0 and time t at the household level. This equation provides the estimates, as
shown in Table 3.
A consequence of this strategy, however, is that the price index estimated at the
family level may be correlated with the error term of the equation, and may pose an
endogeneity problem, for example, if this price level is correlated with the taste for
food. To deal with this problem, an alternative is to assign an arbitrary value for c

Q ÁÃ
Q Á
and then compute wijt À c ln 1 þ Ft À ln 1 þ Nt as the dependent variable to
estimate the bias. This circumvents the need to use the individual price level
altogether. However, where could we take this coefﬁcient from? If we use the
is to use an exogenous measure of this coefﬁcient. Costa (2001) obtains a coefﬁcient
of 0.046 for the United States when identifying the effect of relative prices from
differences in regions. Repeating the exercise with 0.046, the cumulative bias
reaches 59.4%. Using twice the coefﬁcient for the United States (0.092), the
cumulative bias reaches 58.9%. The main reason why changes in the c coefﬁcient
do not signiﬁcantly alter the results is that relative prices have not changed too
much. Figure 2 shows the evolution of the relative price of food in terms of the
general level between 1985 and 2005.
Because the price of food in terms of the CPI has fallen about 10% between the
ﬁrst and second surveys, and only 4% between the ﬁrst and the third, to signiﬁcantly
alter the results, the coefﬁcient should be extremely large. For example, to reduce
the cumulative bias to half (i.e., to about 30%), the coefﬁcient should be more than
40 times the estimated coefﬁcient for United States. In short, our results appear to
be extremely robust, independently of the methodology adopted.
Trebon (2008) has suggested that economies of scale in each household may
affect the share of food to non-food and suggests a correction based on introducing
the household size interacted with the time dummies (that identify the bias). In other
words, he suggests estimating

While Trebon ﬁnds that this correction reduced CPI biases by as much as a half
relative to the ﬁndings in Costa (2001) and Hamilton (2001) for the US, Sect. 3
shows that in our case, this correction does not change things.

Following Carvalho Filho y Chamon (2012), we explore also the possibility that the
amount of bias may change along the Engel curve thus allowing estimating different
mismeasurements in earnings growth for different income levels. Using a semiparametric speciﬁcation and assuming, as before, that the biases are the same for the
food and non-food bundles, we have that

To estimate the cumulative bias for households at time t, we went through the

f0 near the value estimated for each household at time t (that is ft ). In fact, we

from households at time 0. Fourth, we computed the real income from household in
time t that it should have as per its share of food, adding to the income of lower (in

terms of f ) the difference computed before. Fifth, we computed the bias from
household i at time t, using the real income from household at time t, and the real
income that it should as per its share of food. More precisely, what we do is to

3 Results
3.1 Data
As we mentioned above, Argentina has relatively few consumption expenditures
that are publicly available. Thus, we only had access to the Survey of Household
Expenditures of 1985/1986 (Encuesta de Gasto de los Hogares 1985/86, EGH85/
86), the National Survey of Household Expenditures 1996/1997 (Encuesta Nacional
de Gasto de los Hogares 1996/97, ENGH 96/97), and the National Survey of
Household Expenditures 2004/2005 (Encuesta Nacional de Gasto de los Hogares
2004/05, ENGH 04/05). The EGH 85/86 took place in the city of Buenos Aires and
its metropolitan area. For the ENGH 2004/05, we only have data for the city of
Buenos Aires.
We start our analysis of this data in Fig. 3, with a brief illustration of some basic
statistics for the three household surveys. There, we show expenditure shares on
different types of goods as a function of income levels. Each curve depicts one the
three surveys for which we have data.
Some straightforward conclusions may be inferred from the ﬁgure. First, the
relation between food and income is negative, indicating that food is a basic good.
More so, not only can we see that the share of food falls systematically as we move
upwards in income, but that the shares fall for each later survey. To the extent that
Engel curves are stable, this would clearly indicate that income levels increased
uninterruptedly throughout the period. With the exception of housing, the shares of
the remaining composite goods tend to increase with income. For a nonArgentinean, perhaps, it is surprising how much Education expenditures increase
with income, a result that originates on the much higher use of private education
among higher income levels.
To check the consistency and quality of the data, Table 1 shows the main
demographic characteristics for each survey. The table shows that the data are fairly
homogenous, but that over the period of the three surveys, Argentina has
experienced a reduction in household size, a larger share of females in the labor
force, and an increase in the number of single parents’ households.
To compare the nominal variables, we use the CPI to bring them to a comparable
basis (in the table, all prices are expressed in 1999 pesos). The table shows that,
according to the data, income levels decrease quite sizably between the 85/86 wave
and the 96/97 sample. Notice that during the same period (see Fig. 3), there is an
unambiguous decline in the share of food for all income groups. It is this

incomes increase, while the food share continues to decline, so at this stage, it is
unclear whether a bias exists or not.
Table 2 shows that data for the city of Buenos Aires only provide an even more
striking ﬁnding: household income has fallen throughout in spite of declining food
shares.
3.2 Estimating biases
To estimate the bias in CPI measurement, we use Eq. (11) which allows to estimate
the magnitude (as well as the statistical signiﬁcance) of the bias. The results are
shown in Table 3.
Columns (1) and (4) use expenditures as a proxy for permanent income. Columns
(2) and (5) use current income. Columns (3) and (6) use current income as an
instrument for expenditure. The second set of regressions adds a number of
additional control variables.
The table shows that if we compare the 85/86–96/97 periods, we see similar
measure biases across the estimations, with a cumulative bias of the order of
between 58 and 65%. The large bias indicates an overestimation of the CPI of a
whopping range between 7.5 and 9.2% per year. Considering that it is likely that the
bias may not have occurred uniformly across years, this suggests a massive
overestimation in particular years. On the contrary, when comparing the 96/97 and
04/05 periods, we ﬁnd a relatively small bias, which is also, typically, not
signiﬁcant.
Considering the whole sample and spanning the entire democratic period, we ﬁnd
an average bias of between 4.3 and 5.7%, indicating that real earnings may have
grown by this additional amount during the period, similar to the numbers found for
Brazil and much larger than the numbers found for the US.
The fact that the overestimation of the CPI takes place in the ﬁrst part of the
sample has to do, in our view, with the massive change occurred in Argentina as a
result of the opening up of the economy in the late 80 s and early 90 s. While this
time dimension will have to be tested and evaluated in future work, we present here
an ‘‘illustration’’ of the effect by showing the change in varieties of commercial
retailing in Argentina between the 1980s and the 1990s. In the 1980s, varieties were
minimal and the quality relatively poor. We believe that visualizing the difference
may help in understanding the magnitude of the potential gain. Figure 4 shows three
pictures. One corresponds to the typical grocery store in the 1980s. The shelves
show how limited the variety offered was. The two other pictures show a
minimarket and a large chain store supermarket (‘‘hipermercado’’, as is known in
Argentina) in the 2000s. While the change depicts the food component, similar
changes were observed throughout this period across all consumption baskets.
One potential criticism of our results is that the food item is composed of
products consumed both inside and outside the household. Since goods consumed
outside home may include some service component and thus not be entirely subject

The result of this more ﬂexible estimation procedure, shown in Figs. 5 and 6,
conﬁrms that, in fact, the biases are dramatically different across income levels,
being much larger at lower income levels, as shown by the much larger movement
in the curve at the lower part of the scale. Figure 5 shows the estimated Engel
curves in log terms, whereas Fig. 6 relates the bias to income levels directly.
This result is similar to the one obtained by Carvalho Filho and Chamon (2012)
for Brazil.
As we mention in the methodological section, once we compute the bias at
different income levels, we can estimate an adjusted income (see Eq. 15). Table 6
shows the basic statistics for the bias in real income measures, at each income level,

On average, the bias estimated is fairly similar, though somewhat larger, to that
obtained in Tables 3, 4, and 5. However, as can be seen in Table 6, this average
hides a large heterogeneity across income levels.
Once we compute the bias, we can correct individual income levels using
individual biases. Thus, we re-estimate the corrected income using the formula:
RYÃit ¼

RYit
ð1 þ Eit Þ

Yit
Q is the real income, and RYÃit is the bias-corrected real
ð1þ Gt Þ
income.While we can compute Eit only for the common support area,9 we use the

where RYit ¼

This procedure can underestimate the effect of bias correction in incomes because we have seen that
the bias is decreasing in income. However, there are only a few observations outside the common support
area, so we do not expect this to change the results in any signiﬁcant way.

real purchasing power shows a signiﬁcant increase in average real expenditure and
income.
Figure 8 shows the Gini coefﬁcients both for the ofﬁcial numbers and for those
computed using the corrected real income numbers. Again, we take as benchmark
the 85–86 values. It is important to notice that we are not making a statement on the
actual level of inequality (had we taken the 2005–2006 period as benchmark, the
corrected value of the Gini would have coincided with the ofﬁcial numbers for these
years), but we are making a statement on the fact that during the 85–2006 period, we
ﬁnd a sizable reduction in income inequality in Argentina, which, again, contrasts
starkly with ofﬁcial ﬁgures.
Figure 9 shows Lorenz Curves and the bias-corrected versions for the 1996/1997
(left column) period and the 2004/2005 (right column) period, both for income (ﬁrst
row) and expenditures (second row). We can see that bias-corrected curves strictly
dominate not corrected curves, so we can reproduce the same results of Fig. 9 using
any inequality index.
To complete this presentation of our ﬁndings, Fig. 10 mimics the same graphs,
but for the distribution of income and expenditure levels (left and right columns,
respectively), comparing the original data with the bias-corrected data (upper and
lower rows, respectively).

4 Conclusions
This paper has estimated the CPI measurement bias for Argentina during its recent
democratic period. While we use a methodology that unveils the bias from the
inconsistencies between the assumption of stable Engel curves and the evolution of
the share of food in expenditures, we innovate in that we obtain identiﬁcation from
individual differences in the consumption bundles and price indexes at the
household level, thus being able to estimate the bias with data from only one region,

The ﬁndings are striking. Argentina’s democracy has experienced a larger (much
larger) raise in real expenditure levels than previously thought, and has improved its
income distribution.
The bias in expenditure levels arises primarily between 84/85 and 96/97. It is
difﬁcult with further data to estimate when the bias may be originating. The years
84/85 were a time of very high inﬂation; thus, the data may be underestimating the
level of regressivity in the income distribution those years. In addition, the late 80s
and early 90s showed a period of signiﬁcant opening up of the economy that led to a
signiﬁcant increase in income levels. Because openness comes with large changes in
the quantity and quality of available products, it is not surprising that during this
period, we may have experienced substantial increases in economic well-being not
fully reﬂected in the standard statistics.
The second period is a bit more puzzling. While the data suggest an
overestimation of the CPI, the level of this overestimation appears to be small.
However, the bias in income distribution appears to be larger. This is puzzling,
because the later period sees a rising inﬂation, indicating, a priori, that there should
be deterioration in the income distribution levels.
All in all, our conclusion, however, is that Argentina’s democracy has allowed for a

Abstract We use the shifts in Engel curves calculated from household surveys to
estimate CPI biases in Argentina between 1985 and 2005. We ﬁnd that real earning
levels increased during this period between 4.3 and 5.7% faster per year than
previously estimated. More surprisingly, relative to conventional wisdom, that
income distribution has improved throughout this period.

Argentina has always been considered a basket case. No better proof of this fact
than the name of this collection which refers to Argentina’s exceptionalism, thus
assuming that there is something unusual, ‘‘exceptional’’, for good or bad, regarding
Argentina’s economic performance.
It is a well-known fact that at the turn of the XXth century, Argentina was among
the richest countries in the world1 and that after WWII started a long period of
economic decline.2 While by the turn of the XXIst century, Argentina still was, in
PPP terms, the richest among large Latin American countries, and it had lost
signiﬁcant ground relative to its peer group of a century ago. This long stagnation
has become to some an apparently unavoidable fate, only to be interrupted
occasionally by brief growth spurts that inevitably provided the stage for the
following crisis (a process that has been dubbed ‘‘stop go’’ dynamics).3 In fact,
studies about the Argentine perception of the business cycle indicate that Argentines
tend to become pessimists in the midst of each economic boom as if anticipating the
unavoidable next crisis (see Gabrielli and Rouillet 2003).
This stagnation and perennial process of going forward and backwards has
permeated not only the economic sphere, but has also been relevant in politics, as
Argentina witnessed a string of military interventions between 1930 and 1983. It
is perhaps in this parallel dimension, where Argentines feel that real progress has
been made since 1983, as nowadays, there is virtually no possibility of an
interruption of the democratic political process. However, has this improvement in
the political sphere been matched by a similar success in economic performance?
Not in the collective imagination. Since the return of democracy, the country has
experienced two hyperinﬂations, several defaults and restructurings of its debt,
many large devaluations, periods of persistent high inﬂation, deﬂation, introduction of parallel currencies, and deep economic crises. This poor economic
performance has implied a volatile evolution of its per capita GDP growth and a
deteriorating income distribution, as shown in Fig. 1. It is the long period between
the 70s and the ﬁrst decade of the 21st century that has built the belief of a
stagnant economy. Taking 1983, the year of the restoration of democracy, as a
starting point, output per capita has grown only 1.5% when considering the period
until 2009. However, the per capita income of 1983, with ups and downs, was left
behind only in 2002–2003. The per capita income of 1980 was left behind only in
2005, i.e., 25 years later.

Gerchunoff and Llach (2003a, 2003b and 2004) have studied in detail this phenomenon, as well as other

Many of these authors found that Argentina was less developed in terms of education, health, inequality
and other determinants of growth than countries with similar levels of product.

All the historical literature accepts this perspective as given,4 providing a
cohesive and unanimous answer to the question about economic performance:
Argentina’s exceptional bad performance since democracy is considered a stylized
fact.
The purpose of this paper is to challenge this view. In fact, we want to challenge
the view that economic performance during Argentina’s recent democracy has been
dismal, both in terms of earnings growth as well as in terms of income distribution.
Using the shift in the Engel curves to re-estimate the relevant price levels, we will
argue that real earning growth has been steady and much bigger than measured and
that income distribution has improved. If we are able to convince our readers of our
results, our work would throw a completely new light on recent economic
performance. Under this new light, the exceptionalism that has been the focus of the
other papers in this special collection would appear to have been left behind already
two decades ago. With commodity prices on a relatively strong footing, a region
that appears to be increasingly in order, and large wealth increases from the
development of mining, agricultural, and energy resources, the prospect for
Argentina looks bright in the foreseeable future.

There are many articles that analyze the performance of Argentina during this period. See for example
Damill and Frenkel (1992 and 2003), Damill et al. (2002), Gerchunoff and Llach (2003a) for output
performance and its determinants. For papers specially focused on income distribution and its
determinants see Altimir and Beccaria (2001), Altimir et al. (2002), Gasparini (2005), Lindenboim et al.
methodology to correct the bias in the price levels typically used to estimate real
income growth; section results shows the estimation results; and the last section
provides some ﬁnal thoughts. Our conclusions are that Argentina’s exceptionalism
is a presumption that still needs to be proven and that Argentina’s economic
performance during our recent democracy, both in terms of income distribution and
earnings growth, has been substantially better than accepted in the economic debate.

2 Methodology
It is standard to use income as the most relevant measure to estimate well-being.
However, to obtain a comparable measure of income over time, it is necessary to
deﬂate the nominal measures at each speciﬁc moment by a price series, most
commonly the consumer price index (CPI). In the case of Argentina, in particular,
the one used is that corresponding to the city of Buenos Aires and its metropolitan
area. This a Laspeyres type index, with a ﬁxed basket, and subject to a series of
well-known biases.5
First, these indexes overestimate inﬂation, because they omit the effect of
substitution between goods, changes in quality of the goods, and the impact of the
availability of new products. Second, the use of a common price index may be a
problem when building measures of income distribution, because it assumes that
baskets are equivalent across all income groups.
In Argentina, consumption surveys are not very frequent. The last three were
conducted in 1984–1985, 1996–1997, and 2004–2005, and where undertaken to
update the basket in the CPI. However, the large time gap between updates may lead
to signiﬁcant biases, particularly if we consider the large structural changes
undergone by the Argentina economy over the last 25 years (e.g., a large trade
liberalization process).6 Thus, correcting for the biases produced in the CPI can
change the evolution of real income, and correcting for the biases at different income
levels can also change the evolution of income distribution during this period.7
These consumption surveys can be used to estimate the biases following the
methodology of Costa (2001) and Hamilton (2001). In a nutshell, the methodology
uses the assumption that Engel curves for food should be relatively stable. If this is
the case, when the estimation of the Engel curves at different dates shows shifts, it is
assumed that these correspond to CPI bias. To illustrate the point, consider two
points in time between which the share of food in income declines with a stagnant
earnings level. Under the assumption that the Engel curve is stable, this provides a
presumption that CPI may be biased (overestimated in this case) as a falling income
share is consistent with rising, not stagnant, income levels. Thus, the changes in the
5

Diewert et al. (2009) summarize the main developments of this literature and how they impacted on
methodological changes in the US.

6

In many countries these surveys are annual, and basket revisions are done at higher frequencies.

7

This adjustment occurs by allowing an adjustment in household income by a speciﬁc index that
in the Engel curve are obtained after correcting for changes in relative prices and
household characteristics.
In later work, Carvalho Filho and Chamon (2012) use semi-parametric models to
extend the methodology to estimate the biases at different income levels, thus
allowing to tackle the issue of income distribution.
We should clarify that in the previous work, identiﬁcation was built from
exploiting the differences across regions. In the case of Argentina, however, our
data contained only one area (the metropolitan area of the city of Buenos Aires).
Thus, our paper needs to innovate from a methodological point of view relative to
the previous work, by ﬁnding a way to obtain identiﬁcation when only data from
one region are available, something we do using individual price indexes by
household.
2.1 Estimating CPI biases

where wijt is the ratio of food to non-food of household i, in region j at time t; PFjt is
the true unobservable price of food in region j at time t; PNjt is the true and
unobservable price of non-food in region j at time t; Yijt is nominal income for
household i, in region j at time t; PGjt is the true and unobservable general price
level in region j at time t; Xijt is a set of control variables for household i, in region
j at time t; lijtQ a random term; and /, c, b, and the different hx are parameters.

Q
region j, since time 0 and time t; Fjt is the cumulative percentage growth of the
Q
price of food, in region j, between time 0 and time t; Njt is the cumulative
percentage growth of the price of non-food, in region j, between time 0 and time t;
EGjt is the cumulative percentage increase in the measurement error in the CPI in
region j, between time 0 and time t; EFjt is the cumulative percentage increase in the
measurement error in the price of food, in region j, between time 0 and time t; and
ENjt is the cumulative percentage increase in the measurement error in the price of
non-food, in region j, between time 0 and time t.We can rewrite (1) as

Notice that dt is a function only of time. If we additionally assume that the biases for
food and non-food items are similar, we can compute a measure of the general CPI
bias from

From (6), we can compute EGt ¼ eÀ b À 1 which is the measurement error between
real inﬂation and CPI inﬂation. - EGt is the cumulative bias.The assumption that
the bias for food and non-food are the same is not necessarily very realistic.
However, under reasonable assumptions, our measure can be considered a lower
bound for the estimate. From (5)

If food is a basic good with an income elasticity less than one (b \ 0) and if the
income effect is larger than substitution effect for food consumption (c \ 0),8 and
under the reasonable assumption that the mismeasurement in non-food is larger than
in food products, the ﬁrst term in (7) is negative and our bias can be considered a
lower bound. In other words, our measure would be underestimating the bias in the
CPI.
So far, we have just described the estimation methodology used in the previous
works. However, due to data limitations, we need to introduce some changes in the
estimation procedure. Argentina has relatively few consumption expenditures that
are publicly available and, as we mentioned above, we only had access to the
Survey of Household Expenditures of 1985/1986 (Encuesta de Gasto de los Hogares
1985/86, EGH85/86), the National Survey of Household Expenditures 1996/1997
(Encuesta Nacional de Gasto de los Hogares 1996/97, ENGH 96/97), and National
Survey of Household Expenditures 2004/2005 (Encuesta Nacional de Gasto de los
Hogares 2004/05, ENGH 04/05). The EGH 85/86 took place in the city of Buenos
Aires and its metropolitan area. For the ENGH 2004/05, we only have data for the
city of Buenos Aires.
As a result, our data include only two regions, and thus, Eq. (3) becomes

where Dj equals one for households belonging to the city of Buenos Aires.
In the literature, identiﬁcation is obtained from regional variations, and thus, PFjt
is the food price in region j, and PGjt is the general price index in region j. This gives
several observations for each moment in time allowing estimating the coefﬁcient on
the time dummy. Unfortunately, we cannot follow this procedure here, because we
only have price indexes for the entire sample (Buenos Aires and its metropolitan
area). Even if we would have the regional price indexes, that of only two neighbor
regions is clearly not good enough to identify the price relative effect and time
dummy.
Fortunately, while the speciﬁcation assumes two types of goods, food and nonfood, in reality, there are many goods within each of those categories. In the data, it
is not feasible to compute a family speciﬁc food price index, but this is feasible for
the non-food bundle. Thus, we construct a relative price between the food and nonfood baskets at the household level. More precisely, we have that

kik Pkt

ð9Þ
ð10Þ

k

where kik is the ratio of expenditure in item k over overall spending on non-food
items, for household i at time t.
Considering that kik can be estimated from the individual data from the surveys,
we can now rewrite (3) as

where ( Nit ) is the cumulative percentage growth of the price of non-food between
time 0 and time t at the household level. This equation provides the estimates, as
shown in Table 3.
A consequence of this strategy, however, is that the price index estimated at the
family level may be correlated with the error term of the equation, and may pose an
endogeneity problem, for example, if this price level is correlated with the taste for
food. To deal with this problem, an alternative is to assign an arbitrary value for c

Q ÁÃ
Q Á
and then compute wijt À c ln 1 þ Ft À ln 1 þ Nt as the dependent variable to
estimate the bias. This circumvents the need to use the individual price level
altogether. However, where could we take this coefﬁcient from? If we use the
is to use an exogenous measure of this coefﬁcient. Costa (2001) obtains a coefﬁcient
of 0.046 for the United States when identifying the effect of relative prices from
differences in regions. Repeating the exercise with 0.046, the cumulative bias
reaches 59.4%. Using twice the coefﬁcient for the United States (0.092), the
cumulative bias reaches 58.9%. The main reason why changes in the c coefﬁcient
do not signiﬁcantly alter the results is that relative prices have not changed too
much. Figure 2 shows the evolution of the relative price of food in terms of the
general level between 1985 and 2005.
Because the price of food in terms of the CPI has fallen about 10% between the
ﬁrst and second surveys, and only 4% between the ﬁrst and the third, to signiﬁcantly
alter the results, the coefﬁcient should be extremely large. For example, to reduce
the cumulative bias to half (i.e., to about 30%), the coefﬁcient should be more than
40 times the estimated coefﬁcient for United States. In short, our results appear to
be extremely robust, independently of the methodology adopted.
Trebon (2008) has suggested that economies of scale in each household may
affect the share of food to non-food and suggests a correction based on introducing
the household size interacted with the time dummies (that identify the bias). In other
words, he suggests estimating

While Trebon ﬁnds that this correction reduced CPI biases by as much as a half
relative to the ﬁndings in Costa (2001) and Hamilton (2001) for the US, Sect. 3
shows that in our case, this correction does not change things.

Following Carvalho Filho y Chamon (2012), we explore also the possibility that the
amount of bias may change along the Engel curve thus allowing estimating different
mismeasurements in earnings growth for different income levels. Using a semiparametric speciﬁcation and assuming, as before, that the biases are the same for the
food and non-food bundles, we have that

To estimate the cumulative bias for households at time t, we went through the
following steps. First, we selected the real income of households at time 0 that had

f0 near the value estimated for each household at time t (that is ft ). In fact, we
selected two incomes at time 0 for each household at time t (those with income that

difference in real income between the two selected households. Third, we
distributed linearly the difference according to the number of households from

from households at time 0. Fourth, we computed the real income from household in
time t that it should have as per its share of food, adding to the income of lower (in

terms of f ) the difference computed before. Fifth, we computed the bias from
household i at time t, using the real income from household at time t, and the real
income that it should as per its share of food. More precisely, what we do is to

3 Results
3.1 Data
As we mentioned above, Argentina has relatively few consumption expenditures
that are publicly available. Thus, we only had access to the Survey of Household
Expenditures of 1985/1986 (Encuesta de Gasto de los Hogares 1985/86, EGH85/
86), the National Survey of Household Expenditures 1996/1997 (Encuesta Nacional
de Gasto de los Hogares 1996/97, ENGH 96/97), and the National Survey of
Household Expenditures 2004/2005 (Encuesta Nacional de Gasto de los Hogares
2004/05, ENGH 04/05). The EGH 85/86 took place in the city of Buenos Aires and
its metropolitan area. For the ENGH 2004/05, we only have data for the city of
Buenos Aires.
We start our analysis of this data in Fig. 3, with a brief illustration of some basic
statistics for the three household surveys. There, we show expenditure shares on
different types of goods as a function of income levels. Each curve depicts one the
three surveys for which we have data.
Some straightforward conclusions may be inferred from the ﬁgure. First, the
relation between food and income is negative, indicating that food is a basic good.
More so, not only can we see that the share of food falls systematically as we move
upwards in income, but that the shares fall for each later survey. To the extent that
Engel curves are stable, this would clearly indicate that income levels increased
uninterruptedly throughout the period. With the exception of housing, the shares of
the remaining composite goods tend to increase with income. For a nonArgentinean, perhaps, it is surprising how much Education expenditures increase
with income, a result that originates on the much higher use of private education
among higher income levels.
To check the consistency and quality of the data, Table 1 shows the main
demographic characteristics for each survey. The table shows that the data are fairly
homogenous, but that over the period of the three surveys, Argentina has
experienced a reduction in household size, a larger share of females in the labor
force, and an increase in the number of single parents’ households.
To compare the nominal variables, we use the CPI to bring them to a comparable
basis (in the table, all prices are expressed in 1999 pesos). The table shows that,
according to the data, income levels decrease quite sizably between the 85/86 wave
and the 96/97 sample. Notice that during the same period (see Fig. 3), there is an
unambiguous decline in the share of food for all income groups. It is this

Lat Am Econ Rev (2018)27:8
incomes increase, while the food share continues to decline, so at this stage, it is
unclear whether a bias exists or not.
Table 2 shows that data for the city of Buenos Aires only provide an even more
striking ﬁnding: household income has fallen throughout in spite of declining food
shares.
3.2 Estimating biases
To estimate the bias in CPI measurement, we use Eq. (11) which allows to estimate
the magnitude (as well as the statistical signiﬁcance) of the bias. The results are
shown in Table 3.
Columns (1) and (4) use expenditures as a proxy for permanent income. Columns
(2) and (5) use current income. Columns (3) and (6) use current income as an
instrument for expenditure. The second set of regressions adds a number of
additional control variables.
The table shows that if we compare the 85/86–96/97 periods, we see similar
measure biases across the estimations, with a cumulative bias of the order of
between 58 and 65%. The large bias indicates an overestimation of the CPI of a
whopping range between 7.5 and 9.2% per year. Considering that it is likely that the
bias may not have occurred uniformly across years, this suggests a massive
overestimation in particular years. On the contrary, when comparing the 96/97 and
04/05 periods, we ﬁnd a relatively small bias, which is also, typically, not
signiﬁcant.
Considering the whole sample and spanning the entire democratic period, we ﬁnd
an average bias of between 4.3 and 5.7%, indicating that real earnings may have
grown by this additional amount during the period, similar to the numbers found for
Brazil and much larger than the numbers found for the US.
The fact that the overestimation of the CPI takes place in the ﬁrst part of the
sample has to do, in our view, with the massive change occurred in Argentina as a
result of the opening up of the economy in the late 80 s and early 90 s. While this
time dimension will have to be tested and evaluated in future work, we present here
an ‘‘illustration’’ of the effect by showing the change in varieties of commercial
retailing in Argentina between the 1980s and the 1990s. In the 1980s, varieties were
minimal and the quality relatively poor. We believe that visualizing the difference
may help in understanding the magnitude of the potential gain. Figure 4 shows three
pictures. One corresponds to the typical grocery store in the 1980s. The shelves
show how limited the variety offered was. The two other pictures show a
minimarket and a large chain store supermarket (‘‘hipermercado’’, as is known in
Argentina) in the 2000s. While the change depicts the food component, similar
changes were observed throughout this period across all consumption baskets.
One potential criticism of our results is that the food item is composed of
products consumed both inside and outside the household. Since goods consumed
outside home may include some service component and thus not be entirely subject

The result of this more ﬂexible estimation procedure, shown in Figs. 5 and 6,
conﬁrms that, in fact, the biases are dramatically different across income levels,
being much larger at lower income levels, as shown by the much larger movement
in the curve at the lower part of the scale. Figure 5 shows the estimated Engel
curves in log terms, whereas Fig. 6 relates the bias to income levels directly.
This result is similar to the one obtained by Carvalho Filho and Chamon (2012)
for Brazil.
As we mention in the methodological section, once we compute the bias at
different income levels, we can estimate an adjusted income (see Eq. 15). Table 6
shows the basic statistics for the bias in real income measures, at each income level,

On average, the bias estimated is fairly similar, though somewhat larger, to that
obtained in Tables 3, 4, and 5. However, as can be seen in Table 6, this average
hides a large heterogeneity across income levels.
Once we compute the bias, we can correct individual income levels using
individual biases. Thus, we re-estimate the corrected income using the formula:
RYÃit ¼

RYit
ð1 þ Eit Þ

Yit
Q is the real income, and RYÃit is the bias-corrected real
ð1þ Gt Þ
income.While we can compute Eit only for the common support area,9 we use the

where RYit ¼

This procedure can underestimate the effect of bias correction in incomes because we have seen that
the bias is decreasing in income. However, there are only a few observations outside the common support
area, so we do not expect this to change the results in any signiﬁcant way.

real purchasing power shows a signiﬁcant increase in average real expenditure and
income.
Figure 8 shows the Gini coefﬁcients both for the ofﬁcial numbers and for those
computed using the corrected real income numbers. Again, we take as benchmark
the 85–86 values. It is important to notice that we are not making a statement on the
actual level of inequality (had we taken the 2005–2006 period as benchmark, the
corrected value of the Gini would have coincided with the ofﬁcial numbers for these
years), but we are making a statement on the fact that during the 85–2006 period, we
ﬁnd a sizable reduction in income inequality in Argentina, which, again, contrasts
starkly with ofﬁcial ﬁgures.
Figure 9 shows Lorenz Curves and the bias-corrected versions for the 1996/1997
(left column) period and the 2004/2005 (right column) period, both for income (ﬁrst
row) and expenditures (second row). We can see that bias-corrected curves strictly
dominate not corrected curves, so we can reproduce the same results of Fig. 9 using
any inequality index.
To complete this presentation of our ﬁndings, Fig. 10 mimics the same graphs,
but for the distribution of income and expenditure levels (left and right columns,
respectively), comparing the original data with the bias-corrected data (upper and
lower rows, respectively).

4 Conclusions
This paper has estimated the CPI measurement bias for Argentina during its recent
democratic period. While we use a methodology that unveils the bias from the
inconsistencies between the assumption of stable Engel curves and the evolution of
the share of food in expenditures, we innovate in that we obtain identiﬁcation from
individual differences in the consumption bundles and price indexes at the
household level, thus being able to estimate the bias with data from only one region,

The ﬁndings are striking. Argentina’s democracy has experienced a larger (much
larger) raise in real expenditure levels than previously thought, and has improved its
income distribution.
The bias in expenditure levels arises primarily between 84/85 and 96/97. It is
difﬁcult with further data to estimate when the bias may be originating. The years
84/85 were a time of very high inﬂation; thus, the data may be underestimating the
level of regressivity in the income distribution those years. In addition, the late 80s
and early 90s showed a period of signiﬁcant opening up of the economy that led to a
signiﬁcant increase in income levels. Because openness comes with large changes in
the quantity and quality of available products, it is not surprising that during this
period, we may have experienced substantial increases in economic well-being not
fully reﬂected in the standard statistics.
The second period is a bit more puzzling. While the data suggest an
overestimation of the CPI, the level of this overestimation appears to be small.
However, the bias in income distribution appears to be larger. This is puzzling,
because the later period sees a rising inﬂation, indicating, a priori, that there should
be deterioration in the income distribution levels.
All in all, our conclusion, however, is that Argentina’s democracy has allowed for a

Appendix A: The data
To run our estimations, we use the individual data points for the (EGH 85/68),
(ENGH 96/97), and (ENGH 04/05) constructed by the Instituto Nacional de
´
Estadısticas y Censos (INDEC). The EGH 85/86 covers only the city of Buenos
Aires and its metropolitan area. As a result, we only considered the same region for
the ENGH 96/97. For the ENGH 04/05, we only had access to the data for the city of
Buenos Aires. This appears to have no fundamental effect on our estimations.
Running all the estimates just for data from the city of Buenos Aires gives virtually
identical results.
4907 years 2841 households each,12 reporting income and expenditures (itemized
by groups) as well as the typical demographic characteristics.
Because the INDEC does not provide information about inconsistent observations in the survey, we keep out of the analysis a few observations that seem to be
inconsistent in expenditure. We take out households that:
–
–
–

Do not report total expenditure or report a negative value (1 in EGH 85/86, 6 in
ENGH 96/97 and 10 in ENGH 04/05).
Report a very low total expenditure (lower than 100 pesos of 1999) and a share
of food lower than 50% (19 in ENGH 96/97 and 3 in ENGH 04/05).
Do not report expenditures in food (26 in EGH 85/86, 49 in ENGH 96/97 and 31
in ENGH 04/05).

In addition, we found 58 households in ENGH 96/97 and 93 households in ENGH
04/05, with negative consumption in at least one expenditure group. We have set at
zero the level corresponding to negative expenditure.
Needless to say, these obvious mistakes are numerically insigniﬁcant, and do not
change the main results.
In the ENGH 96/97 and the ENGH 04/05, there is information about households
with imputed income and expenditure,13 but not in the EGH 85/86, as a
consequence. we will assume that the imputation method used by the INDEC is
valid and similar across surveys.
The EGH 85/86 was conducted between July 1985 and June 1986. The base
indicates the quarter in which each household has been surveyed. Based on this
information, we have paired the data with the corresponding CPI level (and its
categories) corresponding to the average for each quarter.
ENGH 96/97 took place between February 1996 and March 1997, but numbers
have been taken nominal values relative to the average CPI during the period, as
there is no information as to the speciﬁc quarter in which the survey was conducted.
Fortunately, this is a very low inﬂation period, and therefore, whatever mistake
arises from this must necessarily be minimal.14
ENGH 04/05 took place between October 2004 and December 2005. The base
indicates the quarter in which each household was surveyed, and therefore, the
procedure followed is similar that used for EGH 85/86.

See Tables 7, 8, 9, and 10.

These numbers correspond only to households from Buenos Aires and its Metropolitan Area, and to
the city of Buenos Aires in the last sample.
13
26.8% of incomes in Buenos Aires and its Metropolitan Area are imputed in ENGH 96/97, 28.1% of
incomes and 26.4% of expenditures in Buenos Aires are totally or partially imputed in ENGH 04/05.
