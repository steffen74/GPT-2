With varying degrees of intensity, each of us is marked by a large and complex process of
confrontation, identification, assessment and action (Paton, 2004, p. 39), which generates the
need for permanent improvement of their performance and also creating new opportunities
capable of producing change. In this context, the dynamism and richness of a country depends
on the competitiveness of business and organizational performance which, in turn, rely on the
entrepreneurial capacities proven through skills and innovative initiatives capable of generating
national wealth. As a direct result of the development of desire to succeed and to identify the
new capable of generating performance and progress, entrepreneurship has become a condition
of sustainability and viability of the enterprise (Dinu, 2011, p. 6).
One of the most important resources for economic growth is the tourism. Worldwide, in
2013, the number of international tourists was nearly 1.1 billion (UNWTO, 2014), which
represents about 15% of the world population. Considering that, in the same reference year,
according to official statistics (NIS, 2014) Romania was visited by 1.7 million foreign
tourists, this shows that our country has only about 0.16% of world tourism. According to
the same official sources, the total number of Romanian tourists was 6.2 million (with
approximately 364% higher than the number of those who have visited our country).
Average annual increase in the number of tourists was in 2013, compared with 2012, 5%
for foreign tourists and only 3.2% for Romanian (NIS, 2014). Obviously, these data reflect
the existence of a huge growth potential of the Romanian tourism, especially in the field of
entrepreneurship, in particular by identifying some diversified ways to attract new and new
tourists and to make loyal the existing ones. In this context, we intend to identify to what
extent crowdsourcing, as a way to obtain needed services and/or ideas by soliciting
contributions from large groups of people and/or communities, using online resources and not
traditional employees or suppliers (Merriam-Webster Online, 2014; Howe, 2006; Brabham,
2008), may be an alternative for the dynamic development of entrepreneurship in Romanian
tourism.
1. Literature Review
In any modern and competitive economy, to entrepreneurship is given major attention. The term
"entrepreneur" has evolved diverse but, generally, with the same sense. Thus, in the early
eighteenth century, Say (apud. Vlăsceanu, 2010, p. 155) defined the entrepreneur as "... a
person who transfers resources from an area with lower productivity in one with higher
productivity and with higher profit, creating therefore value"; In the opinion of Cantillon, "... the
entrepreneur is essentially an independent speculator of goods" (Peters, Freha and Buhalis,
2009, p. 395); Schumpeter considered him "... a person willing and able to turn a new idea or
invention into a successful innovation" (1976, p.27); Finally, according to Drucker, the
entrepreneur is "... a person who capitalize a new possibility with maximum profit" (2006, p.29).
For its part, the term "entrepreneurship" has known different meanings. For example, for Cole,
it was "... an activity dedicated to initiation, maintenance and development of a profit-oriented
business", for Drucker "... an act of innovation, which involves endowing existing resources
with wealth-producing capacity", Stevenson appreciate that it "... is the pursuit of opportunity,
regardless of the existing resources", and Heron and Robinson "... the set of behaviors that
initiates and manages the reallocation of economic resources and whose purpose is value
creation through those means" (as cited. Rusu, 2014, p.7). Currently, the education to
stimulate the initiative to undertake has become a component part of both public policies and

also of private organizational ones. However, the fear to assume responsibilities and risks, still
exists too many people who think that to open your business, you need, first, a lot of money.
On the other hand, there are opinions according to which although "... in universities there are
some entrepreneurship courses ... they suffer from several points of view and often fail to
achieve their purpose ... Suffer, primarily because they are not taught by entrepreneurs, but
by the consultants or academics who have not developed or owned, never in their lives, a
business" (Ghenea, 2011, p.25). Obviously, this is a way to question the competence and skills
of trainers, which is unfavorable for the image of our education system. At the opposite, are
those who exaggerate, promising and even guaranteeing the success of potential entrepreneurs:
"... I assure you that if you are a" seeker ", there is a business model that you can do it
successfully, regardless of the circumstances in which you are or what experience you have
experience in business! ... THE KEY is YOUR commitment on 3-5 years during which you turn
your dream into a successful business! If everything is clear, let's start the journey towards
SUCCESS and HAPPINESS ..." (Onetiu, 2014, p. 13). And yet, in the desire to seek the new,
there are many young (and not only) which read this kind of literature, but do not have the
courage to undertake. Beyond any opinions, one thing is quite obvious: "... the stagnation
means regression, and whoever is not able to adapt as quickly, to the external environment
changes and global competition, is likely to stand outside" (Egger, Gula and Walcher,
2015). Many specialists believe that "... Entrepreneurship is an engine of sustainable
development", convinced that "... the innovative power of entrepreneurship will lead to the
next industrial revolution and towards a sustainable future" (Pacheco, Dean and Payne,
2010, p.464). Consequently, there have been a number of new conceptual notions as, for
example, sustainable entrepreneurship, entrepreneurship of the environment, ecoentrepreneurship, social entrepreneurship, etc. "Entrepreneurs see change as something
normal and healthy. Usually, these changes are not made by themselves. But - something
that defines entrepreneur and entrepreneurship - the entrepreneur always seeks the change,
responds to it, and exploits it as an opportunity" (Drucker, 1985, p.28). Regarding the
opportunity, in our opinion it has created and not "found". Although some authors consider
that "... the chance to respond to a market need (or desire or interest), through a
combination of creative resources to provide superior value" (Rusu, 2014, p.35), we consider
that opportunities like demand on the market, must be created, in order to be exploited. It is
therefore obvious that entrepreneurship is a sine qua non condition for success in life, a
mandatory premise to succeed, in general, to depend on as few people as possible, acting
brave, dynamic and effective (Popescu and State, 2014 p. 12).
Perhaps no other sector offers so many opportunities of entrepreneurship affirmation like
tourism and hospitality industry. As a result of these, in the previous 25 years in Romania
were created thousands of hotels and especially pensions, for whose promotion should deal
not only specialized institutional organizations, but also the (from our research, performed
between 30.06. 2012 - 06.30.2013) 3000 registered travel agencies nationwide. Tourism
and hospitality industry as a whole and, more recently, according to some authors, and
leisure (Rusu, 2014, p.76), is based primarily on entrepreneurship and on the activity of
small and medium seized enterprises - SMEs - (Peters, Freha and Buhalis, 2009, p. 396). In
general, entrepreneurship in tourism includes all commercial enterprises or activities
located in urban or rural areas owned by small individual entrepreneurs, groups or business
partners, private or public companies offering a wide range of services in the tourism
industry (Lordkipanidze, 2002 , p. 35, cited. Rusu, 2014, p. 76). This depends on the
involvement of local people, through their role of employees or entrepreneurs, as well as,

basically, on the socio-cultural, ideological, religious, ethical aspects, etc. (Blackstock,
2005, p. 39; Krce-Miocic, Vidic and Kovacevic, 2014, p. 144). As we mentioned, the tourism
development is a source of national wealth, in a general sense, and to enhance the income of
local communities, in particular. Consequently, the innovative contribution of all tourism
units for the revenue growth in the area is very important (Ateljevic and Page, 2009, p. 149).
Finally, all units operating in the tourism and hospitality industry are dependent in their
results, on the development of creative products and innovative entrepreneurship. In this
context, the cooperation and building networking and linkages with the environment are
particularly important factors for success in business, as a result of adaptability to market
situations under constant change. It is also important to stress that within an information
technology enabled knowledge economy the management of services is profoundly changing,
“in the sense of it being knowledge-driven, and relying on people’ s continuous development,
network intense collaboration (sharing ideas and knowledge), and value co-creation so as to
attain sustainable competitive advantage” (Plumb and Zamfir, 2009, p. 380). Simultaneously,
we have to take into account the fact that individual entrepreneurs and also small and medium
from the tourism area conducts many activities in competition with big profile multinational
chains. Under these conditions, very few entrepreneurs will be able to grow significantly and
therefore require multiple skills to be feared in competition with large companies, which
employ specialists, especially given that the business prospects of the first are limited
temporal. (Ateljevic and Page, 2009, p. 165-167). Revenue growth, resistance to a business
environment that is constantly changing, requires from any type of entrepreneurs, especially
the small and medium ones, knowledge of the real customer opinion (or what we consider
that, wrongly, Romanian legislation calls tourists). In this respect, in our study we stopped at
an innovative way to consult and take into account the opinion of entrepreneurs customers
from tourism area: crowdsourcing.
After analyzing more than 40 definitions in the literature, the most comprehensive definition of
crowdsourcing was provided by Estellés-Arolas and Ladrón-de-Guevara: "... type of online
activity, participatory, in which a person, an institution, a nonprofit organization or a
company (commercial - a.n.) proposes to a heterogeneous group of people with different
knowledge, by an open and flexible call, the voluntary undertaking of tasks of variable
complexity and modularity... The benefit will be mutual: the user will get the satisfaction of a
certain type of need (economic or social recognition, self-esteem, developing individual skills
etc. while the crowdsourcer will get and use in his interest, all information provided by the
user" (Estellés-Arolas and Ladrón-de-Guevara, 2012, p. 8-9). Crowdsourcing is a complex
compound of concepts crowd and outsourcing (Howe, 2006, p. 3) and comes from the words
(English) crowd and source. Crowdsourcing differs from outsourcing, last one defining activities
from external sources without them being ordered/requested by a group (managerial) inside the
beneficiary organization. The outsourcing of services through crowdsourcing appeals to online
platforms such as, for example, AmazonMechanicalTurk, Crowdsprings and DesignCrowd. The
addressability of crowdsourcing includes, in competitive regime, individuals and/or groups of
people and not employees or contractors, as in the case of outsourcing. Transferring
crowdsourcing through internet was motivated by the reality that individuals tend to behave
much more open on a specialized website, feeling more secure without the supervision from
third parties, of their way of thinking and, especially, to act (Smith, Gharaei-Manesh and
Alshaikh 2013, p. 23). This, all the more as the atmosphere generated by online work provides
extra attention and concentration of the tasks performers from a project, higher than the specific

situations of interpersonal communication such as "face to face". From a technical standpoint,
through crowdsourcing, entrepreneurs can, on the one hand, to identify new developments in
their field and also store them according to the interests they pursue. On the other hand, may
entrust on specialized designed platforms "basic tasks" (task-based crowd) to exchange
information with customers, related with, for example, their satisfaction with the services they
received. This will be achieved, operative, anonymously (Smith, Gharaei-Manesh and Alshaikh
2013, p. 23). At the individual level, those who turn to crowdsourcing have two reasons (Howe,
2008, p. 19; Henk van, 2010, p. 8; Brabham, 2012, p. 27-28): intrinsically (social interaction,
intellectual stimulation through competition etc.) and extrinsically (financial gain). From
another perspective, crowdsourcing can be a source of stimulating entrepreneurship as an
attractive form of promotion and manifestation of itself (De Ridder, 2008). For example, it can
be not only a simple occupational alternative of entrepreneurs, but also a genuine form of
dynamic connection of enterprises (in particular, the small and medium enterprises) to the
realities imposed by changes in the nature of innovation in the digital age (Mwila 2013, p.
1293), in both cases with a positive impact on general economic and social progress. In this
context, deeply favored and generating sustainability, viability and durability at both macro and
micro levels, crowdsourcing represents an efficient way to stimulate social entrepreneurship,
helping to create new jobs and facilitating social inclusion of persons in situations of risk (Egger,
Gula and Walcher, 2015). Without presenting an exhaustive list, but relevant for how crowds
can be called and used to perform tasks, a typology of crowdsourcing could include as forms:
the crowdvoting; the crowdfunding; the microwork; creative crowdsourcing; etc. (Howe, 2008;
Saxton and Kishore, 2013; Lombard, 2013; Brabham, 2012).
2. Objectives, hypotheses and research methodology
The main objective of our applicative research was to outline the way in which
crowdsourcing can contribute to the development of entrepreneurship in the Romanian
tourism. As we pointed out, in order to initiate and/or to develop their business, tourism
entrepreneurs must on the one hand, to have a real perception of the degree of satisfaction of
their clients for the services they receive and on the other hand, to encourage them to appeal at
crowdsourcing. This implies the professionalization of external organizational communication,
in terms of using the means offered by the digital age. In the context of our research, we
considered crowdsourcing from the perspective of the interaction between tourism entrepreneurs
and customers, as a new form of external organizational communication. In this sense, given
that, so far, in Romania, there is no study in the investigated field, we focused our research
approach on two axes, respectively, on the ways in which is:
a) designed and built by entrepreneurs, the external organizational communication of tourism
units (basically how they offer their services to customers);
b) perceived by customers (tourists), the image of tourism units in the light of their feedback
via crowdsourcing, concerning the degree of satisfaction with the services they received.
We started our approach with the following dilemma (which was also the main hypothesis):
why, given that, about the results of Romanian tourism, people speak generally, in praise
terms, the approach of organizational communication in tourism units is empirically and
is based primarily on intuition and experience. In our opinion, this is potentially generating
false perceptions of customers about the services of tourism units and therefore may affect,
major, directly and unfavorable, organizational performance.

for obtaining sustainable economic performances by the tourism units were:
I.1 Entrepreneurs/managers of tourism units does not take a consistent approach for the
organizational communication, based on the substantiation, development and implementation of
strategies and/or appropriate tactics to attract tourists. Consequently, in many situations,
promoting the tourism units is a direct result of advertising carried out by the media;
I.2 Organizational communication processes (both internal and external) are initiated, usually
ad hoc, depending on current issues without being based on coherent plans of action and/or
customer feedback. This is likely to jeopardize the sustainability of the specialized units activity,
including towards reducing desire to develop tourism businesses;
I.3 The substantiation and the adoption of the decision to purchase goods or services is
determined, primarily, by documentation taken by customers of tourism units and not by the
efficiency of the way in which entrepreneurs in the field promote their own image.
We decided that after testing three hypotheses, to formulate a set of proposals able to ensure
competitiveness and sustainability of the activity of units in the field and especially, as a result
of crowdsourcing, to become a viable alternative to the dynamic development of entrepreneurship
in general, to the tourism and hospitality industry, in particular.
Methodologicaly, both the professionalism analysis shown by tourism entrepreneurs in
promoting their own image as well as the degree of customer satisfaction were made by
crowdsourcing, as a potential method of qualitative inquiry, the instrument of information
collection was a questionnaire placed on each of the specially constituted two platforms.
Basically, what we propose is an implementation crowdsourcing's debut in tourism, especially
if we consider that we haven’t committed any micro-tasks to the participants nor we
haven’t rewarded financially respondents of the questionnaires created (procedure requires
that, on average, a micro-task solved - a questionnaire, in our case - to be paid by 15-20
cents). From a financial standpoint, the effort of the websites creators would not be
consistent when measured against the importance of the results (respectively, a more
realistic picture on the quality on the one hand, of organizational communication and on the
other hand, of services which benefited the customers of tourism units). For example, in
addition to the cost of achieving online platform, in the case of its access by entrepreneurs in
tourism (direction in which the National Association of Travel Agencies (ANAT) could
make an important contribution), compensation of each micro-task (questionnaire, in this
case) would require approximately 15000 units for the Romanian tourism units (hotels,
hostels, pensions etc. and travel agencies - data source: author's calculations, based on all
available sources of information), expenses of about 3000 USD. Regarding the implementation
of crowdsourcing in tourism as a means of stimulating the entrepreneurship, on the one hand,
we wanted to raise awareness of entrepreneurs in the industry to use this procedure in order
to get to know the satisfaction degree of their customers and, on the other hand we aimed to
demonstrate that, in the digital age, the possibilities for interaction between entrepreneurs
and customers are more diversified, efficient and responsive to the environment changes.
Questions of the two questionnaires (one for managers/entrepreneurs in tourism, the other
for customers of tourism units) were designed based on surveys models developed and
applied in the field (Fuller, 2000 by Veert, 2007 apud. Deaconu et al., 2014, p.698) in
collaboration with experts (academics) in psychology. Each questionnaire included 20
questions each, in our research being covered the subsumed of the intended purpose.
Methodologically, in our research the knowledge of the respondents' opinion was made by
their free consent to access the websites specially created and not as a result of calling the
recipients already known. Being announced, through various social media ways, on the
opportunities to interact with entrepreneurs in tourism units and their clients, respondents
accessed, when and where they wanted (time interval for which we consulted the accessing of
the two websites was February, 15 to August, 30, 2014), online platforms available to them at
<http://goo.gl/sgzjU> (for assessing the quality of organizational communication in tourism
units) and at <http://goo.gl/ JUaLx> (to assess customer satisfaction towards the quality of
organizational communication in tourism units). We reveal that these platforms are
permanently operative.
The first questionnaire, the one offering to entrepreneurs from tourism the opportunity to access
the platform available at <http://goo.gl/sgzjU>, included questions about aspects with character:
a) general concerning the organization and in the broad sense organizational communication;
In this context, we sought to identify whether the profile activity is followed at the managerial
level or at the one related with some organizational specialized subdivisions (as, for example,
the marketing department, department of communication and public relations, etc.); b) specific,
about who and how performs profile activities and what methods are used to stimulate and
facilitate effective networking of tourism units, on the one hand and to ensure the development
of training their employees, on the other part. This questionnaire has been accessed by 157
entrepreneurs/managers from tourism. There were some situations where those who accessed
the online platform did not answer to all questions.
The second questionnaire available at <http://goo.gl/JUaLx>, offered to any customer of
tourism units to formulate opinions on: travel frequency (internal and external) on interest
category (private, for business or mixed); the documentary sources called before making the
trip and whether they were helpful; their perception about the professionalism of
entrepreneurs in tourism, from the perspective of the way to design and conduct
organizational communication in accordance with their expectations and, especially, from the
effectiveness of customer loyalty programs on tourism units (whether it is tourism
accommodation units or the travel agencies). The number of respondents who accessed
voluntarily specialized websites was of 2478.
From methodological point of view, to characterize the degree of professionalism of
external organizational communication from tourism units, we used the analysis of
variance - ANOVA coupled with SPSS for Windows, version 15.
Using ANOVA (according to Ostertagova and Ostertag, 2013, p. 256, "... most often cited
research method in the literature of business" was a logical consequence of the questions
used in the questionnaire. In our case, we started from the fact that ANOVA is used when:
 are analyzed differences between groups (tourism units classified by category of
classification) from the perspective of one or more variables (each question);
 the participants (respondents) were tested (interviewed) in the study only once;
 are compared more than two groups (tourism units).
Briefly, ANOVA One-Way procedure (Ostertagova and Ostertag, 2013, p. 256-261) considered
that we have values of the random independent and normal variables (tourism units, by type
of classification) Xi,j, where: i = 1, 2, …, k and j = 1, 2,…, ni, with the mean µi and with
standard deviation constant σ, Xi,j - N (µi, σ). Alternatively, each Xi,j = µi + εi,j, where εi,j are
normally distributed , have values of errors εi,j - N (0, σ). Be N = n1 + n2 + … + nk total number
of tourism units (n1 being hotels from first group, with the classification of 5 stars). The
parameters of this model are each question µ1, µ2, …, µk, standard deviation σ.

and s2 = MSE is an estimation of the σ2 variance, common to all samples (tourism units):

then ANOVA One-Way is focused around the idea of comparing the difference between groups

3. Research results
After consulting both crowdsourcing platforms, analyzing and interpreting the answers to
the questionnaires, we found the following:
a) concerning the way in which entrepreneurs and/or managers of tourism units
approaches organizational communication: in contradiction with the number of tourism units
customers who accessed the online platforms to answer to the launched questions, number
respondents in tourism units may seem very small (157), compared to the existing one. We,
however, consider, besides the fact that such a method is in the phase of proposal for
implementation, being space for many improvements, both conceptual-methodological and
operational and also the one according to which, as found, there is fear and even rejection, a
priori, to new.
Related to the way in which tourism entrepreneurs develop and promote their image through
organizational communication, respondents were able to express their views on the question
"Who carries out external communication?". We found that, with majority, it is not in charge
of a compartment or a skilled person, but in the one of the director or general manager,
which explains the direct proportionality between the classification of the unit and the degree
of professionalization of the activities related with internal communication and in particular,
of promoting their own images to the environment. In cases where the director or manager
assumes, exclusively, responsibilities related with the external organizational
communication, the correlation coefficient is minimal (F=15.132), compared to the situation
where there is a specialized compartment (F=21.719), as follows also from the data
presented in table. no. 2. Statistically, all thresholds of significance p are relevant, which
leads to the idea that the results can be extrapolated to organizational reality. Normal
appears to us that also in the case where it appeals to external consulting ("external
partners") the result is higher (F=32.316). The situation is presented with priority for 5 star
hotels. Since all values of p are statistically significant (p ≤ 0.05) it can be accepted the
validity of the main hypothesis. In this context, eloquent appears to us that taking "control"
on everything that means organization's image to the environment and even to its own
employees can only have an adverse effect on the adaptability of entrepreneurial initiatives
to its demands. We refer to the fact that not knowing the reality from the environment as
little subjective as possible, coupled with even disregarding its feedback, these are
generating, as a result of reliance on experience and intuition, empiricism in action.
By consulting the answers to the question "... Specify what ways you use in the external
communication process and how do you appreciate their effectiveness", we found that in most
tourism units, internet, email and social networks are estimated to be the most effective forms
of external organizational communication. In this respect, the fact that F is high (F=41.914,
respectively, F=40.693) only confirms the reduced focus placed by entrepreneurs/ managers on
the feedback received from customers. As, again, in all cases, p ≤ 0.05, is reconfirmed the
validity of the main hypothesis, significant values of F (as shown in table no. 2) confirms also
the validity of the first secondary hypotheses. As a particular aspect, we are really surprised by
the confidence of tourism units’ management given to social networks. We consider that it
would be more useful to entrepreneurs in tourism, initiatives based on information provided by
specialists in the field, context in which crowdsourcing can be an excellent alternative,
specialized platforms being accessed only by those who are subscribed to them.
To allow us to form a more complete picture on the professionalism of entrepreneurs in
promoting their own image, in order to attract and make loyal customers, we addressed the
question: "Do you have in your unit, customer loyalty programs?". The responses received
were demotivating for at least two reasons: either many entrepreneurs/managers say they don’t
have such programs or, if the answer "yes", the efficiency is totally insignificant (percentages
of maximum 10 to 15 points of loyal customers, as a percentage in total customers).
The conclusion is reinforced (table no. 2) also by the fact that the result in ANOVA p=0.534

indicates (p≥0,05), respectively, F=0.824. Consequently, we should not be surprised at all by
the fact that the lack of professionalism in the field is a state of "normality", especially given
that customer loyalty through "other forms" refers to "relations" of tourism units’ management
with syndicates from different organizations, "relations" whose direct result is to provide a
greater degree of occupancy of the accommodation capacity. In this case, as shown in table
no. 2, the effectiveness of the 'other forms' is supported, as "effectiveness" by the values of p and
F (p=0 and F=5.675). These findings confirm the validity of the second secondary hypotheses.
Finally, the question "If you use internal communication audits, what aspects you follow
with priority?" we were surprised to find out that the majority of respondents are interested in
the image to third parties and customer relations, much less their loyalty. In this context, as is
apparent from the data presented in table no. 2, the low values of F (F=1.223, F=2.798,
respectively, F=1.17) correlated with the high p (p=0.301, p=0.119, respectively, p=0.326)
lead to the conclusion of the insignificantly of organizational communication audits. Basically,
we are not very clear whether, if indeed in Romanian tourism units (except those with a
higher classification, 4 and 5 stars), are made this kind of audit actions. The findings lead us
again to the conclusion of validity also for the second secondary hypotheses.
It becomes obvious, as a preliminary conclusion that the interaction between tourism
entrepreneurs is real and not declaratively required. Context in which, we insist that appealing
to crowdsourcing can prove useful by giving micro-tasks to anyone interested in contributing
to the development of tourism activities. For example, a variant can be, by providing a
crowdsourcing platform, nationally, offering, to entrepreneurs from the field (and not only)
the opportunity to consult and to propose solutions to problems faced in their work, especially
in the restrictive conditions imposed by the environment constantly changing and increasingly
less friendly.

b) regarding the satisfaction degree of tourism units customers:
Concerning the manner of documentation appealed by customers to purchase travel services
and their perception of their usefulness, the obtained results were convincing, as follows:
- the majority of respondents (2415, respectively, 97,45% from the total) appeals, with
priority, at internet and at friends and/or known people (data are presented in table no. 3).

Processing in ANOVA has certified the conclusions regarding the appealing by customers of
tourism units, at internet and at friends or known people. The coefficients F and p validate
also the third secondary hypothesis (F=59.607 and p=0.000, respectively, F=51.893 and
p=0.0071). The data are presented in table no. 7;
- regarding the level of customer confidence in the usefulness of information sources
appealed, degree reflected in the fidelity towards the facts met in the field, from the data
presented in table no. 4 (for 2411 respondents), results that, with priority (2097 respondents,
respectively, 86.98% of the total), customers of tourism units have enough confidence in the
usefulness of information sources consulted. Only 118 (4.89% of total) have total confidence in
it. Again, the results of econometrical processing certified the findings regarding the
validation of the third secondary hypotheses (F=91.779 and p=0.000), as follows from
the data presented in table no. 7.

- assessing the real usefulness of the information received by the travel units’ customers is
shown in table no. 5 (we had 2411 responses). As can be seen, almost 95% of customers
have a medium degree of confidence in the usefulness of the information provided by
organizations in the tourism and hospitality industry:

The results of processing in ANOVA (table no. 7) validates the third secondary hypothesis
(F=27.079 and p=0.000);
- the overall customer perception on the interest of tourism units to have a significant feedback
from their customers is unfavorable, most people who have used online crowdsourcing
platform saying they believe that they were "interviewed" only statistically. Finally, our survey
respondents said they did not feel to be treated as customers, just like "tourists" consumers. In
this respect, deeply unfavorable for those responsible of tourism units (entrepreneurs,
managers, etc.) is the perception of customers that their essential purpose is to "snag tourist". It
is quite obvious, also in this case, that the ignorance of the reality perceived by customers can
only be deeply unproductive for entrepreneurship in the Romanian tourism. Data for respondents'
perception on the possibility of being treated as future loyal customers are shown in table. no 6.

Conclusions
The concerns regarding diversification of the ways in which tourism entrepreneurs can
motivate participants at crowdsourcing dates back more than 10 years. As relevant in the part
dedicated to literature review, entrepreneurs in tourism considers a priority the manner of
information transmission, using various means offered by the digital age. Smith, GharaeiManesh and Alshaikh showed that, "... with the involvement of as many customers as possible
in crowdsourcing activities, their desires and requirements may be established and retained"
(2013, pp. 24-25). Currently, worldwide, there are some great crowdsourcing projects in
tourism, from the collection of comments and descriptions relating their experiences of tourists,
to the collection of images of the places they visited in order to create reference albums.
Our study is the first of its kind in Romania. A limit of our research could be that the two
online platforms for data and information collection are only a first attempt of
crowdsourcing, not giving crowdsourced services or micro-tasks, to be paid. However, we
believe that with further research, including by making available to those who represent
entrepreneurs in tourism and their interests (Romanian Minister of Tourism, ANAT etc.) ideas
and potential ways of concrete action, we can sensitize decision makers in the creation of
crowdsourcing platforms in order, first, to facilitate the collection of information from
customers of tourism units, extremely useful information for future business development in
the field and/or improvement of existing ones. In this sense, an example of how crowdsourcing
can contribute to the stimulation of entrepreneurship in tourism is provided by Wikitravel, a
project that aims to create an online travel guide available for worldwide use. Another very
good example is Holidaycheck, a crowdsourcing platform through which increasingly more
tourists are informing before starting a journey. In Romania this is possible by creating, for
example, a portal where customers should express their impressions, evaluations and advices
for prospective customers and entrepreneurs and/or managers in the tourism and hospitality
industry.
We made these considerations because our study aims to reveal how crowdsourcing can
contribute to the development entrepreneurial spirit in Romanian tourism. As a result of
analyzing the views expressed by respondents who accessed the websites available at
<http://goo.gl/sgzjU> and at <http://goo.gl/JUaLx>, we demonstrated that, at present, the
approach to organizational communication of units tourism is primarily empirical and based
on experience and intuition of the decision makers. As a direct consequence, both
entrepreneurs and/or managers from tourism (157 respondents) and the beneficiaries of their
services, customers (2478 respondents, of which, to a question answered only 2411 people),
are likely to base their decisions on subjective perceptions, respectively on personal effort
documentation.
The fact that in many of the tourism units in our country there is no consistent scientific
approach to activity promotion and development of their image, which should be based on
reliable information from beneficiaries of the services offered, this can be improved
substantially and decisively by appealing to crowdsourcing. Basically, through crowdsourcing,
entrepreneurs can, on the one hand, stimulate customers of tourism units involvement in the
improvement of profile activities and, on the other hand, they can redesign and/or extend
development strategies taking into account their opinions.
The results of our research approach (approach which will be extended in a more ample work,
first in the domain of methods for improving organizational communication in tourism units
from Romania) constitutes a first step towards a new way more constructive, scientifically
more rigorous of substantiating the services offered by tourism entrepreneurs to their
customers on their expressed feedback on crowdsourcing platforms.
Finally, we express our belief that appealing to crowdsourcing practice is much more than just a
necessity, it constitutes itself into an alternative for developing dynamic, viable and sustainable
entrepreneurial spirit in Romanian tourism.
