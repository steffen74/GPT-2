New aspects of sustainable development as a factor of competitiveness in the EU
Analysis of meeting the climate-energy goals
In March 2014 the European Commission published a document that provides an overview of the
state–in achieving the set goals the Europe 2020 Strategy (European Commission, 2014c). The following
text provides an overview of the progress achieved the third climate-energy goal on the basis of:
6. Reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases by 20%; between 1990 and 2012, the emissions of
greenhouse gases, at EU level decreased by 18% due to the contractor's climate and energy policy,
but it had a significant impact economic stagnation, which is why this objective will be achieved even
exceeded to 24% by 2020;
7. Increasing the share of renewable energy in final consumption by 20%; the share of renewable energy
in energy consumption in the EU increased by 5.9% in the period from 2005 to 2012 and in 2012 it
was 14.4%. If the trend continues to increase, the EU is on track to reach the set target of 21%.
8. Increasing energy efficiency by 20%; there has been some progress in increasing energy efficiency,
but the achievement of the set goal of 20% is needed to reduce primary energy consumption by
another 6.3%.

Analysis of the climate-energy objectives shows that CO2 emissions were below the national
targets foreseen for 2020 in 15 Member States (Cyprus, Hungary, Italy, Greece, Spain, Portugal,
Czech Republic, Romania, Slovakia, Lithuania, Slovenia, Malta, Latvia, Bulgaria and Poland) while
the best results realized in Luxembourg, Denmark and Sweden.
The EU is currently the world leader in investing in renewable energy, especially, in the
development of wind energy and solar energy. Although, in general we can speak of progress in most
Member States additional efforts are needed to achieve this objective. National targets for increasing
the share of renewable energy in final consumption ranged from 10% in Malta to 49% in Sweden.
The level of primary energy consumption in Cyprus, Estonia, Greece, Finland, Croatia, Hungary,
Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Luxembourg, Poland, Spain, Italy and
Slovenia was below their national indicative targets (Figure 1).

These variations in national targets in relation to setting goals are influenced by the following reasons:


the impact of the economic crisis and the stagnation of the temporary progress in achieving the
goals, implementation of instruments from the category of resource efficient Europe and complementary
regulations from the Climate and Energy package and



reduction of carbon intensity and use of appropriate structural and other funds in order to improve
the production and consumption model "the establishment of a vision of structural and
technological changes" for the transition (by 2050) to a low-carbon economy (European
Commission, 2009b).
In 2012 the European economy was almost twice less carbon intensive (the amount of emissions

per unit of GDP) (European Commission, 2014a). If the achieved results measure in relation to the
obligations arising from the Kyoto Protocol (8% in the period 2008-2012 compared to 1990), it is
estimated that the EU-15 has decreased its emissions already in 2011 in excess of the envisaged
commitments (14.6%) (EU, Sustainable Development in the European Union, 2013). The policy
proposal for climate change and energy for the period from 2020 to 2030 aim to make the EU's
economy more competitive, safer and sustainable (European Commission, 2014b).However, it should
be borne in mind that in the current and future development of the member states, the overall position
of, first of all, the energy sector, the existing international and other obligations and the real
opportunities of the economy and society for achieving the reduction of CO2 emissions as one of the
climate and energy goals.
In 2009, the EU economy suffered great damage and a fall of 4.5%. The temporary suspension
of the economic decline in 2010 was short and the negative trends continued in 2011 and 2012. The
gradual recovery started in 2013, with a realistic expected GDP growth of 1.5% in 2014 and 2.0% at
the EU level in 2015 with significant differences between member states. Progress is the result of
valid climate and energy policies, but economic stagnation has had a significant impact.
In order to achieve the climate and energy goal related to reducing CO2 emissions, instruments
are divided into two groups: industrial policy for the globalization era and resource efficient Europe
(European Commission, 2010b, 2011). The first group of instruments is related to a precise analysis
of new regulations that will be made from the point of view of their impact on competitiveness. The
second group of instruments is related to the mobilization of financial instruments (rural development,
structural funds, research and development programs, etc.), strengthening the framework for the use
of market based instruments (trade in emissions, compensation in the energy sector, state aid policy,
public procurement), modernization of the transport sector (network infrastructure, intelligent traffic
management, better logistics, new technologies in the road, air and maritime sectors to reduce CO2
emissions, including green initiatives in the automotive sector), promotion of renewable energy in
the single market, European networks (including trans-European energy network, "smart grids" and interconnection of renewable energy sources on the network, improvement of infrastructure projects
of strategic importance for the EU in the Baltic, the Balkans, the Mediterranean and the Eurasian
region), the adoption and revision of the Energy Action Plan efficiency (support to small and medium
enterprises and households).
The reasons for the different achieving the climate and energy goal should also be sought in the
instruments defined in four groups of complementary regulations (Decision No 406/2009 /EC) under the
Climate and Energy Package (European Commission, 2009a):


regulations relating to the revision and strengthening of the trade system for emission
allowances, which is a key EU tool for effectively reducing the cost of emissions;



a decision on the "sharing effort" that regulates emissions from sectors not covered by the EU
ETS, such as transport, housing, agriculture, waste;



binding national targets for renewable energy-related decision-making, which regulates
emissions from sectors not covered by the EU ETS, such as transport, housing, agriculture,
waste and



binding national targets for renewable energy sources, whose goal is to jointly increase the share
of renewable energy sources in the EU by 20% by 2020 and improving the development and
safe use of carbon capture and storage techniques.
The reduction in CO2 emissions has also been influenced by the use of appropriate structural and

other funds, and in order to improve the production and consumption model, "establishing a vision of
structural and technological changes" for the transition (by 2050) to a low carbon economy. Within the
framework of this initiative, the planned activities at Member State level include the following:


the abolition of subsidies that are harmful to the environment, other than those relating to
persons with disabilities,



changes in market instruments such as fiscal incentives and acquisitions in order to adapt to
production and consumption methods, development,



improving and fully linking transport and energy infrastructure, ensuring coordinated
implementation of infrastructure projects, which should contribute to the effectiveness of the
overall transport system of the EU and



the use of regulations, the construction of performance standards and market instruments,
subsidies, public procurement to reduce the use of energy and resources.

New aspects of sustainable development as a factor of competitiveness in the EU
2. Environmental sustainability as a factor of economic progress of EU countries
Environmental sustainability in EU countries is assessed on the basis of Environmental
Performance Index (EPI). EPI ranks countries' performance on high-priority environmental issues in
two areas: the protection of human health and the protection of ecosystems. Among the top ten best
eco-ranking country among 180 countries in 2016, according to the EPI index there are 9 countries
from the EU: Finland, Sweden, Denmark, Slovenia, Spain, Portugal, Estonia, Malta and France
(elsewhere the Island). In relation to the measurement of the EPI index in 2014 in the top five
environmental states there are countries that have not been in these positions in the previous year, and
the first place Iceland was taken from Finland (Table 2).

Countries have achieved a high rank because of the production of electricity from renewable
sources, the use of alternative sources of energy production which increases the energy productivity, waste recycling, organic agriculture development and other measures that promote the sustainability
of the economy.
Relationship between GDP and the EPI in EU countries
Countries in the EU tend to have higher scores EPI index in relation to their GDP. This tendency
means that countries with greater financial resources can better implement regulations to protect
human health and the environment. The objectives of the development of EU member states should
show a positive relationship between EPI and GDP, and that the growth in national wealth improves
environmental impact.
The relationship between higher values of EPI index and higher GDP is achieved in the case
of Sweden, Finland, Germany, Denmark, Spain and Slovenia. Luxembourg has the highest GDP but
per EPI score is at position 20 (Figure 2).

3. Environmental sustainability EU countries as a factor of competitiveness
The analysis of the competitive advantages of national economies has dealt with a number of
studies in terms of urban competitiveness (Ni et al., 2014, Huggins and Clifton, 2011; Martin and
Simmie, 2008), sustainable development (Van and Handy, 2016; McCabe, 2012; Grant and Barton,
2013; Wheeler and Beatley, 2004; Satterthwaite , 1999, etc.) and sustainable competition (Balkyte and Tvaronavičiene, 2010; Wysokińska, 2003; Tukker and Tischner, 2006; Davoudi, 2003; Glachant,
Schucht and Bültmann, 2002; Testa et al., 2014, etc.).
Comparison progress between the EU, globally, and each country individually considering a clever,
sustainable and inclusive growth according to the 2020 Strategy, indicates the relationship between the
increase in productivity, innovation economy and environmental protection, and environmental
sustainability. In EU countries using environment funds are developed for economic activity and
innovative framework for the contribution of fundamental research to increase value-added products. The
gap in the developed countries is caused by application of the European digital agenda, competitiveness,
growth rates, in particular the youth unemployment.
Similar problems exist at the regional level where there is a difference in the more prosperous north
and north-west European part, in relation to the Southern and south-eastern part. The increase in productivity
should take into account the comparative and competitive advantages of the EU Member States.
The Index Environmental sustainability analysis shows that 14 countries have a lower score than
the EU average. Regionally, this ratio is higher in Northern Europe and North-western Europe as
compared to Southern Europe and Central and Eastern Europe (Table 3).
Countries with high scores and rank (the highest in Sweden and Finland) innovate, develop digital
economy and entrepreneurship, foster cooperation of universities and the private sector in research, have
developed and applicable institutional framework related to environmental protection and development
of the economy which is environmentally friendly.
In countries whose score is below the EU average there are problems related to the quality of the
environment, low capacity to implement environmental legislation, the gap between competitiveness and
European targets, low energy efficiency, high CO2 emissions, financing and development efforts for the
preservation of the environment.

Total ranking in the EU countries is the based on several indicators: basic requirements (sub
index: institutions, infrastructure, macroeconomic environment and health and primary education),
efficiency enhancers (sub index: higher education and training, goods market efficiency, labour
market efficiency, financial market development, technological readiness and market size) and
innovation and sophistication factors (sub index: business sophistication and innovation).

Analysis of the relationship between the total of the rank and the rank on the basis of
environmental sustainability shows positive deviations (the country in which the rank environmental
sustainability>total rank) in 13 EU countries: Sweden, Austria, France, Portugal, Italy, Greece,
Slovenia, Lithuania, Latvia, Slovak Republic, Croatia, Bulgaria and Romania. The biggest difference
between this two rankings were recorded in Latvia, on the basis of, so it can be concluded that within
the EU there are countries which are not highly ranked according to the total ranking, but take care
of the environmental sustainability (Table 4).

4. The EU legislation to increase energy efficiency and environmental protection
The development of cleaner technologies, increasing energy efficiency and reducing waste will
affect the reduction of environmental pollution in the EU by 2020. Most important legal instruments
for the sector of industrial pollution control and risk management in the EU are Directives for the
prevention of major accidents involving hazardous materials, prevention and control pollution,
improving energy efficiency in final consumption and energy services, energy performance of
buildings, the labelling of the energy efficiency level of technical devices and equipment, the
establishment of the register of release and transfer of pollutants and other.
For the successful implementation of EU directives and regulations in the field of
environmental protection and energy efficiency it is important to carry out the harmonization of
national legislation with the EU in the field of environmental protection which contributes to a more
efficient achievement of the objectives (Figure 4).

4.1. The EMAS system as a function of increasing environmental quality
The EMAS (Eco-Management and Audit Scheme) is the EU instrument which gives the
opportunity to organizations on a voluntary basis to introduce and promote eco-management. In this
system organizations from different sectors (business, education, public administration, etc.) are
included. Companies registered in the EMAS have an obligation to define environmental policy
which continuously applies, to implement environmental protection measures and to report regularly
on state environment and environmental measures. The EMAS scheme includes the EU Member
States, the Member States EEY-European Economic Area (Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein) and
the countries candidates for accession to the EU. According to statistics from the European Commission over 3.600 enterprises have registered in
the system and they have the right to use the EMAS logo which is a guarantee of their quality of
environmental management.
The analysis size enterprises within EMAS system, according to the number of employees in
accordance with the international classification, shows dominated participation by small (33.99%) and
medium enterprises (31.19%) (Table 5, Figure 5). Accordingly, about two-thirds of companies in the
EMAS system are small and medium-sized enterprises, and it is not negligible also the participation of
large companies with around 20%. Among the big companies there are 12 companies with over 10,000
employees. The largest number of employees in the company is 44,725 is in the Italian company from
Lombardy, which deals with the activity expressed by code 64.11-Central banking.

The countries with the largest number of enterprises in EMAS system are Italy (901) and Spain
(840) with 72% of all registered enterprises account from these two countries. The majority of
companies in the Spain are small (35.31) and medium-sized enterprises (29.85%). In Italy, a similar situation because dominated small and medium-sized enterprises with a slightly higher share of small
enterprises than in Spain (27.93 medium and 39.67 small enterprises).
The analysis of the enterprises structure according to the NACE code (Table 6) shows that the
largest number of enterprises are registered within the group 30.00-39.99 (25.39%) and the groups 80.0089.99 (20.04%). Within the first group, the largest number of enterprises deals with the Collection of nonhazardous waste, and within the second group with General public administration activities. The NACE
codes indicate the diversification of the prevailing activity of companies that are in the EMAS system.
The registration of registered companies is within the group 01.00-09.99 (2.22%).

coincidence for the previous analysis according to which the largest number of registered enterprises is
between code 30-40 and 80-90. The previous analysis has more precisely identified the NACE codes,
divided into groups and subgroups, however, the conclusion is that companies with Waste and Disposal
and Public Administration have the largest share in the EMAS register (Table 7 and Figure 6).

Previous analysis of the enterprises in the EMAS register points to the existence of differences
in the number of companies per country, their size and the prevailing NACE code. These differences
can be explained by the existence and development of personal and collective responsibility for the
environment of enterprises, citizens and the state. The development of corporate social responsibility
combines three main areas: production (improvement in efficiency and organization of production),
social relations (workplace conditions, health and safety at work) and the environment (cleaner
production, more rational use of raw materials and reduction of waste generation, and emission).
Appropriate knowledge of the state of the ecosystem and their ability to deliver services (and how
human activities affect this ability) is a prerequisite for the -good management of nature. Countries
like Ireland, Norway and the Netherlands encourage in various ways the development of
responsibility not only of enterprises, but also of individuals. A large number of countries are
implementing measures that meet both personal and collective responsibility for environmental
problems. Thus, responsibility for the protection and management of the environment in Ireland
represents a shared responsibility involving all citizens (mobilizing more than 4.5 million citizens to
ensure that the environment is part of their everyday decisions and procedures). In Norway there is
an increased awareness of the value of ecosystem services and their connection to sustainability.
The government of the Netherlands announced in 2014 that it will modernize its environmental policy
to include the public, enterprises and other bodies in the field of environment and sustainable
development. This policy focuses on public health, as well as the formulation of an approach that emphasizes the benefits of new ecological products and the emergence of health problems related to
environmental pollution.
The registration of enterprises in the EMAS system affected the possibility of financing the
EMAS system whereby Member States provide individual support mechanisms for those interested
in implementing this system. There are many schemes in different EU member states that place
special emphasis on supporting the participation of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in
the EMAS. The European Commission encourages individual Member States to provide support
mechanisms for organizations, especially SMEs wishing to implement EMAS. Local authorities,
chambers of commerce and stakeholders can provide assistance to small and medium-sized
enterprises in identifying significant environmental impacts, which SMEs can use to define an
environmental protection program and EMAS.
Financial support is provided for broader activities through tenders, for submission of project
proposals, especially for support of SMEs. Financing can also be provided by the European
Commission through the-LIFE-Environment - program, run by the European Commission's
Directorate-General for Environmental Protection, for projects that meet the requirements of the
program. The costs of implementing EMAS are divided into external and internal ones.
4.2. Future challenges eco-management
The development and application of eco-management in the EU leads to importance of energy
managers and energy management taxpayers. The presence of energy managers is necessary in
companies with a predominant activity in the manufacturing sector (industrial plants) whose energy
consumption is above the level prescribed by law, as well as, in the municipalities with more than
20.000 buildings and other facilities in public ownership. Taxpayers energy management are obliged
to implement energy efficiency measures, increase energy efficiency, appoint the required number of
energy managers or energy officers and to submit annual reports on energy efficiency.
The candidate countries for accession to the EU have an obligation to harmonize national
legislation with legislation, regulations and directives EU in the field of environmental protection.
For the Republic of Serbia, as a candidate for accession to the EU, progress in this area is analysed in
Chapter 27: Environment and climate change. Eco-management is achieved by forming eco register
for environmental information in electronic form, participating in the European network of
environmental information and observation of the environment (EIONET) and other grids. The development of eco-management should be accompanied by the introduction of incentives
and credit lines based on the system of obligatory reporting on energy consumption and measures
taken, as well as, by discouraging the consumption of energy through additional taxation of excessive
and inefficient spending. Also, it is necessary to establish standards for energy efficiency, the
introduction of mandatory energy audits, the introduction of energy buildings and mandatory energy
management for large energy consumers and local governments.
5. Ecological network in the function of preserving the environment
One of the most important parameters in the future development of the countries of Southeast
Europe in the process integration into the EU is the protection and conservation of nature. For this
purpose, there are several ecological networks: Natura2000, Emerald and Pan-European networks.
Natura2000 is a network of core breeding for rare and threatened species, and some rare natural
habitat types which are protected in their own right. It stretches across all 28 EU countries, both on
land and at sea. The aim of the network is to ensure the long-term survival of Europe's most valuable
and threatened species and habitats, both listed under the Birds Directive and the Habitats Directive.
Emerald is an ecological network made up of areas of special importance for the protection of
nature (Special Areas of Conservation Importance-ASCI) or spatial entities and habitats that are of
special national and international importance in terms of preserving biodiversity. This network, which
is built on the same principles as Natura2000, established by the Council of Europe for countries that
are in the process of joining the EU, it is activity part of in the implementation of the Bern Convention
on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats.
The Pan-European Ecological Network (PEEN) was established with the aim of long-term
preservation of ecosystems, habitats and species of protection at European level. The PEEN network
predicts the existence of the central zone, which would form the Natura2000 and Emerald areas, then
routes that connect the central zone and enable the migration and dispersal of species, and transitional
zones and restoration areas, with a lower degree of protection from the central zone.
Information about the network Natura2000 in the EU countries show stretches over 18% of the
EU's land area and almost 6% of its marine territory. Countries with the largest share in the total area
networks (over 30%) are Croatia, Slovenia and Bulgaria. The largest number of protected sites within
the network is in Germany, Sweden and Italy (Table 6).

The Implementation of projects and programs under the Natura2000 network is important for
the conservation of biodiversity:
1. WWF Danube-Carpathian Program Bulgaria is a project undertaken with the intention of creating
new jobs in a country that belongs to the poorest among the communities. Four innovative programs
influenced an increase in sales of agricultural products, but also the protection of biodiversity.

2. Programs in Belgium and France around Natura2000 sites related to the testing of alternative
methods for keeping the land around the power lines and the creation of green corridors in the wooded
areas.
3. The Government of Andalusia since 2002 has been implementing projects that encourage the
protection of Natura2000. The Iberian lynx is a protected species which is threatened with extinction,
but on the basis of projects and initiatives for preserve the lynx, with the cooperation of all relevant
public and private parties, came to the recovery of this species. Stewardship agreements and voluntary
contracts have been signed with 132 private owners, managers and hunting clubs in six Natura2000
sites.
4. Projects with the support of the EU LIFE program and the Norwegian Environment Fund are being
implemented simultaneously in seven Natura2000 sites across Europe and key actions include the
introduction of a standardized monitoring program and habitat restoration work in core areas such as,
the Evros Delta National Park in Greece and the Hortobágy National Park in Hungary.
Conclusion
The paper emphasizes the importance of preserving the environment, both in terms of
sustainable development, but also in terms of competitiveness and a better economic situation of the
national economy. The imperative of the development of modern economy is sustainable growthgreen growth and innovative economy. The EU has recognized the importance of environmental
protection and has implemented this question in the most important programmatic document. Each
state has an obligation to adapt national legislation of the EU Directive in this area.
Objective of the analysis in this paper is to demonstrate the existence of the correlation
between economic development and environmental sustainability, but also the existence of
differences within the individual parts of Europe and countries in terms of environmental
preservation. The adoption of climate and energy targets is also a good example of targets that are
binding for the country in terms of finding mechanisms for achieving the objectives.
Examples of positive practice ecological development show an increase in energy efficiency,
sustainable use of resources, the establishment of ecological networks and further development of
eco-management.
