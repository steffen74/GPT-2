
Transportation is one of the activities in which
perishable food products may suffer mechanical
damage, which translates into a substantial loss of
quality and product value. The main source of this type
of damage in transportation is vibration, influenced,
among others factors, by road conditions, a factor that
can be considered in the vehicle routing problem. To
address this issue, we propose a multi-objective model
that seeks to minimize the damaged products during
transport and the distance traveled by vehicles. To
evaluate the model, we examined 10 instances adapted
from the literature for the vehicle routing with time
windows. Small size instances were solved using an
augmented -constraint method (AUGMECON) and
for large size instances, we applied a non-dominated
sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II). The results
allowed us to observe the relationship between the
damaged products and the distance traveled and
showed that the proposed solution approaches are
capable of providing feasible routes considering
trade-offs between these objectives. Hence, our model
provides decision makers with a tool for an effective
determination of vehicle routes that considers the
damage that perishable food products may experience
during transport.

Vehicle routing is one of the operational decisions
in product logistics [20]. This decision is faced each
day by thousands of companies and organizations
engaged in the delivery and collection of products
[12]. Food distribution especially has additional
challenges related to transportation, in areas such as
quality, safety, and sustainability of products [2]. This
first area shows the changes throughout the supply
chain until products reach the final consumer, which
influences customer satisfaction. Additionally, during
distribution the perishable nature of food products
plays an important role in the distribution costs
because the timely delivery of these type of products
affects the delivery operator’s co stand the retailer’s
revenues [23].
Perishable food products, such as fresh fruits and
vegetables, are susceptible to mechanical damage
(bruises, cuts, punctures, abrasions) at different
stages of the distribution network: from collecting
centers to packing houses, then to distribution
centers, and finally from this centers to retailers [46].
This damage affects the product’s appearance and
increases their susceptibility to decay and the growth
of microorganisms [33], which may also increase
their chance of being rejected and ultimately wasted.
During transport, this mechanical damage is mainly
caused by vehicle vibrations, which are influenced by
various factors such as distance, speed, load, truck
characteristics, such as the suspension and number of
axles, and road roughness [6]. This last factor refers
to the superficial characteristics of the roads on which
the vehicle travels, which affects the dynamic of the
load [4, 25, 27, 57].
The natural and fast decay experienced by
perishable food and the increasing customer demands
for high-quality products, encourage the inclusion of
perishability issues in the vehicle routing problem.
In this research, we analyze the impact of perishable
products’ damage in vehicle routing. For this purpose,
we include in the problem the aforementioned damage
to which these products are susceptible during transit,
which affects the product’s quality defined not only
by the physical properties of food but also by the way
products are perceived by the consumer [21].

framework where two objectives are proposed:
minimize the total damaged products and the distance
traveled. To cope with the first objective, the model
considers a damage rate assigned according to road
conditions. To explore the proposed trade-off and deal
with the hard task of providing feasible routes, we solve
five 10-customer instances using an improved version
of the -constraint method. Afterwards, we solve five
well-known Solomon [49] instances with 50 customers
using a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm, as the
exact method fails to generate feasible solutions in
reasonable computational time.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows.
In the following section, we provide an overview of
the related literature. Section 3 and 4 describe the
methodology and the computational experiments,
respectively. The results are later analyzed in section 5.
Finally, we summarize the main findings and provide
some ideas for future research in section 6.

The vehicle routing problem (VRP) has been
widely studied in the literature. This problem in its
traditional version, known as capacitated vehicle
routing problem, seeks to determine a set of feasible
routes to satisfy a set of transportation requests at the
minimum cost given a fleet of vehicles. In its extension
that includes time windows (VRPTW) each client
service must take place within a known time interval.
For a deeper description of the properties, solutions,
methods, extensions, and applications of the vehicle
routing problem, the reader may refer to Toth and Vigo
[54]. The following review will focus on the vehicle
routing problem for the distribution of perishable
food products, mechanical damage during transport,
the modeling of road conditions and multi-objective
vehicle routing.

and penalties for time window violations. Osvald
and Stirn [40] formulate a VRPTW considering
perishability as a critical factor, where the travel
times depend on distance and time of day; this model
considers the negative effect of perishability in the
overall distribution cost, estimating the loss of quality
on the load as a function of time. Chen, Hsueh, and
Chang [10] combine the scheduling problem with
the VRPTW; in their paper, the perishable goods
have a decay rate, and their initial price is negatively
affected by the product decay when finally delivered.
Amorim and Almada-Lobo [3] present a multiobjective VRPTW that studies different scenarios
and describes the cost-freshness trade-off. To deal
with perishability, the shelf life of the most perishable
product contained in the customers’ requests is
known, and this parameter is used to maximize the
average freshness of the demanded products. Recently
Wang, Wang, Ruan, and Zhan [60] consider a VRPTW
model with the same objectives, where the loss of
freshness is calculated using a nonlinear freshness
factor; as a novelty the authors consider temporalspatial distance to solve the problem. So far, only Li,
He, Zheng, Huang, and Fan [32] have acknowledged
road conditions and their influence in the deterioration
and bruising in the distribution of fresh fruits and
vegetables. In their study, with the aim to minimize
the total cost in a VRPTW with soft time windows,
they propose a single objective model that includes a
coefficient of road surface evenness for four different
road types; this coefficient is added in the objective
function to calculate the running cost. Finally, they use
an improved genetic algorithm to solve a 12-customer
instance, and they conclude that considering road
irregularities can significantly influence total delivery
costs compared with traditional VRP models. In
contrast with the work of Li, we propose a multiobjective model with hard time windows, include
small and large size instances and use two solution
methods to solve each instance size.

LITERATURE REVIEW

Vehicle routing problem for perishable food
products
In the last several years, the distribution of perishable
food products has received special attention, and
various authors have addressed it as a vehicle routing
problem. As noted by Amorim and Almada-Lobo
[3], some of the authors focus on the distribution of
perishable food without explicitly taking into account
quality loss, degradation (loss of freshness), or decay of
products; such is the case of Tarantilis and Kiranoudis
[52, 53], who deal with the distribution of milk and
meat, and Faulin [18], who applied a procedure in a
routing problem to optimize food delivery. On the
other hand, perishability is explicitly modeled by
authors such as Hsu, Hung, and Li [23], who develop
a stochastic VRPTW dealing with the randomness
proper to the delivery of this type of product, with the
objective of minimizing the inventory, energy costs,

Mechanical damage during transport and
road conditions
The effect of vibrations during transport and the
mechanical damage that they can cause in perishable
food has been widely studied for different products,
as shown in Table 1. Several authors consider the
relationship among road conditions,vibration, and
mechanical damage in perishable food, including
Schoorl and Holt [27, 43], who propose a model to
predict the damage to horticultural products during
transport, taking into account elements such as the
road profile, tires, chassis and suspension of the
vehicle, packaging, and the cushioning of the load. In
this study, a direct relationship was observed between
the road profile and damage. Jarimopas, Singh, and
Saengnil [25] measure the vibration levels for two
different types of trucks in Thailand and their effect
show that both factors have a significant influence on
product damage. In their experiment greater damage
was caused by unpaved roads, followed by concrete
highways and then asphalt roads. Zhou, Su, Yan and
Li [62] also evaluated the effect of vibration levels on
the mechanical damage to pears under using different
road conditions such as highways, main, secondary,
tertiary, and unpaved roads. As a point to highlight,
different acceleration levels for the vibration were
obtained for different roads. Pretorius and Steyn [41]
experiment with different road conditions in Africa:
national, provincial, and gravel roads were used in
this study, which concludes that as road roughness
increases, more vibrations occur and more energy must
be absorbed by the vehicle, which can trigger more
damage to the transported products. Steyn et al. [50]
evaluate the effect of rural roads conditions on tomato
transport in California; in their research, they observe a
direct relationship between the percentage of damaged
goods, road roughness, and transportation costs. As
one of the conclusions, the authors state that damage
and failure levels can be related to road conditions for
the development of performance indicators and their
implementation in freight transport models.

Modeling road conditions
In this article, when referring to road conditions or
roughness, we refer to the unevenness of the road. The
road roughness indices are single values to evaluate
and manage road systems. These are calculated using
mathematical equations and measured road profiles.
Two very widespread internationally recognized

3
indices are the International Roughness Index (IRI)
and the ISO 8606:1995 specification index. The IRI
is the most commonly used standardized roughness
measurement and its use is more appropriate when
road roughness is looked at in relation to vehicle
operating costs, riding quality, dynamic wheel loads
and overall surface conditions [24]. The mathematical
model to obtain this index is a system of differential
equations derived from a dynamic system of masses,
spring, and dampers [31]. The ISO specification index
is obtained using the fit of a parametric function to
a measured profile’s Power Spectral Density (PSD)
(a set of distribution frequencies with accompanied
amplitudes) [31]. To a better understanding of models
for road roughness, the reader may refer to Lemken
[31], Klas and Krzysztof [29]. When examining the
influence of road conditions on cargo damage, the IRI
is used by only a few papers. Pretorius and Steyn [41]
experiment with the average IRI values of national,
provincial and gravel roads to study the damage during
transportation and Steyn et. al [50] use the IRI as a
riding quality indicator to analyze the effect of road
conditions on the potential damage to tomatoes. To do
so, once the dominant frequencies for each road types
were obtained, a laboratory simulation was executed
to show the relationship of damage percentage to
road roughness. In general, when addressing road
conditions, most of the authors obtain representative
frequencies for each road and then simulate these
frequencies in a laboratory setting [1, 22, 50].
2.4
Multi-objective vehicle routing
Because in real-life cases, most of the problems in
logistics have a multi-objective nature, the inclusion
of more than one objective in the VRP has gained
more attention in the last years. Jozefowiez, Semet
and Talbi [28] elaborated a classification of objectives
according to the components of the problem i.e. the
tour, the node/arc activity and the resources. In their
review, the most common objective related to the tour
is to minimize the cost of the solutions in terms of
distance traveled or time; other approaches include the
minimization of the makespan, tour balance and so
on. Node-related objectives include the maximization
of customer satisfaction or customer waiting times.
The most frequent resource-related objective is the
minimization of the number of vehicles as addressed
by Sivaram et al. [47].
In the last decade growing environmental
concerns regarding the economic activity has been
transferred to the field of transport and logistics.
Thus, environmental targets have been added to the
economic targets in the vehicle routing problem.
Some common objectives include minimizing the
CO2 emissions [19, 55], minimizing the emission of
air pollutants such as NOx [36], and minimizing fuel
consumption [17, 37, 42]. Regarding multi-objective
vehicle routing problems with perishable issues, only a
and Kuo [30] addresses a bi-objective model with the
purpose of minimizing total cost and balancing the
load in each vehicle.
Most of the reviewed works consider time as the
main factor in perishable food quality loss. In this
paper, we consider road conditions as a factor affecting
product quality. Thus, this study will extend the
scope into a multi-objective problem by considering
another objective corresponding to the minimization
of the damaged product. Then, the model will seek to
obtain a trade-off between the damaged products, by
minimizing the time spent in bad conditions roads,
and the distance traveled. For this purpose, unlike
the only related work including road conditions, we
rely on data found in the transportation literature
on the damaged products under three different road
conditions. Then we analyze the inclusion of this
factor on the solution structure, and, finally provide
some managerial insights.

METHODOLOGY

In the following section, we explain the notation and
model formulation for the multi-objective vehicle
routing problem considering road conditions and later
describe in detail the -constraint method and NSGAII used to respectively solve the small and large size
instances.
3.1
Notation and model formulation
This section describes a vehicle routing problem with
time windows for the distribution of a perishable
product. Road conditions and their effect on the load

are considered in the model with the inclusion of
a parameter later explained based on the results of
Jarimopas et al. [25].
The problem can be defined on a directed graph
where
denotes
the set of vertices,
the set of customers, and
represents the arc set.
The vertices and
correspond to the depot
where a homogeneous fleet of vehicles of size
with capacity is assumed to be stationed. To each
vertex
, there is an associated nonnegative
demand
, a hard time window
that represents the earliest and latest times for
service to customer to start (the depot also has a
time window corresponding to the scheduling horizon
of the problem), and non-negative service times
. Associated with each arc there
is a distance
and a travel time
that represents
the time it takes the vehicle to travel from to .
A damage rate
that indicates the ratio of damage
produced per load unit per unit of time is associated
equals
to each arc. The binary decision variable
1 if vertex is traversed after by the vehicle and
indicates the start of service
otherwise. Variable
of vehicle at vertex . Finally, an auxiliary variable
is added to accumulate the percentage of damaged
products delivered at the vertex , the initial damage
is considered to be zero
.
According to the given notation, the mathematical
formulation can be stated as follows:

The objective function (1) minimizes the
accumulated damaged products along the routes. The
objective function (2) minimizes the distance covered
by the vehicle. Constraints (3) state that each customer
is visited by exactly one vehicle. Constraints in (4)
indicate that the vehicles must start from the depot.
The flow conservation in each vertex is ensured by
constraints (5), while time windows are enforced
through constraints (6) and (7). Regarding the vehicle
capacity, constraints in (8) force it to be respected by
not allowing the sum of the demands on a given route
to exceed it. The set of constraints in (9) accumulates

the damage of the products for each client based on the
previously traveled arcs. The constraints in (10) and
(11) avoid all the accumulated damaged percentage
of products per client to exceed the demand of each
client. Finally, constraints from (11) to (13) define the
domains of the remaining decision variables. Figure
1 illustrates the parameters of the problem. In the
Figure, road conditions are assigned to each arc. In
this particular solution, formed by the routes D-5-31-D and D-2-4-D, the dashed lines show the parts of
the route in which the damage to products takes place.

To explore the proposed trade-off, first, an exact
method is used to solve the 10 customer instances.
Afterwards, the model is tested in large size instances
by employing an approximate method. This will allow
us to obtain the set of equally important solutions for
each problem.
3.2.1 Small-size instances
To solve the 10-customer instances, we employ an
improved version of the -constraint method, which
is one of the best-known methods to solve multiobjective problems [13]. It basically consists of
creating a single-objective model where only one of
the objective functions will be optimized, and the
remaining functions become constraints in the model
[16]. The AUGMECON method is an improved version
of the -constraint method that avoids the production
of weakly Pareto optimal solutions and also redundant
iterations [34]. This method is applied for 10-customer
instances as follows:
Step 1. Create a payoff table to obtain the range
of each one of the
objectives. This is
done by optimizing each objective individually
and finding the values of the other objective
functions at this optimal point. Then, the range
corresponds to the interval between the ideal
and the worst value. To overcome the ambiguity
of obtaining non-Pareto optimal solutions
under the presence of alternative optima the
use of lexicographic optimization for every
objective function is used.
Step 2. Choose one objective function
as the main objective and transform the others
into constraints.
Step 3. Divide the range of each th objective
equal intervals using
function into
equidistant step points.
Step 4. Solve the AUGMECON mathematical
model in equation (13) separately for each
combination of step points in the objective
function. In the model
is a small number
usually between
and
, where is
the feasiblearea of the original problem, is a
slack variable for the objective function , and
is the length of the objective function’s range.
(14)

To solve the 10 customer instances, we decided to
optimize
and transform
into a constraint. Then,
according to (13), our problem becomes:
(15)

To perform step 3, the range of was divided into
a 100 equal intervals. Algorithm 1 shows the pseudocode to find the Pareto front with the AUGMECON
method. In it the values
and
represent the
theoretical worst and best values for the first objective,
respectively. These values are shown in Table 2 per
instance for all the objectives.

3.2.2. Large-size instances
To test the model in larger size instances we employ
a non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGAII). This algorithm has been used in several multiobjective VRP variants [3, 9, 26, 35] and widely
applied in different problems, showing competitive
results when compared to other multi-objective
evolutionary algorithms [15]. The readers are refereed
to Deb, Agrawal, Pratap, and Meyarivan [14] for more
details on the NSGA-II. The NSGA-II structure is

3.2.2.2 Evaluation and decoding.
Because the order of serving customers in a
chromosome may lead to infeasible routes, the
evaluation was designed to not let solutions violate any
constraint. The evaluation starts assigning customers
to routes in the permutation order. When a customer
cannot be served in the route, because of capacity or
time windows violations, a new route is created. In
Figure 3 customers 1 and 2 can be sequentially served
and form a route leaving customers 5, 4 and 3, which
can be sequentially served, into the next route.

To represent a solution, we use a permutation encoding
where every chromosome is a string of numbers
from 1 to the number of customers representing the
sequence in which they are assigned to the routes.
Figure 3 shows the solution representation. The initial
population of size N is randomly generated.

3.2.2.3 Selection and elitism.
To rank the population in the algorithm, we implement
two operators called fast non-dominated sorting and
crowding distance [14]. After the population is ranked,
according to a fitness equal to its non-domination
level, a binary tournament selection takes place. In this
tournament, two individuals are randomly selected
and their ranks compared. Then the individual with
lower rank is selected. In case the solutions belong to
the same front, the solution with the greater crowded
distance is chosen.
3.2.2.4 Crossover.
After two chromosomes are randomly selected
as parents, they are crossed by employing an
specialized operator known as “Best Route Cost
Route Crossover”(BCRC), which looks forward
simultaneously tominimize the number of vehicles
and distance while checking feasibility constraints
[39, 47].To execute this operator, first one random
route is selected from each parent, and then the
customers in each chosen route are removed from the
opposite parent to create the offspring, as shown in
Figure 4, (part a). Next, each removed customer in the
route is reinserted in the best feasible position (the one
resulting in total minimum cost routes) to create the
offspring. If no feasible insertion is found for a given

COMPUTATIONAL EXPERIMENTS

In order to perform the computational experiments, as
previously mentioned, we will use small and large size
instances. The first group of small instances will allow
us to observe the existence of the trade-off and easily
analyze the impact on the solution structure. On the
other hand, we test five large Solomon [49] instances
under four different scenarios (road combinations) to
further analyze the impact of road conditions in the
VRPTW.
For all instances, to relate the damage in the load
with the road conditions, we used the results by
Jarimopas et al. [25], who obtained the average
damage percentage per load unit for two vehicle types
in three road conditions corresponding to laterite,
asphalt, and concrete roads. From these results we
selected the average damage percentage in the two-ton
truck at a speed of
for the three different road
conditions. Then, the average damage was divided by
30 minutes, corresponding to the time at which the
author conducted his experiment for each combination
of speed and road condition, to obtain a rate in terms
of time that we denominated . Table 3 shows the
average damage per load unit percentages [25] and
the
for each road type. Finally, in every instance
according to the road types present and considering
that finding a specific road is equally probable, a
damage rate was associated to each arc.

In the following, we report on results for the small,
and large size instances, respectively.
4.1
Small-size instances
Due to the absence of instances from the literature for
this problem (with the inclusion of road types), and with
the aim to validate the model, we proceeded to create
new small size instances based on the ones proposed
by Solomon for the VRPTW. Because the minimum
number of customers in Solomon’s instances is 25,
to create each 10-customer instance, the number of
needed customers was randomly selected from the 25
customer instances following a uniform distribution.
Table 4 shows the selected 25-customer instances and
the customers per instance.

The small instances were solved using the
AUGMECON method. For each 10-customer
instances, 100 runs were performed by changing the
values according to the different ranges. The MIP
model for all the instances was coded in GAMS 23.6
and optimally solved (0% GAP) with the solver CBC
on a notebook with an Intel Dual I3 4005U processor
at 1.7 GHz and 4 GB RAM running Windows 10
Home. Figure 7 shows the results for all 10-customer
instances. The obtained graphs allow us to observe a
conflict between the objectives and show the tradeoff between delivering fewer damaged products
and traveling shorter distances, under different road

To exemplify the change in the solution structure
Figure 8 shows solutions for instance 1 in three cases:
a) when the distance is minimized , b) when there is a
trade-off between the objectives and c) when damage
is minimized. It can be noted that, unlike a), solutions
b) and c) select alternate arcs in order to avoid long
bad conditions roads. As a result both solutions yield
an increase in distance. Additionally, more routes are
observed in c) than in cases a) or b).

Large-size instances
Instances C101, C202, R204, RC206, and C206 were
randomly selected for evaluation. After, the NSGAII was coded in MATLAB 2014a, and each instance
was executed according to the parameters in Table
5. To select the crossover and mutation rates, we rely
on the literature where this problem has been tested,
showing good results with high crossover rates and
low mutation rates [39, 47]. To choose the population
size, tests were executed changing the population from
100 to 350 using a 50 individuals step.

Each instance was executed for four different
scenarios characterized by different road combinations
as shown in Table 6. That is, the quantity of damaged
products in every scenario is expected to be different.
In scenario 1, each road type has a participation of one
third of all arcs. Scenarios 2, 3, and 4 are formed by
combinations of two road types, each of which has 50%
of the arcs. As shown in our experiment, no scenario
including only one type of road was considered.This is
because when the roads are homogeneous (one type),
the problem becomes a classical VRPTW. In that case,
time could be considered the main factor influencing
perishability. Each scenario was executed three times,

Table 7 shows the average values for both objectives
in each scenario for all 50-customer instances. It
is possible to observe that, for every instance, less
damage takes place in scenario 2, where roads are
formed by a combination of asphalt and concrete
roads. In contrast, scenario 4 showed the highest
average damage corresponding to the combination of
laterite and concrete roads. On average, the damaged

products increased 111% when changing from scenario
2 to scenario 4 for all instances. Thus, we can say that
the road conditions play an important role in the final
number of damaged products. Regarding scenarios
1 and 3, in four of five instances scenario 3 showed
less damaged products, only in instance C202 was the
average damage greater in scenario 1 than scenario 3.
Finally, it can be noted that distances values between
the best an worst scenario (from left to right) are
similar in each instance, but the number of damaged
products increases according to the road combination
of each scenario.
These results can also be observed in Figure 9 where
equally efficient solutions per instance and scenario
are shown, providing diverse useful alternatives to the
decision maker. The difference in damage among the
given scenarios can be easily observed because the
Pareto fronts from lesser to greater damage go from

MANAGERIAL IMPLICATIONS

It is possible to analyze the results from two
perspectives: an economic perspective, where a penalty
on the price for the damaged products can take place to
quantify the effect in the total cost, and another where
the damage could be seen as an intangible measure of
customer satisfaction. In the first case, we could assign
a coefficient to the first objective to quantify the cost
of delivering damaged products. In the second case,
because we want to maximize customer satisfaction, it
would be equivalent to minimizing damaged products,
which the first objective naturally does.
The first case might depend on parameters like the
penalty percentage
on the product’s price for
the incurred damage and the product’s price
. It
is also possible to calculate the cost for the traveled
distance by including a constant
representing the
transportation cost per kilometer, which will allow us

to obtain the participation of the damage in the total
cost. As an example, let’s consider the parameters in
Table 8 and the solutions for all instances under three
different cases like the ones in Figure 8 (minimum
distance, minimum damage, and a trade-off). Given
those parameters, the economic loss due to damaged
products can be calculated according to (15). Table 9
shows the related costs under cases a, b, and c for all
instances. For the following analysis, we used scenario
1 (with the participation of the three road types) for
50-customer instances.

As seen in Table 9 the damaged products are greater in
the 50-customer instances than 10-customer instances.
Nevertheless, the average participation in the total
transportation cost (damage loss and distance cost) is
similar, being 13% and 17% for 10-and 50-customer
instances, respectively. When addressed from an

economic perspective, because both objectives are
in cost terms, the problem reduces to finding the
minimum cost, which can be done by calculating the
costs in all the solutions on the Pareto front set using

Table 10: Damage reduction and distance increase

It is more suitable to analyze the proposed tradeoff from a customer satisfaction perspective. In this
case, it is useful to take into account the percentage
of damaged-product reduction when the trade-off is
considered, in order to compare it with the increase
in traveled distance. For example, Table 10 shows
the percentage of damage reduction and increase of
distance when changing from scenario to . Then, as
an example, it is up to the decision maker in instance
3 whether to sacrifice a 12.7% increase over the
minimum distance to gain a 4% reduction in damage.
The trade-off is likely to be accepted when greater
damage reduction is achieved rather than a case, such
in instance 5 where a large increase in distance resulted
in little change to damage. To ease the decision, a
manager could consider to accepting the trade-off
under certain situations, like when the reduction and
increase are greater or less than a percentage.
Regarding the average damage for 10-and
50-customer instances the percentage of damaged
products in relation to the total demand is shown in
Table 11. There we can observe that there is not a
wide difference in the average percentage of damaged
load for the different instance sizes. However, the
10-customer instances showed a slightly greater (1.4%)
average percentage of damaged load than 50-customer
instances.
Solomon’s instances are clustered in six classes
[39] C1, C2, R1, R2, RC1, and RC2. C-categorized
problems are clustered geographically or according to
time windows. Problems in category R have customer
locations uniformly distributed, and RC instances
have a hybrid nature. In addition problems C1, R1
and RC1 have narrow time windows. Considering
this classification, clustered instances (C and RCtype) showed less average damage percentage than
the R204 instance. Similarly, the evaluated instance
with narrow time windows (C101) showed less average
damage than instances of type C2, R2 and RC2, which
have wider time windows.

CONCLUSIONS

In this paper, the authors proposed a model for a vehicle
routing problem that deals with the distribution of a
perishable product. The model addressed two distinct
objectives: the minimization of damaged products and
the minimization of the distance traveled. To achieve
the first objective, the damage caused during transit
under different road conditions was considered based
on data found in the literature. The inclusion of this
factor is relevant due to the products’ perishability and
the effects thatmechanical damage may have on the
consumer-perceived quality.
To cope with the stated multi-objective problem,
first five 10-customer instances from the literature
were adapted and then solved using the AUGMECON
method. Because the employed exact solution method
presented limitations by not being able to find efficient
solutions for large-size instances in reasonable time,
five large Solomon instances were solved using an
evolutionary algorithm. The results allowed us to
observe trade-offs between the objectives and show
that the proposed solutions methods are capable
of finding sets of equally efficient solutions for the
problem. For large instances, four different scenarios
were explored. As a result, scenario 2 where only
asphalt and concrete roads are present, showed the least
damaged products. The results were analyzed from
two perspectives: the economic, where the damage was
quantified in terms of costs and expressed in relation
with the transportation cost, and a perspective when
the proposed trade-off is more suitable, where the
perishable nature of the product is highly important to
the planner in order to improve customer satisfaction.
In general, the proposed model could be used
on a small scale when products are transported to
wholesale distributors, factories, distribution centers,
the mentioned trade-off will depend on the extend
to which the decision-maker is willing to improve
customer satisfaction.
The application of the model in real life is limited by
the available information on the road conditions and
the associated mechanical damage to the products, as
well as by the study of the effects of different factors
on damage during transport. Future work shall be
devoted to ascertaining the damage to different kinds
of perishable food products under different road
conditions and to better understand damage-causing
factors such as vehicle speed, vehicle characteristics,
and packaging, to ease their consideration on the
vehicle routing problem. Finally, further research
could focus on the resolution of larger instances of
the problem and the development of variants to the
