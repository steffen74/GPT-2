these changes are not adequate to ensure organizations sustainable development (Hart &
Milstein, 1999; Senge & Carstedt, 2001). To face the social and environmental challenges,
organizations should undertake a cultural change and sustainable structural transformation
(Post & Altman, 1994; Stead & Stead, 1992; Welford, 1995). Organizations must
implement a culture of sustainability if they plan to implement organizational change that
ensures business sustainability (Crane, 1995).
Brief and others believe that sustainable change can only occur if implementing a new
organizational climate and culture that lead to a better performance than in the past.
Changing the organizational climate is an important step in the process of changing
company’s employees’ values and beliefs. In fact, these beliefs and values form the
organization's culture. (Brief and others, 1996, p.16)
Pasmore and others show that, in shaping an organization, an important role is played by
implemented management practices (Pasmore and others, 2009). Understanding the role of
organization top management is an important contribution to any organizational change
theory focused on improving social, environmental, and competitive performance (Iacob
and other, 2009). Linnenluecke and Griffiths state that an important research direction is
provided by the complexity of relationships between organizational culture and
organizational sustainability. (Linnenluecke and Griffiths, 2010, p 364). They also assert
that the change of organizational culture can be an important driving of organizational
change in all respects: economic, social and environmental.
Our research proceeded from the review of organizational change, culture management, and
sustainability literature and direct observation of OMV Petrom organizational change
characteristics. The research can be classified as exploratory, representing an initial study
that deals with the issue of organizational change in terms of ensuring a sustainable
organization. The choice of OMV Petrom was based on the numerous changes experienced
by this national company, along with privatization and its transition to a responsible
company.
1. Models of organizational change
Organizational change specialists have proposed several ways of intervention to operate
change in a company: organizational development programs, management by objectives,
social and technical approach, improved reward systems, Total Quality Management
(TQM), etc. Woldring thinks that substantial organizational change works best if the
change is phased (Woldring, 2010, pp.5-10):
 Preliminary Phase, problem identification, involves the detection of abnormalities in
the structure and organization’s life, resulting in reduced functionality and low efficiency of
organizational activity;
 Data collection, analysis and diagnosis;
 Get agreement on the change;
 Implement organizational change;
 Assess and improve organizational change plan.
Brief and others introduced the concept of total organizational change, assuming that
successful organizational change is achieved only if organizational environment and culture

1996, pp.8-9)
 creating organizational framework for implementing the corporate change,
 analyzing the proposed change taking into account four variables: human relations,
hierarchical relations, labor relations, reward system configuration,
 detailed planning of measures for total organizational change,
 reconfiguring the rewards system, to ensure employees total support to
organizational change plan,
 allocating resources to implement the total organizational change,
 close monitoring of plan fulfillment.
Based on these steps, we built an integrative model that apply organizational change phases
(problems identification, data collection, analysis, and diagnosis, agreement on change,
organizational change implementation plan, assess and improve organizational change
plan) to components of culture management (values, norms, rules).
Integrative model of organizational change process mixed with culture management is
based on Plan, Do, Check, Act (PDCA – Plan-Implement-Verify-Act for this specific case)
Deming’s cycle of quality continuous improvement. Implementing this model without
achieving an effective integration could cause confusion, inconsistency and incompatibility
(Figure no. 1).

the requirements, responsibilities and resources for changing each value, norm and rule,
which does not correspond to an organizational culture focused on sustainability.
Implementation phase (DO) involves the plans implementation.
Verification phase (CHECK) involves comparing the standards set in the first phase with
achieved results to determine the level of objectives' fulfillment.
Acting phase (ACT) requires readjustment of plans in order to achieve adequately the
objectives.
The benefits of both this approach and the model we developed are the “red threads” among
model’s various components, whose integrated implementation leads to achieving
organizational goals.
2. Achieving sustainability in OMV Petrom trough organizational change process
Petrom is the largest South-Eastern European producer of oil and natural gas, combining
experience of the first oil producing country with international knowledge of OMV, the
leading oil company in Central Europe.
The company's main activities are:
 Exploration and Production,
 Refining oil and Gas,
 Marketing.
Company’s top management efforts were devoted to undoubted change Petrom into a
company socially responsible, involved in various areas of social development. As an
integrated oil and gas company, currently with over 20,000 employees, influencing and
affecting the lives of many people through its business operations, OMV Petrom is focused
on preserving and improving the environment it activates in. OMV Petrom change into a
modern company dedicated to development and improvement would not have been possible
without the strong commitment of employees.
Activities development is supported by significant investments aimed at improving efficiency
and increasing production. Appropriate corporate governance and social responsibility high
standards are the cornerstones of social sustainability culture. The company aims to become
not only a model in the business community, but also a responsible "citizen" of the
community it operates in. Another company's objective is focused on reducing the impact of
climate changes through growing energy efficiency and reducing carbon emissions, by
implementing highest quality environmental standards. (OMV Petrom, 2012)
OMV Petrom integrated sustainable development issues in business development strategy.
Sustainable development is the way in which OMV Petrom prioritizes health, safety,
security, environment, community relations and social issues. The analysis of sustainable
development indicators underlines that although environmental and social costs have
increased the responsible policy led to a positive trend of financial indicators (Table no. 1).
Organizational change process initiated by and inside OMV Petrom, along with company
privatization, had impressive results, the total turnover of Petrom OMV represented in 2011
more than 5% of Romania’s GDP.

company. As a responsible industrial company, OMV Petrom is committed to support the
efficient and appropriate use of energy sources, taking into account current customers and
future generations’ needs and interest in terms of environment protection.

future generations to meet their own needs. Consequently, OMV should consider as part of
its business approach, the means and tools to produce and ensure long-term energy supplies
while ensuring a balance among environmental, social and economic grounds. (OMV
Petrom, 2012)
Functional strategies of Sustainability Strategy for 2015 ensure a balanced development
from economic, environmental and social points of view. OMV Petrom annual program of
sustainability provides a consolidated overview of company’s performance during the
reporting period, in eight areas: (OMV, 2011, p 8)

community relations.

In 2011, OMV Petrom continued the process of promotion and implementation of
performance-based culture. In this respect, OMV Petrom has developed and communicated,
internally and externally, the strategy up to 2015. It also continued with the other initiatives
on performance: emphasize positive communication, consider team's development
objectives as important as business objectives, implement a robust performance
management, design a process and programs of talent management and to eliminate
deficiencies in communication between headquarters and offices around the world. (OMV,
2011, p 42)
To assess performance and configure a rewards system OMV Petrom introduced an
effective MBO system (Management by Objectives) as a continuous process based on
defining goals and assessing managers’ performance related to the objectives. This led to a
more efficient management for both managers and employees, and to a better integration
and alignment to OMV Petrom group general objectives.
The ultimate goal of these programs is the sustainable development and creation of a
unified corporate culture based on transparency and performance.
3. Adapting the integrative change model at OMV Petrom case
To ensure sustainable development, OMV Petrom intends to diversify its energy sources
and find solutions to reduce fossil fuel use impact on climate. Therefore, OMV Petrom
builds a strategy called "3plus". The three levels of strategy are (OMV, 2011, p 8): three
business segments (Exploration and Production, Gas and Power and Refining and
Marketing); three markets (CEE, SEE and Turkey); three values (Professionalism,
Pioneering, Partners).
To support and promote this operational strategy, OMV Petrom has defined a set of
operational strategies: health, safety, security, environment, community relations, social

sustainability, the company awards bonuses in reward system.
Analyzing the main synthetic indicators illustrating OMV Petrom road to sustainability, we
mentioned a considerable extension of the turnover and granted rewards, while increasing
work safety and reducing negative environmental impact (Table no. 2).

In parallel, to increase OMV Petrom employees’ awareness and accountability, we
proposed the application of an integrated system that combines phases of organizational
change with stages of management by objectives. This integrated system will be reinforced
(strengthened) by PDCA cycle of quality continuous improvement of processes, values and
rules of organization (Figure no. 3).

Such a system, which we have titled Continuous Organizational Change System (COCS),
can ensure sustainable development under increased social responsibility and continuous
awareness of environmental issues.
Conclusions and further research
Organizational change occurs within the companies that build new organizational climates
and cultures. There is no recipe for success in terms of culture or organizational climate
entailing change. Only organizational climate and culture accepted by all stakeholders will
generate sustainable organizational change.
Top management is responsible for initiating and managing organizational change. At
OMV Petrom, change began when the company's management turned from the public to
private, reaching a high level when the company chose to change to a sustainable policy.
The change took a long time, assuming enormous financial and social efforts. The change

itself into a responsible company, competitive and profitable.
This paper presents a model of organizational change to increase organizational
sustainability. Model provides an overview of organizational change plans, change
components under the conditions of adapting organizational culture to sustainability policy.
The paper concludes with recommendations for implementing a system of organizational
changes within the company OMV Petrom in terms of sustainable development objectives.
The approach covers the PDCA cycle and provides a logical and objective path for the
organizational change to achieve the goals in organizational sustainability area.
The paper indicates a number of areas for further research. The next step is to consider the
role of leadership in organizational change. Moreover, research is needed to explore and
identify what happens when organizational change is used within organization as a mean
and tool for behavior, values and processes continuous improvement to ensure
sustainability.
