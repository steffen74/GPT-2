2005, p. 87). Therefore, the change becomes necessary, inevitable and furthermore is a process
of adaptation and evolutionary potential for each person, organization and / or society.
In an era of information and communication technology, organizational changes are imminent
for the organizations survival playing an important role in their own adaptation to extremely
rapid technological development (Turban and McLean, 2009, pp.38-39).
The experience shows that organizational change is associated with sustainability at macro
level and durable development at micro level. In essence, the process of change targets
society as a whole, organizations and people as functional units (Leca, 1999, p. 39) or,
according to another approach, the person and only after, the group / organization (Nica,
2006, p. 2).
At the organizational level, change can be perceived not only as an opportunity, but also as
a threat. Seen as an opportunity, the change is a chance for an organization to eliminate an
unsatisfactory situation. When the current situation is generally satisfactory, the change can
become a threat because it can endanger the privileged position which is intended to be
maintained.
Change is related to modification occurred in goals, plans and structure, motivation and
control systems (Kotter, 2006, pp. 89-90) and it has three vectors of action: competitive
environment control, strengthening of human potential, continuous improvement processes.
The potential factors of the organizational change are internal, external, political, economic,
technological and socio-cultural in their paramount concern with the environment. Here is
the context in which organizational change is inconceivable without enterprise’s
sustainability. (Dinu, 2010, pp. 5-7; Dinu, 2011, pp. 6-7).
As a concept, sustainability has different meanings. Thus, some authors (Cândea, 2011, p.2)
believe that an organization is sustainable if it operates as so to protect the environment, often
being called “green”. In the view of other authors (Lubin and Esty, 2010, pp.9-10), the
sustainability is proven by the social responsibility of the company, which must be
manifested and sustained by socially responsible investment, that organization seeks to
respond to complex performance criteria, including extra financial nature, criteria that relate
to the environmental management and resolution of problems in the social sphere.
1. Objectives, hypotheses and research methodology
1.1 Objectives
The main objective of our applied research was to outline the implementation of change
management in the IT&C Romanian SMEs environment and their perception manner
concerning the changes rationality and operationality, to ensure the viability and the
organizational sustainability.
We chose the approach of applied research to be performed by initiating organizational
change at the managerial level, given the fact that the improvement opportunity in this
direction has recently won, an increasing important role in SMEs (Barbu and Nedelea, 2005, p.
25) both as an academic subject and as an issue for empirical area.(Popescu, Chivu, Scarlat et
al., 2010, pp. 49-50).

Main hypothesis: The perception manner of entrepreneurs / managers concerning the rationality
and implementation of change management in IT& C SMEs influences direct and positive the
organizational performance.
The three secondary hypotheses, relevant for the role played by the organizational change in
obtaining sustainable economic performances are:
 Entrepreneurs / managers of SMEs do not adopt a consistent approach of change
management based on the rationality, designing and implementation of some strategies in
order to achieve change at the organizational level;
 Organizational change processes are initiated usually ad hoc, depending on current
issues, without being based on coherent plans of action, which jeopardize the sustainability of
IT&C SMEs;
 The approach of change management in IT&C SMEs is punctual and reactive, being
determined, in most cases, by the specific character of certain projects in progress.
We decided that after testing the three hypoteses to build a specific model to include a
constructive approach of change management in IT&C SMEs, the applicable approaches
taken in the context of the economy based on knowledge and also economic and social
sustainability.
In terms of design, the research was a combination of a random stratified survey with unequal
probabilities (Isaic-Maniu, Mitruţ and Voineagu, 2004, pp. 226-238) and a conducted half
random survey (Filip, Spătaru and Mircea, 2002, pp. 178-184), which was imposed by
organizational reasons regarding the restrictions and limitations of such research made by one
person.
1.3 Research methodology
The methodology used was a logical consequence of the questions used in the research as a
first step in choosing the quantitative / qualitative approach. For our study, the key
question used was: To what extent, the way and the implementation degree of change
management in SMEs operating in the IT&C sector, causes increased organizational,
economic and financial performance?
We conducted the data collection phase with the organization phase and ongoing
of interviews. To obtain the necessary research, we have chosen two modes of action,
namely:
 activity on the field (personal administration of questionnaires to managers and / or
entrepreneurs of organizations);
 sending questionnaires online or by mail, using the contact details of SME
(we used the database of the National Council of Small and Medium Enterprises in Romania CNIPMMR).

Regarding the statistical survey, we have chosen SMEs which have been the sample’s
survey respecting the principle of rational choice, communities being structured in typical
groups, according to a predetermined criteria.
In order to obtain recoil border between quality and quantity and also improvement of the
link between these areas, a considerable potential was provided by turning to lexical
analysis technique, through which we could accomplish quantification of qualitative, trend
aimed to improve decisions in the areas defined through quality standards, by obtaining
objective analysis.With this purpose, we have included in the questionnaire, open questions
whose answers have been processed along with other existing texts, mainly those concerning
organizational change and its management and leadership.
Sample representativeness was ensured mainly not so much by its size, as the following
characteristics non-alternative on which was determined: the main activity and number of
employees. Furthermore, to compensate for possible errors, we applied the methods to improve
further stratification by successive recalibration.
The interviews had well defined goals as a starting point, which were both theoretical and
pragmatic.
Some of the theoretical objectives were: conducting interviews on change-performance
approach that would complement the main research tool: the questionnaire, highlighting
managers' opinion on the changing attitudes of the organization employees, identifying
aspects of human motivation for work.
As pragmatic objectives, we pursued: identifying the awareness of respondents, the concept
of change management, identifying the forces which causes greater resistance to change
from managers (who initiates the change) and employees (those who are subject of change),
making recommendations for managers in using elements that determine the change in the
organization.
At the base of the interview’s design was the hypothesis under which the employees capacity to
notice, to resist or to facilitate the changes in the work processes, is vital for the organizational
performance.
The questionnaire included closed questions, with general character, allowing immediate
response formulation. The second part of the questionnaire was limited to issues related to
SME profitability of IT&C area and their economic performance, and the third, the changeperformance relationship. Research hypotheses, such as the conclusions, are also in close
interdependence with the responses of second and third parts of the survey.
First of all, we obtained the validation of questionnaire based on core values of the survey
results. We sent the original version of the questionnaire, the pilot study by SMEs in
Bucharest, to receive feedback on the accuracy of questions. After completing the
questionnaire, we asked respondents feedback. A revised version of research instruments was
sent to all pre-established SMEs in the sample.
When we made the survey statistics, we have established the general collectivity researched
as being the ensemble of active SMEs in the IT & C area based in Romania, which compiled
and submitted the balance in 2010 in evidence and national statistics for Romania.

Despite the prevalence of IT& C products that are core business for most of the SMEs surveyed
(61.1%), we find an adequate representation of other branches of the IT & C, intended to
provide heterogeneity to the areas of activity studied in the sample.
Statistical instruments
Data obtained were analyzed using Statistical Packages for Social Scientists (SPSS) 16.0.
Given the large amount of information, the results are summarized.
Since the main indicators of central tendency are arithmetic mean, standard deviation and
coefficient of variation, plus auxiliary statistical indicators, we determined the weighted
average ( x ), respecting the imposed frequency distribution by variants of the questionnaire
response.

Since data obtained from interviews differ significantly, depending on the criteria for
classification of SMEs, we calculated partial averages for each type of collectivity. Partial
averages (also called moving averages) were used in the situation of large fluctuations in the
string values, for which the trend is hard to estimate. The calculation is mediating a number m of
attached values:

x glis , m 

x i  2  xi 1  x i  x i  1  x i  2

Standard deviation (σ) is calculated as the mean square of elements at their main value:
σ=

This indicator is relevant by raising the square deviation. We gave more importance to the
absolute deviation affecting in large extent, the degree of variation in the analyzed
variables.
Coefficient of variation (v) is calculated as the ratio between standard deviation and
arithmetic mean, values of this indicator being subunit:
v =   100
x

(4)

The closer value of v is to zero, the lower the variation is getting.Thus, the collectivity
is homogeneous, and the arithmetic mean has a high degree of representativeness. The greater
the value of v is, the more intense the variation is getting. Consequently, the collectivity is
heterogeneous, and the arithmetic mean has a lower significance level.
2. Research results
We will present, further, the most important research results, focusing on basic characteristics
and detailed secondary correlations (table no. 4).

The high amplitude (110) is correlated with high levels of dispersion (374,278) and standard
deviation. To reflect the SMEs in the level of turnover, we made a series of unequal intervals of
small values initially reduced length intervals and subsequently increased, the upper axis values.
In the interpretation of primary data obtained by the questionnaire, bivariate analysis assumed
considering the variables involved, in pairs. Given the research hypotheses, and the objectives of
the study, we considered the following pairs of variables (table no.5):
 change management forms used by managers within the organization, in
correspondence with the frequency of application;
 change management forms used by managers within the organization, in
correspondence with the intensity of application.

Testing Hypothesis 1 from statistical processing of data:
Hypothesis1: Entrepreneurs / managers of SMEs do not adopt a consistent approach to change
management based on the design, development and implementation of strategies in order to
achieve organizational change.
In figure no. 1 we presented the absolute frequencies, highlighting the high dispersion and
low frequencies, to the extreme right of values.
Absolute frequency histogram for implementing change management shows a strong
scattering for the values of change forms frequencies, demonstrating their heterogeneity.
Histogram chart type shows a high level of:
 economic forms of change (the maximum is reached between 5-6);
 level of changing shape intensity, which decreases as the number of constantly type
approaches increases.
We concluded that between forms of change and organizational performance is a direct,
positive relationship.

Testing the main hypothesis: statistical regression and the method of least squares:
The main hypothesis: The perception of entrepreneurs / managers on the rationality and
implementation of change management in SMEs in the IT & C area influence, direct and
positive organizational performance.
In order to apply regression, the data series were noted as follows:
Y = economic and financial performance achieved by the organization
X= properly, consistently and at an appropriate intensity application of change management
Following the introduction of data series in the E-Views, by importing from Excel, we
defined Aplicatia1.wf file that contains variables Y, X, c (coefficients vector) and resid
(residues vector).
Simple regression model that we propose in this application is:
Y = α + β* X + ε
Next, we determined the nature of the two variables (X and Y), variables that compose the
regression equation and are necessary for estimation of regression models. Data from series
are expressed in real terms. We analyzed descriptive data series and, following a parameter
estimation of the first regression model using a number of 35 iterations, we obtained the
following values of coefficients α and β:
Y = 438.1614 + 1.375421* X
(91.56818)

(0.010994)

Positive sign of regression coefficient (1.375421) shows a direct link between the application
of change management and organizational performance by managers and entrepreneurs. Its
value must be interpreted as follows: increasing with a unit the intensity of change management
application, the attached financial and economic performance of the organization increases, on
average, with 1.375421 units. Constant term has a value of 438.1614 and expresses the value
of gross domestic product, where private consumption would be zero (table no. 6):

The results were interpreted econometric, as follows:
Results testing
To check the significance of estimators obtained by applying simple linear regression model,
we applied the t Test:
 For the free term α we have:
H0 : α = 0
H1 : α ≠ 0
From Table no. 8 result estimations, in OLS sense, namely: the estimated value of the
parameter α is 438.1614, the standard deviation of 91.56818, and the test statistic value is
4.785084. Since the marginal level of significance (p-value) is less than 0.05 (in our case, is
0.0000), we will reject the null hypothesis, under which free term is zero. In conclusion, the
free term is significantly different from zero.
 For the β term we have :
H0 : β = 0
H1 : β ≠ 0

From the summary table we concluded that the estimated value for β parameter is
1.375421, with standard deviation of 0.010994 in OLS sense, and test statistics value is
125.1112. As marginal significance level is very close to zero, we accept the alternative
hypothesis, which ensure us that the parameter β is significantly different from zero. By
checking the significance of estimators obtained by OLS, results that they are significantly
different from zero.
Analysis of variance for simple regression model
In simple linear regression model we expressed linearly dependent variable Y and consequently,
we assessed whether variations in the variable X affects +'s values change. For values of
independent variable X, we can determine the deviation from the average range. Or, otherwise
stated, we can determine the total variation corresponding to variable Y. Using total variance
decomposition rule, we get:
Total variance = variance explained by the X values + variance unexplained by the model
Taking into account the appropriate degrees of freedom, we applied the F statistic (FisherSnedecor). For the regression model considered, it appears that value of F statistics is
15652.80 and marginal significance level is very low (0.000000), which leads to the
conclusion that β ≠ 0.
A qualitative indicator of the regression model is the coefficient of determination (R-squared ).
Its values close to 1 means that the variable Y variations are explained by variations in the
variable X. As the value of the determination coefficient is 0.997896, results that the model does
not adjust well the sample data.
As a result of estimation parameters, the mathematical model describing the relationship
between the two indicators analyzed can be represented as:
Y = 438.1614 + 1.375421* X
(91.56818) (0.010994)
Based on the results we found that between the variables Y and X there is a significant
positive linear dependence, and also that the regression slope is positive and significantly
different from zero.
Correlation between the two indicators is justified by defining the simple regression model,
while econometric analyzes performed on these models shows that indicator values fall within
the ranges for which is confirmed the link between the two variables.
In our opinion, calling for the implementation of change management strategies is, in most
cases, punctual and retroactive, not proactive and systemic.
Finally, we propose a potential model for achieving organizational change in SMEs from IT&C
area, as those given in figure no. 4.

Phase 1 show that change is an essential condition for the sustainability of the organization,
change management being an integral part of strategic management and, thus, causing strategy
and viability of the company.
The following steps will demonstrate the added value that this integration it provides, as
follows:
Phase 2 illustrates how organizational strategy must include and be adapted to change
strategy. In this phase it is also demonstrated the importance of human resources and
leadership in this process.
Phase 3 opens a series of three verifications (checkings) and signals of difficult situations.
In case of direct contact, change management specialists can check: if employees and / or
intermediate communities understand organizational strategy or understood strategy is
implemented. In both cases, change management may enter into strategic management
feedback process containing this information.

Phase 4 analyzes the key positions in the communities of employees and journalists. In
convergent communities, in particular, these positions are occupied by opinion leaders.
While in Phase 3, the feedback was direct and personal at this stage it becomes more general
and empirical. The selection process and the one of monitoring the news / comments in the
press can be very useful leadership. In this context, in-house research studies can be used for
employees, etc.
Phase 5 aims to target all communities and provide a new feedback system. Finally, their points
of view and behaviours determine their company's image, through culture, identity, perception
of the market and / or needs and / or requests of customers.
Finally, in phase 6 possibility of verifying the results, while the organizational strategy and
is reflected in and of the company's image. It is clear that convergence of channels can
cause a high speed process.

Conclusions
Organizational change and its effective and efficient management are prerequisites to the
viability and organizational sustainability.
Here is the context in which at organizational level, management is faced with new challenges
where their resolution shapes the very future of each company.
Our study has shown that entrepreneurs / managers of Romanian SMEs IT & C area has not
adopted a consistent approach to change management based on the rationality, developing and
implementation of strategies to achieve organizational change.
At the same time, we found that organizational change processes are initiated, usually ad hoc,
depending on current issues, without being based on coherent plans of action, which endanger
the sustainability of IT & C SMEs.
The study results also revealed that although the mode of perception on the rationality and
implementation of change management in SMEs from the IT & C area influence, direct and
positive performance of the organization and, hence, organizational sustainability, calling
strategies for implementing change management is in most cases, punctual and retroactive,
not proactive and systemic.
Our science approach has been completed by proposing a model of organizational change in
