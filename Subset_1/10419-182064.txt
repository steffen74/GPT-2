
INTRODUCTION

“I think the next (21st) century will be the century
of complexity” [66]. This statement by Stephen W.
Hawking [66] from the year 2000 describes the current
situation in science and practice. Maguire, Allen
and McKelvey [92] describe that “complexity is one
of the fastest growing topics” in scientific research.
In practice, the same situation can be observed.
Complexity in manufacturing companies and especially
in product development has continuously increased
in many industries within the last years [44, 83, 89,
149, 132]. The reasons are social, market-specific,
technological and economical changes, such as more
and more demanding customers, market’s globalization,
dynamic market environment, technology innovation
and uncertainty. Manufacturing companies have to
face these trends and cannot escape [102, 103, 112,
144]. Increasing global competition and customer´s
individual needs force companies to offer a diversified
product portfolio in the market, by developing different
product variants [3, 32, 45, 65, 35]. A diversified
product portfolio with many different product variants
causes an increase in complexity [26], especially
in products and in processes [8]. Other reasons for
increasing complexity in product development are the
increasing number of product launches in the market,
development and innovation is an important key factor
for business success. For company´s strategy, product
development became a central importance [36, 39, 63].
Increasing complexity is one of the biggest tasks that
manufacturing companies have to face and to handle
today [44]. According to Warnecke and Puhl [147],
company´s complexity can only be managed if it is
identified. Thus, complexity understanding becomes
more and more important in manufacturing companies
[69].
According to Warnecke [146], complexity can be
seen as a phenomenon and evolutionary process, which
is challenging especially for science and engineering.
Complexity is intensified through innovations in
products and processes [146]. In scientific research,
there is no general understanding as well as explicit,
universal and widely accepted definition of the term
complexity [26, 44, 118]. Complexity is “in the eye
of the beholder” [100] and depends on individual´s
experience and knowledge [41]. The origin of the term
complexity comes from the Latin words “complexus”
and “complecti”, which means “extensive, interrelated,
confusing, entwined or twisted together” [44, 54, 60,
113]. The term “complexity” is therefore often used
synonymously with the term “complicated” [44, 54],
but the terms have specific characteristics and different
meanings.
Within a company, product development is one of
the most complex tasks and uncertain processes [12,
39] and has the biggest influence on a company’s
complexity [83]. For a new global economy’s success,
product development is the core process according to
Ragatz et al. [116]. Product development´s objective is
“to translate an idea into a tangible physical asset”
[39]. The time for product development of industrial
goods has strongly reduced during the last years
due to increasing globalization, customer’s behavior
change and hardly predictable market fluctuations
[83]. Product development process is often the longest
part of bringing a product to market [57] and is
confronted with several factors such as demand variety,
uncertain objectives, dynamics, high time pressure
and restricted resources [151]. Generally, complexity
in product development comes from a variety of
internal and external sources [40], called complexity
drivers. Complexity drivers play a significant role for
complexity management. They describe the complexity
in a system and help to evaluate and handle it [142].
For managing a system’s complexity, an optimum fit
between internal and external complexity is needed
[130, 141]. The management of complexity is a strategic
issue for companies to be competitive [102]. For an
effective and target oriented complexity management,
information is needed [39].
Based on scientific research, information can be
gathered by conducting literature research or empirical
studies. To verify existing knowledge or theories and

to identify communalities and differences, the results
from literature and the real world are compared.
In literature, several empirical studies regarding
complexity management in various fields of industries
and regions/countries already exist. They are focused
on different fields in the company and along the value
chain and were conducted in the time period between
1999 and 2015 (see chapter 2.3). There are also
empirical studies regarding complexity management
in the field product development and have been done by
Li et al. [88], Kim and Wilemon [78], Newman [106],
Chronéer and Bergquist [34], Kim and Wilemon [79]
and Grussenmeyer and Blecker [62]. The data collection
was conducted in China, United States of America,
Sweden, Italy and Germany and in 14 different fields
of industries (e.g. engineering, electrical, medical
industry, chemical & pharmaceutical, clothing, etc.).
Based on these studies, the impact of environmental
complexity and the choice of management control
systems and their effects on product development
and their processes are investigated. Furthermore, the
sources, which cause complexity and the consequences
when complexity arises in new product development and
especially in development projects, are identified and
analyzed to increase transparency and understanding
for an effective complexity management. In addition,
the complexity level in new product development is
analyzed and the question of how complexity can be
reduced through standardization and modularization
is discussed.
For an effective complexity management, it is
necessary to identify the complexity sources, called
complexity drivers, and their effects first [142]. None
of the previous empirical studies regarding complexity
management in product development is concerned with
the identification and analysis of complexity drivers
and their effects. Furthermore, no comparison between
the empirical findings and literature has been done in
the previous empirical studies.
The purpose of this paper is to close this research
gap by an empirical research regarding complexity
drivers and their effects to verify scientific findings
and to compare the literature and the empirical results
to identify similarities and differences. The perception
between science and practice and their discrepancy is
described and processed. A further contribution of this
empirical study is to develop additional knowledge
(scientific based – practice driven) according to
complexity in product development for science and
practice within a systematical and target-oriented
data collection and the succeeding comparison of the
literature with the empirical results.
From scientific perspective, this empirical research
establishes a connection between scientific research
and the real world by answering the research questions
(see chapter 2) within the systematical gained empirical
data. It closes a currently existing gap in scientific
literature by comparing the literature and empirical
between the theoretical and the empirical results, the
theoretical findings can also be confirmed, advanced
or progressed within this empirical research. This
study presents a theoretical overview about complexity
drivers in product development and the existing
empirical researches and gives the researcher an
overview about what is already known in practice
about these issues and practice´s tendencies (empirical
findings). Furthermore, the researcher gains some detail
information about the research and data collection
methodology, the objectives and the sample description
to increase transparency. This enables the researcher to
reproduce the findings. Based on this study, researchers
can build new ideas, theories and hypotheses for their
own research. Within this research, the gaps for future
research are pointed out.
From practical perspective, this empirical study
gives the practitioner an overview about complexity
perception in product development by other practitioners.
Furthermore, the practitioner receives a differentiated
overview of complexity in product development,
which is perceived in different fields of industries.
This study also answers the following manager´s
questions “What complexity sources (drivers) have a
high influence on product development´s complexity
and thus are relevant for the company?” and “What
effects do high complexity within the company have
on product development?”, by providing an overview
about the main and relevant complexity drivers, which
were assigned by the respondents with a strong or very
strong influence on product development´s complexity.
Beyond, the practitioner gets an overview about the
main topics and properties in product development with
high complexity, which have a strong or very strong
influence on product development’s performance as
said so by the respondents. This overview can increase
transparency for the practitioner.
As already mentioned, different complexity drivers,
focused on product development, are described in
literature by several authors. To compare literature´s
findings with the practice, this empirical research was
conducted. This research paper is structured as follows:
In section 2, the paper gives a literature overview about
the complexity drivers in product development and
their effects on company´s complexity. Furthermore,
an overview of existing empirical research in the field
of complexity management is described. The research
methodology and objectives, questionnaires´ design as
well as the data collection methodology and sample
description are presented in section 3. The empirical
findings are described in section 4. Furthermore,
the results are compared with literature to identify
commonalities and differences. Section 5 concludes
the paper with implications for future research and
presents this research´s limitations.

LITERATURE REVIEW

2.1

Research methodology and boundary
definition
This paper´s purpose is to compare literature´s
findings regarding specific complexity drivers and
their effects on company´s complexity, especially in
product development, with the real world to increase
transparency and knowledge for science and practice by
identifying similarities and differences. Furthermore,
an overview about existing empirical studies in the field
complexity management is presented. The empirical
study was conducted in the manufacturing industry of
Germany.
Before starting an empirical research, the existing
literature regarding the complexity drivers and their
effects as well as the previous empirical studies must
be reviewed. The following chapter presents a literature
review in these 3 issues. For this literature review,
we used the methodology of Fink [48] and defined 2
research questions:
RQ1: What complexity drivers currently occur in the
field product development in manufacturing
companies in scientific literature? What effects
do complexity drivers generally have on
company´s complexity?
RQ2: What empirical studies in the field complexity
management currently exist in scientific
literature? What objectives do they have and
what research methodologies are applied?
What empirical studies concern with specific
complexity drivers and their effects?
Next, we defined the search terms and databases by
following the methodology of Vogel and Lasch [142]
and Vogel [143]. The search terms are formulated
based on the research questions. For search terms´
formulation, we used a particular grammar and logic,
and combined the key words with specific Boolean
operators (AND, OR and NEAR) analogously. The
finalized search terms are created through an iterative
process in order to identify all important literature
sources. To extend the amount of relevant literature,
the literature search was performed in English- and
German-language literature and 8 different databases,
which are specialized in science and economics:
EBSCOhost, Emerald, GENIOS/WISO, Google
Scholar, IEEE Xplore, JSTOR, ScienceDirect and
SpringerLink. Most of the databases are connected with
other databases. For example, EBSCOhost and Google
Scholar are connected with the databases Emerald,
IEEE Xplore, ScienceDirect and SpringerLink. Since
we want to compare our empirical findings with the
existing literature in the same time period, the time
period of our literature research was restricted between
1900/01/01 and 2015/12/31, because our empirical
study was performed in the years 2015 and 2016.
the field complexity management: 26,699 literature
sources) and comprises research papers from journals,
conference proceedings, books, essays and PhD theses.
Several literature sources were found more than once.
Answering the first and second research question,
the existing literature was analyzed, evaluated and
synthesized based on the research questions by using
qualitative data analysis techniques to identify the
relevant literature sources. Literature research always
accumulates many publications, but only a few are
relevant for scientific research [48]. Synthesizing the
results of the literature research is therefore necessary
to identify the relevant literature sources. For the
qualitative data analysis, we used the methodology of
Vogel and Lasch [142], which is described in detail in
their publication. In the following subchapters 2.2 and
2.3, the results of our literature research are described.
2.2

Complexity drivers in product development
and their effects on company´s complexity
The result of our literature research is a systematic,
explicit and reproducible literature review about
complexity drivers in manufacturing companies and
along the value chain, published by Vogel and Lasch.
In their literature review, Vogel and Lasch identified
different definitions about complexity drivers and
generated a more general definition of complexity
drivers [142]. Further, they described a variety
of methods for complexity driver´s identification,
operationalization, and visualization and presented
several different complexity drivers, which occur in
manufacturing companies and along the value chain,
including the field product development. Based on
literature, complexity drivers have a direct influence
on the company and the total value chain [130]. The
knowledge about complexity drivers is necessary
to develop an effective complexity strategy [135].
As already mentioned, product development has the
biggest influence on a company’s complexity [83].
The first step in developing and implementing a
target oriented complexity management in a company
and finally in product development is to identify the
corresponding complexity drivers [49, 53, 112]. Keuper
[76] followed this argumentation and described that
the handling of company´s complexity depends on
the complexity drivers. In their literature review,
Vogel and Lasch [142] defined complexity drivers as
“factors, which influence a system´s complexity and
company´s target achievement. They are responsible
for increasing system´s complexity level and help to
define the characteristics or the phenomenon of a
system´s complexity. Complexity drivers are influenced
by one another that is by internal or external drivers,
and cannot be reduced completely to another one”.
According to their origin, complexity drivers can
be separated in internal and external drivers [13, 74,
154]. Furthermore, internal complexity drivers can be

differentiated in correlated and autonomous complexity
drivers [15]. Correlated complexity drivers have a direct
correlation to external complexity and are influenced by
it. Autonomous complexity drivers are not influenced
by external factors and the company itself determines
them. Internal and external complexity drivers are
connected directly and induce system´s complexity [9,
38, 56, 58, 59]. They cannot be separated selectively
and they cannot be operationalized [18, 56, 123, 129].
In the literature review from Vogel and Lasch [142],
17 publications regarding complexity drivers in product
development were found between 1998 and 2015. No
publications are found before 1998. Sixty-five percent
of the publications were published between 2010 and
2015. This trend shows an increased interest throughout
the last years and it can be derived that complexity
drivers in product development become more and more
important in scientific research.
Furthermore, 107 different complexity drivers in
product development were found in the literature
review from Vogel and Lasch [142]. The identified
complexity drivers were clustered in different
main complexity driver categories depending on
their origin, characteristics and influence on other
drivers. The classification system consists of 3 main
groups (external complexity, internal complexity
and general complexity), 4 subcategories (society
complexity, market complexity, internal correlated
complexity and internal autonomous complexity) and
22 main complexity driver categories (society, demand,
competitive, supply, technological external, target,
customer, product & product portfolio, technological
internal, product development, supply process, service,
remanufacturing, organizational, process, production,
planning, control & information, resource, logistics,
sales & distribution, general complexity). As a result
of complexity drivers´ clustering, 28 external (26%), 30
internal correlated (28%) and 49 internal autonomous
complexity drivers (46%) were found and identified in
literature. Most of the identified complexity drivers
were assigned to the main group internal complexity.
Thus, this group is mostly influenced by complexity
and must be handled first [142].
Table 1 presents the identified complexity drivers
in the field product development and their literature
occurrence. The most referred complexity drivers
are organizational complexity (N: 6), process
complexity (N: 5) and product structure/ design (N:
5). As also seen in Table 1, some authors appointed
more complexity drivers than other authors in the
field product development. The amount of complexity
drivers in a system, especially in product development,
reflects the level of difficulty in managing a system`s
complexity, because complexity drivers have a high
influence on a system´s complexity. The number of
identified complexity drivers in product development
ranges from 2 up to 38 (see Table 1) and depends
on the situation and the eye of the beholder. In the

supply process complexity, service complexity and
remanufacturing complexity, no specific complexity
drivers were appointed by the authors. It seems
that these categories are not so relevant for product
development from literature’s point of view. Based on
these results, in practice, the same or other complexity
drivers can occur from our point of view. For example,
the category remanufacturing complexity could
be relevant for product development´s complexity,
because in product development, product’s structure,
materials and functions are defined and these are
relevant for product´s remanufacturing. Thus, an
empirical research must be performed to identify new
complexity drivers or to confirm the existing drivers.

In the end, the empirical results are compared with the
results from literature to identify communalities and
differences. For designing the questionnaire of our
empirial research, only the literature sources, which
were published before 2015 were considered, because
the empirical research started already in 2014 with the
pretest. After the pretest, the final questionnaire started
at the beginning of the year 2015. The publications from
Bosch-Rekveldt et al. [19] and Oyama, Learmonth
and Chao [109] were not yet published at the time the
questionnaire started and thus their findings were not
implemented in questionnaire’s design.

and its origin within the company [73]. In literature,
the authors describe several effects of high complexity.
Furthermore, effects of high complexity are divided in
different categories, although the differentiation in 2
categories is preferred in literature.
For example, Meyer [101] divides the effects of
high complexity in 2 categories: general effects and
effects on company´s cost level. Keuper [76] specifies
the effects into cost effects and divides them also
in 2 categories: direct costs (e.g. costs for product
development or prototype testing) and time-delayed
costs (e.g. cost for employees or data processing).
Schuh and Schwenk [129], Schuh [130] and Thiebes
and Plankert [139] divide the effects of high complexity
also in the 2 categories direct effects (e.g. costs for
product and product development process or quality
management) and indirect effects (e.g. product
cannibalization or distributions system´s effectiveness).
However, the divisions made by the already mentioned
authors are fairly equal to Keuper´s classification. In
contrast, Gießmann [54] divides the effects of high
complexity into 4 main categories: time (e.g. time for
quality checks or process time), quality (e.g. process
balance or adherence to deadlines), costs (e.g. direct
costs or indirect costs), and flexibility (e.g. design
flexibility or process flexibility). Furthermore, Meyer
[101] divides the effects of high complexity into 11 main
categories: procurement (e.g. inventory or resource
planning), research and development (e.g. development
process of new products or product tests), costs (e.g.
development costs or coordination costs), logistic (e.g.
inventory or amount of required resources), marketing
(e.g. pricing or product reclamation), product (e.g.
product design), production (e.g. amount of required
tools or controlling effort), process (e.g. process
planning and controlling or coordination effort), total
company (e.g. quality or efficiency), management
and controlling (e.g. calculation effort or economy)
and other parts (e.g. delivery time or supplied goods
or resource variety). Wildemann [151], Benett [10],
Schuh and Schwenk [129] and Schuh [130] assign the
complexity effects based on variety to the specific parts
of the value chain and describe therefore 7 categories:
supplier (e.g. outsourcing complexity), research and

development (e.g. effort for product development or
product tests), procurement and logistics (e.g. stocks
or material staging), production (e.g. quality or
preproduction costs), distribution (e.g. marketing costs
or coordination effort), distribution channel (e.g. costs
for product handling or forecast´s accuracy) and aftersales service (e.g. stockpiling of spare parts or training
for staff members).
For effect´s classification, we analyzed the specific
effects from different authors and created intersections
between the mentioned complexity effects. In general,
we found out that most of the mentioned complexity
effects can be aggregated in 4 main categories. Keuper
[76], Schuh and Schwenk [129], Thiebes and Plankert
[139], Gießmann [54], Meyer [101], Wildemann [151],
Benett [10] and Schuh [130] assigned complexity
effects under the categories time, quality and costs.
Gießmann [54] extended the main categories by adding
the category flexibility. In our general framework, we
defined 4 main categories for the complexity effects,
based on literature: time, quality, costs and flexibility.
Based on the already mentioned categories from
different parts of the value chain, which were found
in literature, we defined a more general framework
for identification, analyzing and evaluation of the
complexity effects along the value chain. In general, the
value chain is separated in 7 different fields, according
to Vogel and Lasch [142]: product development,
procurement/purchasing, logistics, production, order
processing/distribution/sale, internal supply chain and
remanufacturing (see Fig. 1).
This framework is the basis for identification,
analysis and evaluation of the complexity effects in
product development within our empirical study,
because the field product development is also a part of
the value chain.
2.3
Overview of existing empirical researches
For a researcher, it is important to review existing
empirical studies in the same or a similar scientific
area before starting an empirical research, because it
allows him to get an overview about their objectives,
research methodologies and findings [91]. Theories and
statements in literature and practice can change over
time, so it is important to determine and to review the
practical side by an empirical research [71].

Figure 1: General framework for identification, analysis and evaluation of the complexity effects
performed analogously to the literature research about
complexity drivers and their effects (see chapter 2.2).
The objective was to identify all existing empirical
researches concerning complexity management
in manufacturing companies and focusing on
complexity drivers and their effects on company´s
complexity during the last years. The literature
research resulted in 72 different empirical studies in
the time period between 1999 and 2015, which are
focused on complexity management. These studies
were analyzed and synthesized regarding their content,
research objectives, focus, field of industry, region/
country, research period and applied data collection
methodology.
The conducted empirical researches analyzed
company’s complexity with different objectives, data
collection methodologies and focuses. Table 2 presents
the results of our literature analysis.
The empirical studies are focused on 8 different
fields: general in manufacturing companies (N: 32;
44%), product development (N: 6; 8%), production
(N: 3; 4%), logistics (N: 5; 7%), order processing /
distribution / sale (N: 4; 6%), internal supply chain (N:
16; 22%), remanufacturing (N: 2; 3%) and other fields
(N: 4; 6%) (see Table 2). Most of the empirical studies
are focused on the fields general in manufacturing
industries and internal supply chain. The most applied
data collection methodologies are questionnaires (N:
37) and expert interviews (N: 41).
During our literature analysis, we identified
13 different empirical studies, which are focused
on complexity drivers, in the fields general in
manufacturing companies (N: 3), production (N:
2), logistics (N: 2), order processing, distribution
and sale (N: 2), internal supply chain (N: 2) and
remanufacturing (N: 2). However, no empirical study
regarding complexity drivers and their effects in
product development exists in literature.
Table 2 shows that previous empirical studies
regarding product development have been done by the
following 6 authors: Li et al. [88], Kim and Wilemon
[78, 79], Newman [106], Chronéer and Bergquist [34]
and Grussenmeyer and Blecker [62]. The empirical
studies were conducted in different countries and fields
of industries between the time period 2005 and 2013.
In these studies, the authors pursued also different
objectives.
In their empirical study, Li et al. [88] analyzed the
impact of environmental complexity on the choice
of management control systems and their effects on
product development and process decisions. The study
was conducted in China in the year 2002 by using
questionnaires and comprises 9 different fields of
industries: Engineering, electrical, metal & materials,
chemical & pharmaceutical, food, clothing & textile,
telecommunication, commercial products and other
fields of industries.

Kim and Wilemon [78, 79] published 2 papers with
results from their empirical researches. In their first
study, they identified and analyzed the conditions,
which cause complexity in new product development
to increase the understanding of an effective
complexity management. Furthermore, they identified
and analyzed methods for complexity handling. The
second study was done with the objective to increase
the understanding of the consequences in new product
development projects when complexity arises and
the competitive advantages for companies, which
manage complexity effectively. The 2 studies were
conducted in the USA, especially in the states of
New York and Connecticut and comprised 5 different
fields of industries: Engineering, electrical, industrial
photographic paper, medical industry, heating and
ventilating as well as air conditioning industry. In their
empirical studies, the methodology expert interviews
was used for data collection. None information
regarding the research period was mentioned in the
publications and no complexity drivers were identified.
Newman [106] analyzed the complexity of a global
new product development process and discussed the
question how complexity can be reduced through
component´s standardization and modularization. The
study was done by using expert interviews. Regarding
research period, field of industries and region, no
information was given.
Chronéer and Bergquist [34] identified and analyzed
the complexity regarding research and development
projects. The study was conducted in Sweden and
comprised 6 different fields of industries: Metal, rubber
& plastics, chemical, papers, mining and food & dairy.
For data collection, they combined the 3 methodologies
expert interviews, case studies and observations.
None information regarding the research period was
mentioned in literature.
Another empirical study in the field of product
development was done by Grussenmeyer and Blecker
[62]. The study was conducted in Germany and Italy
in the year 2011. The objective of their study was the
analysis of project´s complexity level in new product
development and the evaluation of a specific complexity
management in product development. In their research,
Grussenmeyer and Blecker [62] used questionnaires for
data collection. Regarding the fields of industries, none
information was mentioned in literature.
Table 3 summarizes the results of our analysis
according to the previous empirical researches
regarding complexity management in the field product
development. The table shows a list of current existing
empirical studies and gives an overview of their
specific research period, region, field of industries and
applied data collection methodologies. Furthermore,
the existing empirical studies are analyzed and
evaluated in comparison with the objectives of our
empirical study regarding complexity management in
product development. The evaluation is based on the
following 3 criteria: fulfilled (+ +), partial fulfilled (+)

Analyzing the existing empirical studies regarding
complexity in product development (see Table 3) as
well as other fields (e.g. general in manufacturing
companies, production, logistics, etc.), we come to
the conclusion that no empirical research focusing on
complexity management in product development in
manufacturing companies in Germany, including the

identification and analysis of complexity drivers and
their effects exists yet. By presenting a systematic,
explicit and reproducible empirical research regarding
product development in manufacturing companies
in Germany, we want to close the aforementioned

EMPIRICAL RESEARCH

3.1
Research methodology and objectives
In this empirical research, we followed the methodology
of Flynn et al. [50]. Based on social sciences, Flynn et
al. [50] developed a 6 stage systematic approach for
conducting an empirical research (see Fig. 2). This
helps the researcher describing what happens in the real
world [105]. The approach starts with the determination
of the theoretical foundation (stage I) and the research
design, which is applied to the research problem and
the theoretical foundation (stage II). In stage III, the
data collection method is selected. Data collection
is an important part of an empirical research [71].
Several methods are described in literature and can be
combined for better results [50, 71]. The data collection
method, which is mostly used, is the questionnaire. It is
a useful technique for single and multiple case studies
as well as panel studies and focus groups. Next, the
data collection methods and sample description for
research´s implementation are selected in stage IV.
Before preparing the research report for publication
(stage VI), the collected data is processed and analyzed
in stage V [50].
The first step in performing an empirical research
is to define the research questions and objectives.
Empirical research can be used to document the
state-of-the-art in different fields of research [50].
In this paper, we use an empirical research to
document the current state in practice regarding the
complexity drivers and their effects in the field of
product development in the manufacturing industry of
Germany. A further objective is to compare literature
findings with the results from our empirical research to
identify commonalities and differences. Based on our
introduction, the literature review and the identified
research gap, we determined 4 further research
questions, focused on our empiricism (called empirical
research question) to close the research gap:
RQ 3: How is the product development of the
participating companies characterized regarding
product and variant range; length of product life
cycle and product development process; amount
of applied components, materials, technologies
and processes; the height of the own value

adding percentage as well as organization´s
influence on product development´s complexity?
RQ 4: What are the main complexity drivers in product
development and what interdependencies exist
between them? Can the complexity drivers be
aggregated to factors?
RQ 5: What influences have high complexity and
especially the complexity drivers on product
development’s complexity?
RQ 6: What are the significant differences and
commonalities between the literature and
practical (empirical) results?
Regarding the limitations of our research approach,
we decided to limit the scope of our empirical research
by analyzing only the German manufacturing industry,
because the German manufacturing industry and
its product development is one of the most leading
industries in the world compared to other countries and/
or field of industries. Furthermore, by our limitation
we want to ensure that this research is manageable.
In addition, we had only data from the German
manufacturing industry available for our empirical
research. Data from other countries and/or field of
industries was not available at the time our research
was conducted.
3.2

Questionnaire´s design, data collection
methodology, sample description and
statistical analysis
The implementation of an empirical research starts
with the selection of the data collection method and
the sample description [50]. For data collection, a
standardized questionnaire with 15 questions and a
fixed response possibility was applied in this research,
because the questionnaire is the most used data
collection method in scientific research and provides
the best results regarding reliability, validity and
generalization [50].
The data was collected from a stratified random
sample. The sample was taken out of a given population
of 17,862 manufacturing companies, located in
Germany with more than 50 employees. The research
was conducted in 2015 and 2016. At the beginning
of our empirical study in 2015, the population of
17,862 manufacturing companies was determined
based on the Amadeus database. In the Amadeus
companies with more than 50 employees, because the
complexity phenomenon primarily occurs in bigger
companies rather than in smaller.
As already mentioned, we used a standardized
questionnaire for data collection. The questionnaire
was sent in 2 stages by e-mail to 3,086 companies,
exclusive of service and printing companies. According
to Mayer [97], we use a 2 stage empirical research
to increase the amount of responded questionnaires
and thus the research´s quality. To increase answer´s
significance, the companies were asked in the cover
letter to send the questionnaire to an experienced
employee from the product development department.
However, this is no guarantee that the questionnaire
is send to the right person within the company and/
or product development department. In this research,
we assume that the responded questionnaires were
answered by the right persons. All participants were
assured that only aggregated data would be presented.
The stratified random sample size (n = 1,565) is
calculated based on the methodology of Mayer [97] and
Raab, Poost and Eichhorn [115]. The input parameters
are the population (N = 17,862); a safety factor (t =
2); the proportion of the elements within the random
sample, which fulfills the feature characteristic (p =
0.5); and the sampling error (d = 0.05). The population
comprises the amount of documented companies in the
Amadeus database and the safety factor depends on
respondents´ level of significance.
For questionnaire´s design, the questions with
the same focus are clustered in main categories to
increase understanding and transparency [84]. The
questionnaire in this study was structured in 3 main
parts: general information regarding the respondents
(company size, field of industry and respondent´s
position in the company); general information about
product developments characteristics (dimension of
product and variant range; length of product life cycle
and product development process; amount of applied
components, materials, technologies and processes; as
well as the height of the own value adding percentage)
and information about the complexity drivers and their
effects.
The questions were formulated based on the research
questions. To ensure representative results, the
questions must be formulated explicit and easily [84].
In the questionnaire, the scale items were designed
as statements and the interviewees were asked about
their assessment. For measurement, we used nominal
scales (yes / no) and ordinal scales (1 – no influence;
2 – small influence; …; 5 – strong influence; 6 – very
strong influence) to increase reliability, validity and
comparability. Other scale items such as interval or
rational are not used in this research, because these
scales have another focus and are not applicable in this
research.
Before starting the empirical research, a first version
of the questionnaire was pretested to identify and

17

remove systematic gaps and inconsistencies [68]. In
2014, our questionnaire was pretested by 40 experts
from the potential target group. The objective was
to check and refine the wording, understanding,
relevance as well as the measurement instrument.
Furthermore, the questionnaire length and the time
for questionnaire´s responding was checked. Based
on pretest´s results and comments from the experts,
the questionnaire was revised and checked again by a
smaller group of experts.
According to Flynn et al. [50] and Moody [105], a
questionnaire has to be analyzed by using statistical
methods. Several data analysis techniques or statistical
tests for statistical analysis exist in scientific literature
and can be used by a researcher, although there is
no general rule to select a particular approach [91].
Montoya-Weiss and Calantone [104] classified the
data analysis techniques into 4 groups: descriptive
statistics (e.g. means, frequencies and proportions);
tests of differences or similarities (e.g. t-test); measures
of dimensionalities (e.g. factor analysis) and statistical
interpretation of parametes (e.g. correlation analysis).
For answering the empirical research questions, we
analyzed the empirical findings by using several
different data analysis techniques without a limitation.
However, some of the results were not significant.
In summary, we used the data analysis techniques
from the groups descriptive statistics, measures
of dimensionalities and statistical interpretation
of parameters. The group tests of differences or
similarities was not applied in this research, because
the data analysis techniques from these group are
used for testing hypotheses. Since we did not propose
hypotheses or did an experiment in our research, we
did not use these data analysis techniques.

ANALYSIS OF EMPIRICAL RESEARCH
AND FINDINGS

4.1
Sample results and data validation
For data collection, 3,086 manufacturing companies
with more than 50 employees, located in Germany,
were questioned. The questionnaire was sent by e-mail
to them. The Amadeus-Database lists mostly general
email-addresses of companies. Therefore, the inquiry
emails sent to those addresses, included the request to
forward the email to an experienced employee in the
department of product development.
Next, the net sample size was calculated by reducing
the total sample size based on the amount of e-mails that
were undeliverable or rejected by the companies. The
net sample size is needed for response rate’s counting
[54]. In our research, the final sample size consisted
of 2,817 companies. In total, 295 questionnaires were
answered completely and resulted in a response rate
of 10.5 percent, which is an acceptable response rate

Figure 3: Frequency of received questionnaires according to industry and comparison
of results and database’s percentage
11 different fields of industry. According to their
characteristics, the identified industry branches were
clustered in 4 industry clusters: Technical industries,
resource industries, consumer goods industry and
others. The technical industry is the largest industry
cluster and comprises about 60 percent of the
respondents: engineering (30.5%), metal (10.5%),
electrical and optics (9.8%), automotive (8.1%) (see
Fig. 3). Based on the Amadeus database, the technical
industry is traditionally Germany’s major field of
industry with a percentage of 63.5 percent. For result’s
validation, the percentage of the empirical research
was compared with the percentage of the database
to identify differences and communalities. In our
research, the percentage of empirical research and
database are very close in all industry clusters. The
empirical findings are therefore representative and can
be generalized.

Number of employees

In the next step, the number of employees and the
position profile of the respondents were analyzed
(see Fig. 4). With 61.8 percent, the small and middlesized companies formed the biggest group in our
empirical research. Larger companies with more than
250 employees represent 38.2 percent. Based on these
results, it can be concluded that small and middle-sized
companies are highly interested in empirical studies
regarding complexity management and especially in
product development.
The analysis of the respondent’s position profile
shows that 80 percent of the respondents can be
assigned to the category upper management (see Fig.
4). This category comprises the following 3 groups:
Presidents, CEOs and COOs (18.0%); directors and
division managers (26.1%); senior managers and
department managers (35.9%). This result shows that
complexity in product development is an important
issue for company´s management.

Figure 4: Overview about the number of employees and the position profile of the respondents

development characteristic in general of the
participating companies, we requested the following
properties in 10 different questions (Q4 – Q13):
Dimensions of product range and variant range;
length of product life cycle and product development
process; amount of applied components, materials,
technologies and process; height of the own value
adding percentage and organization´s influence on
product development´s complexity. The results are
described in Figure 5. Approximately 75 percent of
the companies are characterized by a medium and
big product (Q4) and variant range (Q5). Based on the
analysis of questions 6 and 7, more than 50 percent of
the developed products have a life cycle length of more
than 72 months (Q6), but approximately 70 percent of
the respondents specified that the length of product
development process is less than 25 months (Q7).
Furthermore, the majority of companies indicate that
their products consist of many different components
(Q8), materials (Q9) as well as technologies (Q10) and
the product development process consists of many
different processes (Q11). Furthermore, the percentage
of the own value adding activity in product development
was analyzed. However, there was no explicit tendency
recognizable (Q12). In literature, organizational
complexity and value added complexity are general
complexity drivers in the company [142]. To analyze
organization’s influence on product development´s
complexity, the respondents were questioned about their
evaluation. More than 75 percent of the respondents
specified that the organization has no negative
influence on product development´s complexity
(Q13). Comparing this result with literature, there is
a discrepancy, especially regarding the complexity
drivers in product development, which are described
in chapter 2.2. In literature, 9 authors described 28
different organizational complexity drivers, which
are responsible for increasing complexity in the
company and especially in product development. It
would be interesting to investigate the reasons for this
discrepancy wihin a further empirical research (e.g.
investigation through expert interviews).
4.2

Complexity drivers and their effects on
company´s complexity
We started our pretest by using the complexity
drivers in product development which are already
mentioned in literature and published before 2015
(N: 72) (see chapter 2.2). Furthermore, we added
additional complexity drivers from other fields along
the value chain to extend the amount of complexity
drivers in total, because product development has an
influence on all parts of the value chain (N: 44). The
complexity drivers originate in the following fields:
General in manufacturing companies [14, 15, 124],
procurement and purchasing [55], logistics [54, 86],
production [44, 128], order processing, distribution
and sales [29] as well as internal supply chain [135]

19

and remanufacturing [65]. In total, the collection of
the complexity drivers used in our pretest comprises
116 different complexity drivers. One of the objectives
of doing the pretest was to ask the experts about the
relevance of the different complexity drivers, because
we wanted to reduce the number of drivers for the
final questionnaire to the truly relevant drivers. As
a result of our pretest, from the expert´s view, only
59 complexity drivers of the total amount of 116 are
relevant and should be used in the final questionnaire
and empirical research. Furthermore, they mentioned
additional important and relevant complexity drivers
that we added to our questionnaire (N: 5). The final
questionnaire comprises 64 complexity drivers in
total. Another surprising result is that the internal
complexity drivers product complexity (general),
product portfolio complexity (general), technological
complexity (general) and development complexity
(general) are not relevant from expert´s view, although
these drivers are fundamentally connected to the
product development process (see Table 4). One reason
is that these drivers are general drivers and are already
known and handled by the experts. Another reason is
that the experts want to have some further information
about specific complexity drivers, which are important
for complexity management in product development.
Thus, these general drivers do not need further analysis.
Table 4 presents an overview about the different
complexity drivers, which are mentioned in literature
in product development and the other fields along the
value chain as well as the results of expert´s evaluation
regarding the relevance of the different drivers.
Answering the forth research question, we used
different statistical methods for analyzing the
questionnaire results. The main complexity drivers
in product development in each driver category
were identified by using the descriptive statistics. In
this research, 64 different complexity drivers were
evaluated by the respondents within an ordinal scale (1no influence; 2-small influence;…; 5-strong influence;
6-very strong influence) according to their influence
on product development´s complexity. The complexity
drivers, which are evaluated by more than 50 percent of
the respondents with a strong or very strong influence
on product development’s complexity are identified as
the main complexity drivers. As already mentioned, 64
complexity drivers were included in the questionnaire,
but only 30 drivers were regarded by the respondents
in different fields of industry as drivers that have a
strong or very strong influence in principle (see Table
4, reference No. 4 in the field explanation). Table 4
presents the identified main complexity drivers in
product development in the different fields of industry,
which are identified in our empirical research. As a
result of our research, some industries are influenced
by more complexity drivers than other industries.
For example, the following fields of industries are
chemical & pharmaceutical industry are influenced by
only 6 drivers.
A further result of our empirical research is that
some complexity drivers are more important than other
drivers, because these drivers occur in most fields of
industries. These include the following complexity
drivers: Market´s economic factors, individuality
of customer demands, number and strength of
competitors, product range/portfolio and amount of
simultaneous projects. The driver variety of customer
requirements influence every field of industry
(see Table 4). Furthermore, product development’s
complexity is influenced to the same extend by
external as well as internal complexity drivers (14
external drivers vs. 16 internal drivers). Comparing
this result with literature (see chapter 2.2), most of
the described complexity drivers in literature belong
to the main category internal complexity drivers (28
external drivers vs. 79 internal drivers). Thus, there
is also a discrepancy between literature and practice.
These results draw to the conclusion that internal
complexity drivers can be handled by the company
itself so they are not considered as problems whereas
external complexity drivers cannot be handled easily
and are therefore regarded more as problems. Thus,
less internal complexity drivers are described by the
respondents in our research as drivers with a high
influence than it would be expected when looking at
the findings in literature.
As also seen in Table 4, the different fields of industries
are influenced by individual main complexity drivers.
The technical industries are characterized by 6 main
complexity drivers: Market´s economic factors, variety
of customer requirements, individuality of customer
demands, number and strength of competitors, product
range/portfolio and amount of simultaneous projects.
The resource industries and the consumer goods
industry are also characterized by variety of customer
requirement and individuality of customer demands.
Furthermore, the resource industries are influenced by
the 3 complexity drivers political framework conditions,
demand´s dynamics as well as technological progress
and the consumer goods industry is characterized by
market´s economic factors, number and strength of
competitors as well as product range/portfolio.
In summary, the external complexity driver categories
general market-related complexity, demand complexity
and competitive complexity and their specific drivers are
most important for complexity management in product
development. In contrast, the complexity drivers
from the categories society complexity, technological
complexity (external and internal), supply complexity,
target complexity, customer complexity, product and
product portfolio complexity, product development
complexity, organizational complexity, production
complexity, process complexity, planning, control and
information complexity as well as logistics complexity,

sales and distribution complexity and the general
complexity drivers have mostly no strong or very
strong influence on product development´s complexity
and do not seem to be so important for complexity
management in product development.
It was surprising that the complexity driver
categories technological complexity (external and
internal), product and product portfolio complexity
as well as product development complexity and their
specific drivers did not have a strong or very strong
influence on product development´s complexity in
total, although product development is characterized
by these categories.
The comparison between literature´s complexity
drivers and the complexity drivers identified in this
empirical research is shown in chapter 4.3.
Next, a correlations analysis was conducted to
test the bivariate relationships and interdependences
between the 64 different complexity drivers. The
results are documented in the appendix (Table 9 Part
A – C). Based on the correlations analysis, 29 strong
(correlation coefficient 0.6 < x ≤ 0.8) and 3 very
strong correlations (correlation coefficient 0.8 < x ≤
1.0) were identified and clustered according to their
origin and the literature’s main complexity driver
categories (see Table 5). Strong correlations between
different complexity drivers occur in the following
categories: Society complexity, demand complexity,
general market-related complexity, technological
complexity (external and internal), supply complexity,
target complexity, customer complexity, product and
product portfolio complexity, product development
complexity, production complexity, process complexity
as well as planning, control and information
complexity and organizational complexity. Beyond,
in the 2 categories process complexity and planning,
control and information complexity, very strong
correlations occur between the different complexity
drivers process degree of cross-linking and amount of
process interfaces, information flow’s dynamics and
variety as well as company’s control level of detail
and requirements of company’s control. Overall, the
correlations analysis provides 2,080 correlations,
however 88.9 percent are weak correlations (correlation
coefficient 0.2 < x ≤ 0.4). Only 6.5 percent are about
medium correlations (correlation coefficient 0.4 < x ≤
0.6) and 1.4 percent strong correlations.
Based on the correlation analysis, a factor analysis
with varimax rotation was applied for complexity
driver’s aggregation. We used the statistic software
SPSS 21 to perform the factor analysis and to list the
eigenvalues associated with each linear component
(factor) before extraction, after extraction and after
rotation (see Table 10 appendix). Before extraction, 64
linear components (factors) are identified within the
data set. In this case, the amount of eigenvectors are the
same as variables and so there will be as many factors
as variables. The eigenvalues are associated with each

by that particular linear component [47]. In our study,
factor 1 explains 25,276 percent of total variance. To
identify the relevant amount of factors, which explains
cumulative more than 50 percent, we extract only
factors with eigenvalues greater than 2. All factors with
eigenvalues of 2 and less are ignored. For optimizing
the factor structure, we used the varimax rotation. As
a result of our factor analysis, we identified 7 factors,
reflecting the complexity drivers. The identified factors
clarify 51 percent of the 64 complexity drivers, thus

Q4:

Dimension of product range

these factors are important for a company´s complexity
management. The first factor describes a company`s
complexity. Product and technology complexity load
onto the second factor. The third and fourth factor
reflects the customer complexity and the market
complexity. Supply complexity loads onto the fifth
factor. The sixth factor describes environmental and
society and the seventh factor describes company`s
target complexity. Table 6 presents an overview about
the identified factors und their factor load’s ranges.

The factor loadings are described in detail in the
appendix (Table 11).
For a target oriented complexity management, the
complexity drivers and their influences have to be
identified. In literature, complexity drivers have a
direct influence on the company and the total value
chain [130] and are responsible for high complexity
in the company. Furthermore, they have an influence
on a company’s performance, especially on product
development. To respond to RQ5, we developed a
framework for identification, analysis and evaluation
of the complexity effects in product development in our
empirical research. The framework is developed based
on the general framework, presented in Fig. 1, and the
different examples, which are described in literature
(see chapter 2.2). In this research, 18 different effects
on product development, which are clustered in the
4 categories time, quality, costs and flexibility, were
evaluated by the respondents with an ordinal scale

25

(1-no effect; 2-small effect;…; 5-strong effect; 6-very
strong effect). The effects, which are evaluated by more
than 50 percent of the respondents with a strong or very
strong impact on product development’s performance,
were identified as the main effects.
Table 7 presents the identified main effects in
product development, the amount of respondents in
the different fields of industry (Nresp) and the amount
of respondents of our survey that evaluated these
effects as strong or very strong in the different fields of
industry (N). As a result of our empirical research and
based on the evaluation results in the different fields
of industries, high complexity has mostly a strong or
very strong effect on the following 4 attributes (see
Table 7): product development time (N: 155; 53%),
adherence to deadlines in product development (N:
128; 43%), product quality (N: 95; 32%) and product
development’s costs in general (N: 123; 42%). High
complexity has a strong effect on the development
time in nearly all industry branches. Furthermore,

high complexity has more effects in technical
industries than in other fields of industry. The most
important attributes in technical industries are product
development time, adherence to deadlines in product
development, product quality, product development’s
direct costs and product development’s costs in
general. In the resource industries, high complexity
has a strong or very strong effect on the attributes
product development time and adherence to deadlines
in product development and thus these attributes are
most important for complexity management. In the
consumer goods industries, only 1 attribute is highly
influenced by complexity and important for complexity
management: product development time.
To answer the fifth research question, a correlation
analysis between the complexity drivers and the
effects was conducted. Based on the results, only weak
correlations were identified. Thus, the results were not
taken into account.

Comparison of literature results with
empirical results
Answering the sixth research question, the empirical
findings about complexity drivers in product
development are compared with the literature findings
to identify differences and commonalities. The
objective is to confirm or to refine existing scientific
knowledge or theories and to identify further research
gaps.
In literature, 108 different complexity drivers in
product development are described in total between 1998
and 2015 (NLit. T) (see Fig. 6 and Table 1). In our research,
only the complexity drivers, published before 2015,
were considered (NLit. 1998-2014), because the empirical
research started already in 2014. For comparing the
literature and empirical results, the complexity drivers,
published in 2015 (NLit. 2015), were also considered. For
the pretest (NPretest T), we used the complexity drivers,
which were already mentioned in literature before 2015
and added additional drivers from other fields along the

64

value chain (NVC). Our pretest resulted in 59 complexity
drivers, which were considered truly relevant by the
pretesters (Nrel.). Furthermore, the experts mentioned
5 additional important and relevant complexity drivers
(NExperts). Thus, our final questionnaire comprised 64
complexity drivers in total (NQuestionnaire T). As a result
of our empirical research, the respondents regarded 30
different complexity drivers as drives that have a strong
or very strong influence in principle (Neval.). Based on
these drivers, different main complexity drivers in the
different fields of industry are identified (see Table 4).
Furthermore, some industries are influenced by more
complexity drivers than other industries.
In summary, 108 different complexity drivers
are described in literature (see Fig. 6). In contrast,
30 complexity drivers with a strong or very strong
influence on product development were mentioned by
experts. These drivers can be separated in 14 external,
9 internal correlated and 7 internal autonomous
drivers. Furthermore, 6 main complexity drivers
were identified. No further complexity drivers were
mentioned in our final empirical research. The different
complexity drivers, which were mentioned by the
experts are described in Table 4 (see chapter 4.2).
In literature, the main complexity drivers are mostly
related to internal complexity (see Table 1). Thus,
the origin of complexity is seen mainly inside the
company itself. In contrast, the identified complexity
drivers from the empirical research are mostly related
to external complexity. In practice, complexity is
regarded as a condition, which is mostly influenced
from outside. The reason may be that companies can
influence and handle internal complexity actively, thus
we come to the conclustion that the companies are
aware of it. Contrary to internal complexity, external
complexity cannot or nearly cannot be influenced by
the company itself and is often unknown. Thus, the
respondents consider the complexity phenomenon

information regarding external complexity drivers to
increase their knowledge.
There were some major differences between our
research and literature regarding specific complexity
drivers as well as driver categories and their influence
on company’s complexity. In literature, organizational
complexity is described as an important driver for
company´s complexity (see Table 1, chapter 2.2). In our
empirical research we found out that the organization
and its complexity does not have a major influence on
company´s complexity (see Fig. 5, chapter 4.1). The
same could be found regarding the complexity driver
categories technological complexity (external and
internal), product and product portfolio complexity
as well as product development complexity and

their specific drivers (see Table 1, chapter 2.2). In
literature, these categories and their specific drivers
are also described as important sources for company´s
complexity. However, in our research, the respondents
classified these categories and their specific drivers
not as important and relevant sources for managing
company’s complexity (see Table 4, chapter 4.2).
From scientific perspective, this comparison allows
a concentration on the most important complexity
drivers (see Table 4). Futhermore, the differences
between literature and practice regarding specific
drivers and driver categories are pointed out. From
practical perspective, this comparison allows not only
an insight about the drivers known in literature but
according to complexity drivers in product development

Further research should analyze the differences
between theory and practice more in detail and
the empirical findings should be used for further
discussions und evaluations in literature. In addition,
the companies should compare and evaluate their
complexity drivers with those described in literature
to question their own identified complexity drivers.

CONCLUSION, OUTLOOK AND
LIMITATIONS

The objective of this empirical research paper is to
develop additional knowledge for science and practice
by identifying and analyzing existing complexity
drivers in science and practice in the field of product
development. Furthermore, the results are compared to
identify communalities and differences and to identify
further research gaps.
In the first step before starting our empirical study,
we reviewed the literature regarding complexity drivers
and their effects (see chapter 2.2). Next, we searched
for previously existing empirical studies regarding
complexity management and gaps in literature (see
chapter 2.3). Our literature search resulted in 72
empirical studies regarding complexity management.
As a result of analyzing all previous empirical studies,

only 6 studies are focused on product development.
Furthermore, we found out that an empirical research
in the field product development in manufacturing
companies in Germany, including the identification and
analysis of complexity drivers and their effects does
not exist yet. In this paper, we want to close this gap.
For our empirical research, we used the methodology
of Flynn et al. [50]. In the third chapter, the research
methodology, the objectives, the sample description
and the methods for statistical analysis are described.
For data collection, a standardized questionnaire
consisting of 15 questions and a fixed response
possibility was sent in 2 stages by e-mail to 3,086
companies in 2015 and 2016. Only companies with
more than 50 employees and located in Germany are
selected. In total, 295 questionnaires were completed.
The response rate resulted in 10.5 percent. Industry´s
range contained 11 different fields of industry. For
this empirical research, we determined 4 research
questions, which were answered as follows.
Answering the first empirical research question
(RQ3), product development´s characteristics of the
participating companies are analyzed regarding
product and variant range; length of product life cycle
and product development process; amount of applied
components, materials, technologies and processes;
the height of the own value adding percentage as well
chapter 4.1.
For answering the second empirical research question
(RQ4), the empirical data regarding complexity drivers
was analyzed and evaluated. Complexity drivers have
an influence on a company’s complexity and are the
basis for a target oriented complexity management.
Based on the statistical analysis, some industries are
influenced by more complexity drivers than other
industries. For example, the automotive industry is
influenced by 12 complexity drivers. In contrast, the
chemical & pharmaceutical industry is influenced
by only 6 drivers. Furthermore, some complexity
drivers are more important than other drivers, because
these drivers occur in most fields of industries. These
include the complexity drivers market´s economic
factors, variety of customer requirements, individuality
of customer demands, number and strength of
competitors, product range/portfolio and amount of
simultaneous projects (see Table 4).
As a further result, complexity in product development
is mostly influenced by external complexity drivers.
We also found out that different fields of industries are
influenced by individual main complexity drivers. For
example, the technical industries are characterized
by the 6 main complexity drivers market´s economic
factors, variety of customer requirements, individuality
of customer demands, number and strength of
competitors, product range/portfolio and amount
of simultaneous projects. In contrast, the resource
industries are influenced by the 5 complexity drivers:
variety of customer requirements, individuality of
customer demands, political framework conditions,
demand´s dynamics as well as technological progress. It
was surprising that the respondents did not evaluate the
complexity driver categories technological complexity
(external and internal), product and product portfolio
complexity as well as product development complexity
and their specific drivers with a strong or very strong
influence on product development´s complexity,
although product development is characterized by
these categories.
To identify the relationships and interdependences
between the different complexity drivers, a correlation
analysis was conducted. As a result of this analysis,
strong correlations between different complexity
drivers occur in the categories society complexity,
demand complexity, general market-related complexity,
technological complexity (external and internal), supply
complexity, target complexity, customer complexity,
product and product portfolio complexity, product
development complexity, production complexity,
process complexity as well as planning, control and
information complexity and organizational complexity.
Beyond, very strong correlations occur between the 2
categories process complexity and planning, control
and information complexity. Based on the correlation
analysis, a factor analysis with varimax rotation was
used for complexity driver’s aggregation. The factor

29

analysis was performed by the statistic software SPSS
21. As a result of the factor analysis, 7 factors were
identified, reflecting the complexity drivers: Company´s
complexity, product and technology complexity,
customer´s complexity, market complexity, supply
complexity, environmental and society complexity as
well as target complexity.
Next, complexity driver’s influences on product
development´s complexity in the 4 categories time,
quality, costs and flexibility were analyzed (see Table
7) to answer the third empirical research question
(RQ5). As a result of our empirical research, high
complexity has mostly a strong or very strong effect on
the 4 attributes product development time, adherence
to deadlines in product development, product quality
and product development’s costs in general. Also, high
complexity has a strong effect on the development
time in nearly all industry branches. Furthermore,
high complexity has a higher effect in technical
industries than in others. In the technical industries
(e.g. automotive or engineering), the most important
attributes are product development time, adherence
to deadlines in product development, product quality,
product development’s direct costs and product
development’s costs in general. In the resource
industries (e.g. petroleum & plastics or glas, ceramic, pit
& quarry), high complexity has a strong or very strong
effect on the attributes product development time and
adherence to deadlines in product development and
is thus most important for complexity management.
In the consumer goods industries (e.g. food, forage &
tobacoo or clothing & textile), only 1 attribute is highly
influenced by complexity and important for complexity
management: product development time.
Answering the last empirical research question
(RQ6), the empirical findings about the complexity
drivers are compared with the literature findings to
identify the significant differences and commonalities
(see chapter 4.3). In literature, 108 different complexity
drivers are described in total without prioritization by
the authors. In contrast, in our empirical study only
30 complexity drivers with a strong or very strong
influence on product development are mentioned and
prioritized by experts.
Summarizing the results of our empirical research,
we developed some additional knowledge regarding
complexity management as well as its drivers and
effects in product development for science and practice.
From scientific perspective, we connected
scientific research with the real world by conducting
a transparent, systematic, explicit and reproducible
empirical research. Further, we compared the empirical
results with the literature to identify communalities
and differences and to close a currently existing gap
in scientific literature, since no empirical research
regarding complexity drivers and their effects in
product development exists yet. In our empirical
research we found out that 30 complexity drivers with a
effects are described without priorization. Further, the
experts stated that complexity in product development
is mostly influenced by external complexity drivers.
In literature, the complexity in product development
is mostly influenced by internal drivers. This draws to
the conclusion that internal drivers are not considered
as problems, because these drivers can be handled
by the company itself, whereas external complexity
drivers cannot be influenced by the company itself
and are therefore regarded more as problems. Thus,
the practitioners need more and specific information
about these drivers. Regarding organization`s influence
on product development´s complexity, the authors in
literature came to the conclusion that organization has
a direct influence. In our research, the respondents
specified that the organization has no negative influence
on product development´s complexity. Based on these
results, the researcher receive an overview about
what is already known in practice and can confirm
theoretical findings or can develop new ideas, theories
or hypotheseses.
From practical perspective, the practioners receive
an overview about complexity perception in product
development by other practitioners and from other fields
of industries. In our research we found out that product
development´s characteristics in the different fields of
the German manufacturing industry are characterized
by a medium and big product and variant range with
a product life cycle length of more than 72 months.
In contrast, the length of product development process
is less than 25 months. The products predominantly
consist of many different components, materials and
technologies and the product development process
consists of many different processes. Relating to
company´s own value adding percentage in product
development, there was no explicit recognizable
tendency.
Regarding the complexity drivers in product
development we found out that some industries are
influenced by more complexity drivers than other
industries. For example, the industries automotive,
petroleum & plastics and food, forage & tobacco
are influenced by 12 different complexity drivers.
In contrast, the electrical & optics industry or the
chemical & pharmaceutical industry are influenced by
only 6 drivers. Furthermore, the following drivers are
identified as important drivers for product development´s
complexity in most fields of industries: market´s
economic factors, variety of customer requirements,
individuality of customer demands, number and
strength of competitors, product range/portfolio and
amount of simultaneous projects. Seperating the
results according to the different fields of industries
it can be seen that the different industry clusters
are characterized by a specific amount of important
complexity drivers: Technical industries (N: 6),
resource industry (N: 5) and consumer goods industry

(N: 5). Based on a factor analysis, the complexity
drivers were aggregated to 7 factors, which reflect the
complexity drivers: Company´s complexity, product
and technology complexity, customer´s complexity,
market complexity, supply complexity, environmental
and society complexity as well as target complexity.
This aggregation helps the practitioner to focus their
activities regarding complexity management in product
development on this specific complexity sources within
the company. Another purpose of this research was
to analyze the effects of high complexity on product
development, to give the practice a specific indication.
In our research we identified 4 different effects in the
categories time, quality and costs and over all fields
of industries: product development time, adherence
to deadlines in product development, product quality
and product development´s costs in general. Within
the different field of industries, the results can deviate.
This overview increases transparency and helps the
practioner to answer the questions “What complexity
drivers have a high influence on product development´s
complexity and are thus relevant for the company?” and
“What effects do high complexity within the company
have on product development?”.
As already mentioned, further research is needed
to analyze and explain the differences between
literature and practice. Based on our empirical
findings, further discussions und evaluations can be
performed in literature. Our research was focused
on the manufacturing industry in Germany in 2015
and 2016. Future research may also include other
countries and sectors as well as companies with less
than 50 employees. It would be interesting to compare
the empirical results from our study with the results
from a further study, which is conducted in other
field of industry or country / region. Furthermore,
the development of complexity drivers and their
importance for a company over time would also be
interesting. Therefore, the same empirical research
should be repeated in the future (i.e. 5 to 10 years) to
identify differences and commonalities of complexity
driver’s perception between now and the future.
