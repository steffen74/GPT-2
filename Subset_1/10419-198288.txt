INTRODUCTION

Globalization involves a multitude of complex processes and phenomena (economic, technical,
cultural, educational, and social) that are designed to change society, integrating it into the worldwide
circuit and having positive effects on countries. Major foreign investments have an important role,
especially in the commerce sector, and cultural exchanges and international migration. Globalization has
started because of problems facing the whole world, such as: improving the quality of life, natural
environment degradation and pollution, depletion of natural resources, economic crises, etc. Thus,
globalization can be considered a process with a significant role in creating strategies of a country for
following one: "the development of worldwide countries from the point of view of economic
interdependence through the increase of volume and a variety of transactions of goods and services across
borders. A much freer and faster international capital flow, but also a wider fusion technology" (1997)
and the World Bank defines it as "the freedom and ability of individuals and companies to begin
voluntary economic transactions with residents of other countries."
At the European level regions were created as a form of administrative and territorial organization,
according to NUTS II to establish a competitive and consistent economy, as the integration into the global
economy was assured. So a premise for socio-economic development is created and this would reduce
regional disparities existing in the European countries. The integration of regions into the global economy
is achieved by attracting foreign investors, infrastructure and tourism and transportation development, a
reduction in migration (although the intercultural exchange is an advantage for regional development).
The EU economic globalization may be built using the ESPON 2013 program that is an operational
program under the European Territorial Cooperation Objective of the Cohesion Policy of the European
Union by means of which financial assistance can be accessed from the European Regional Development
Fund during the period 2007-2013. ESPON 2013 program is a program for the stimulation of the local
development, where all the 27 EU member states participate, together with Norway, Switzerland, Iceland
and Liechtenstein. The total budget of the ESPON 2013 for the 31 states is 47.1 million EUR.
The purpose of the ESPON 2013 program is to support the formulation of EU politics concerning
the territorial cohesion and the harmonious development of a territory, by providing comparable
information, statistics, analyzes and scenarios about territorial dynamics and by emphasizing the capital
and development potential of regions and other territories, thereby contributing to the increasing of
competitiveness, the strengthening of territorial cooperation and the sustainable and balanced
development of the European territory.
Thanks to the ESPON program, information and statistics that serve the development and territorial
cohesion of the European space are provided. It is inserted in territorial development that in turn is part
of the regional development. The activities of this program are financed by financial instruments.
Cohesion and economic competitiveness may be achieved using ESPON as it provides scenarios
for the European area. The baseline scenario constituted the support of two secondary scenarios that have
territorial) and the competitiveness of the European space. Development policies of the member states
of the European Union are established according to these scenarios because their main objective is the
European regional integration in the global economy.
Now the EU economy is an impressive worldwide one and is considered a world power in
economic terms. The European Union has a dynamic and well structured economy that facilitates a
positive evolution of the Member States. Although there is a controversy regarding globalization and
nationalism, as some consider them opposite, while others interdependent, in Europe it is observed that
for the moment each one is independent, as globalization is strictly economic and helps to the national
construction or reconstruction.

1.

ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF GLOBALIZATION

We can identify opportunities and risks of globalization in the context of mondialisation in the
European Union, but some advantages should be disadvantages, being susceptible to become
vulnerabilities. The synthesis of these advantages and disadvantages is presented in Figure 1, but an
important role of globalization is the reduction of economic and territorial gaps by creating policies that
serve the development of competitiveness and socio-economic and administrative cohesion by
capitalizing the potential of each state and creating opportunities by avoiding labor migration. The major
disadvantage of globalization consists of free movement as workforce can migrate without restrictions
and create the possibility of increasing the demographic risks because of the depopulation in poor areas
without prospects of development.

So globalization militates especially for economic development that the European Union adopted
in the context of globalization becoming a world force. Although its purpose is to create prosperity, but
at the moment there cannot be considered a certainty for each country, depending on the ability of states
to take advantage of those opportunities because otherwise, the greatest risk of a nation is to remain
outside the positive processes of globalization.

2. THE IMPORTANCE OF GLOBALIZATION FOR RURAL AREAS IN BOTOȘANI
COUNTY

Globalization reinforces economic, political and cultural dependence, which at the level of the
European Union it is obvious; however, it offers many opportunities for less developed areas of the
member states to create a development policy with the risk of losing the local identity.
Botosani County currently must use the opportunities offered by globalization and integration into
the European Union because it has a lot of socio-economic problems that can find potential solutions in
the common development strategies at the European level. Among the significant issues facing rural
people who went to work abroad, road infrastructure and poor technical infrastructure, etc.
Priority that it attaches to the global rural economy due to the existing potential in every area and
is insufficiently exploited involves a contradiction at the level of the study area because by addressing
the key problems there is a risk of losing the local identity, especially since Botoșani is an area with a
well-defined rural life and traditions/customs preserved over the years.
The number of unemployed in rural areas of the Botoșani County was continuously increasing in
recent years, and in 2009 (Figure 2) we can see that they are dispersed throughout the region, and they
tend to concentrate in the central-northern and southern areas, but this can be reduced by increasing the
number of jobs, economic development and attracting investment to create a booming economy.
Figure 2 - Geographical distribution of the number of unemployed people in Botoșani;

The number of unemployed people indicates the municipalities which have a high qualified
population, but they do not work and the areas are highlighted with a small number of unemployed
because there are many working abroad. The municipalities with a high number of unemployed are
county (Dobârceni, Dângeni, Ungureni Gorbănesti) has an insignificant number of unemployed because
they have migrated abroad to provide a higher standard of living for themselves and their families. The
cities do not face problems related to the number of unemployed thanks to their success in attracting
investment and creating new jobs.
Another major issue in rural area that can be resolved by development strategies of economic
sectors is the high number of individuals who are receiving social assistance; first this problem underlines
the precarious socio-economic situation of communities and the need to implement an investment policy.
People receiving social assistance can represent a criterion for determining the level of development of
municipalities, but there is a shortage of people as the eligibility criteria for social assistance are
subjective. We can observe a higher number of families receiving social assistance in eastern, northern
and south-western regions of Botoșani.
Figure 3 - Geographical distribution of families receiving social assistance in Botoșani

globalization in rural areas in terms of economic development and higher living standards. In the study
area, due to the integration of Romania into the European Union, the development of the global economy
is supported by European programs and the possibility of accessing funds for applicable development
strategies.
The development of agriculture and industry are the main priorities at the county level, so the
official documents, the Landscape Plan and socio-economic development Strategy indicate the need to
implement development policies. The major objectives of the county’s agricultural policies are: reducing
the fragmentation of agricultural holdings and attracting investors into agriculture for introducing highlevel farming techniques and obtaining the basic raw materials for light industry (food, textiles and
leather, garments and hosiery). Plant growth, being an important sector of agriculture, can ensure its
development by identifying the problems encountered and setting the priorities. However, subsistence
agriculture is a certain fact due to the aging of the rural population and lack of interest for the
mechanization of agriculture, which are the causes for the increase of the unexploited agricultural land.
The industrial sector is a priority for socio-economic development of the county because natural
resources need still to be harnessed (sand, limestone, clay, etc.). The priorities for the recovery of the
neglected industrial activities are: glass industry (Dorohoi), sugar industry (Bucecea, Trușești) by
establishing links with neighboring areas, and also by creating a common market.
Among the benefits of rural areas offered by globalization (and Botoșani requires the
implementation of policies related to its opportunities) there are also the disadvantages resulting from
this space. Freedom of movement has increased the number of emigrants searching for work abroad, and
socio-economic development will lead to loss of the local identity due to the access to modernization and
disappearance of customs and traditions. The risks are deducted from opportunities of Botoșani because
it is a region with many gaps in rural areas and every opportunity for rural development and the reduction
of the socio-economic impact determine the risk of a specific adverse effect of worldwide globalization.

Globalization is a complex and multidimensional process, but also dynamic and sustainable
process. It involves global strategies for the whole of humanity in Europe through the EU programs
because the goal of globalization is to create a uniform framework without major discrepancies from
socio-economic, political, cultural perspectives.
The integration in the globalization process is easier due to large international companies that have
successfully settled here (banks, commercial companies, industries, insurance companies) and attraction
of investment for various economic activities. The area of study requires clear evidence of untapped
potential and opportunities that prospective investors have thanks to the economic development of the
county.
The opportunities and risks of globalization in Botoșani are interdependent because each advantage
is a risk as economic diversification and higher living standards cause the loss of the local identity and
uniqueness of places and freedom of movement is also considered a depopulation risk of the county
because of the possibility of integration into the labor market in a developed country.
Rural development of Botoșani ensures cohesion and territorial, social and economic
competitiveness, integration in the global context of globalization by identifying opportunities and risks
and developing strategies to improve and reduce the possible risks of the global economy.

Among the benefits of rural areas offered by globalization (and Botoșani requires the
implementation of policies related to its opportunities) there are also the disadvantages resulting from
this space. Freedom of movement has increased the number of emigrants searching for work abroad, and
socio-economic development will lead to loss of the local identity due to the access to modernization and
disappearance of customs and traditions. The risks are deducted from opportunities of Botoșani because
it is a region with many gaps in rural areas and every opportunity for rural development and the reduction
of the socio-economic impact determine the risk of a specific adverse effect of worldwide globalization.

Globalization is a complex and multidimensional process, but also dynamic and sustainable
process. It involves global strategies for the whole of humanity in Europe through the EU programs
because the goal of globalization is to create a uniform framework without major discrepancies from
socio-economic, political, cultural perspectives.
The integration in the globalization process is easier due to large international companies that have
successfully settled here (banks, commercial companies, industries, insurance companies) and attraction
of investment for various economic activities. The area of study requires clear evidence of untapped
potential and opportunities that prospective investors have thanks to the economic development of the
county.
The opportunities and risks of globalization in Botoșani are interdependent because each advantage
is a risk as economic diversification and higher living standards cause the loss of the local identity and
uniqueness of places and freedom of movement is also considered a depopulation risk of the county
because of the possibility of integration into the labor market in a developed country.
Rural development of Botoșani ensures cohesion and territorial, social and economic
competitiveness, integration in the global context of globalization by identifying opportunities and risks
and developing strategies to improve and reduce the possible risks of the global economy.

INTRODUCTION

Globalization involves a multitude of complex processes and phenomena (economic, technical,
cultural, educational, and social) that are designed to change society, integrating it into the worldwide
circuit and having positive effects on countries. Major foreign investments have an important role,
especially in the commerce sector, and cultural exchanges and international migration. Globalization has
started because of problems facing the whole world, such as: improving the quality of life, natural
environment degradation and pollution, depletion of natural resources, economic crises, etc. Thus,
globalization can be considered a process with a significant role in creating strategies of a country for
following one: "the development of worldwide countries from the point of view of economic
interdependence through the increase of volume and a variety of transactions of goods and services across
borders. A much freer and faster international capital flow, but also a wider fusion technology" (1997)
and the World Bank defines it as "the freedom and ability of individuals and companies to begin
voluntary economic transactions with residents of other countries."
At the European level regions were created as a form of administrative and territorial organization,
according to NUTS II to establish a competitive and consistent economy, as the integration into the global
economy was assured. So a premise for socio-economic development is created and this would reduce
regional disparities existing in the European countries. The integration of regions into the global economy
is achieved by attracting foreign investors, infrastructure and tourism and transportation development, a
reduction in migration (although the intercultural exchange is an advantage for regional development).
The EU economic globalization may be built using the ESPON 2013 program that is an operational
program under the European Territorial Cooperation Objective of the Cohesion Policy of the European
Union by means of which financial assistance can be accessed from the European Regional Development
Fund during the period 2007-2013. ESPON 2013 program is a program for the stimulation of the local
development, where all the 27 EU member states participate, together with Norway, Switzerland, Iceland
and Liechtenstein. The total budget of the ESPON 2013 for the 31 states is 47.1 million EUR.
The purpose of the ESPON 2013 program is to support the formulation of EU politics concerning
the territorial cohesion and the harmonious development of a territory, by providing comparable
information, statistics, analyzes and scenarios about territorial dynamics and by emphasizing the capital
and development potential of regions and other territories, thereby contributing to the increasing of
competitiveness, the strengthening of territorial cooperation and the sustainable and balanced
development of the European territory.
Thanks to the ESPON program, information and statistics that serve the development and territorial
cohesion of the European space are provided. It is inserted in territorial development that in turn is part
of the regional development. The activities of this program are financed by financial instruments.
Cohesion and economic competitiveness may be achieved using ESPON as it provides scenarios
for the European area. The baseline scenario constituted the support of two secondary scenarios that have
territorial) and the competitiveness of the European space. Development policies of the member states
of the European Union are established according to these scenarios because their main objective is the
European regional integration in the global economy.
Now the EU economy is an impressive worldwide one and is considered a world power in
economic terms. The European Union has a dynamic and well structured economy that facilitates a
positive evolution of the Member States. Although there is a controversy regarding globalization and
nationalism, as some consider them opposite, while others interdependent, in Europe it is observed that
for the moment each one is independent, as globalization is strictly economic and helps to the national
construction or reconstruction.

1.

ADVANTAGES AND DISADVANTAGES OF GLOBALIZATION

We can identify opportunities and risks of globalization in the context of mondialisation in the
European Union, but some advantages should be disadvantages, being susceptible to become
vulnerabilities. The synthesis of these advantages and disadvantages is presented in Figure 1, but an
important role of globalization is the reduction of economic and territorial gaps by creating policies that
serve the development of competitiveness and socio-economic and administrative cohesion by
capitalizing the potential of each state and creating opportunities by avoiding labor migration. The major
disadvantage of globalization consists of free movement as workforce can migrate without restrictions
and create the possibility of increasing the demographic risks because of the depopulation in poor areas
without prospects of development.

So globalization militates especially for economic development that the European Union adopted
in the context of globalization becoming a world force. Although its purpose is to create prosperity, but
at the moment there cannot be considered a certainty for each country, depending on the ability of states
to take advantage of those opportunities because otherwise, the greatest risk of a nation is to remain
outside the positive processes of globalization.

2. THE IMPORTANCE OF GLOBALIZATION FOR RURAL AREAS IN BOTOȘANI
COUNTY

Globalization reinforces economic, political and cultural dependence, which at the level of the
European Union it is obvious; however, it offers many opportunities for less developed areas of the
member states to create a development policy with the risk of losing the local identity.
Botosani County currently must use the opportunities offered by globalization and integration into
the European Union because it has a lot of socio-economic problems that can find potential solutions in
the common development strategies at the European level. Among the significant issues facing rural
people who went to work abroad, road infrastructure and poor technical infrastructure, etc.
Priority that it attaches to the global rural economy due to the existing potential in every area and
is insufficiently exploited involves a contradiction at the level of the study area because by addressing
the key problems there is a risk of losing the local identity, especially since Botoșani is an area with a
well-defined rural life and traditions/customs preserved over the years.
The number of unemployed in rural areas of the Botoșani County was continuously increasing in
recent years, and in 2009 (Figure 2) we can see that they are dispersed throughout the region, and they
tend to concentrate in the central-northern and southern areas, but this can be reduced by increasing the
number of jobs, economic development and attracting investment to create a booming economy.
Figure 2 - Geographical distribution of the number of unemployed people in Botoșani;

The number of unemployed people indicates the municipalities which have a high qualified
population, but they do not work and the areas are highlighted with a small number of unemployed
because there are many working abroad. The municipalities with a high number of unemployed are
county (Dobârceni, Dângeni, Ungureni Gorbănesti) has an insignificant number of unemployed because
they have migrated abroad to provide a higher standard of living for themselves and their families. The
cities do not face problems related to the number of unemployed thanks to their success in attracting
investment and creating new jobs.
Another major issue in rural area that can be resolved by development strategies of economic
sectors is the high number of individuals who are receiving social assistance; first this problem underlines
the precarious socio-economic situation of communities and the need to implement an investment policy.
People receiving social assistance can represent a criterion for determining the level of development of
municipalities, but there is a shortage of people as the eligibility criteria for social assistance are
subjective. We can observe a higher number of families receiving social assistance in eastern, northern
and south-western regions of Botoșani.

globalization in rural areas in terms of economic development and higher living standards. In the study
area, due to the integration of Romania into the European Union, the development of the global economy
is supported by European programs and the possibility of accessing funds for applicable development
strategies.
The development of agriculture and industry are the main priorities at the county level, so the
official documents, the Landscape Plan and socio-economic development Strategy indicate the need to
implement development policies. The major objectives of the county’s agricultural policies are: reducing
the fragmentation of agricultural holdings and attracting investors into agriculture for introducing highlevel farming techniques and obtaining the basic raw materials for light industry (food, textiles and
leather, garments and hosiery). Plant growth, being an important sector of agriculture, can ensure its
development by identifying the problems encountered and setting the priorities. However, subsistence
agriculture is a certain fact due to the aging of the rural population and lack of interest for the
mechanization of agriculture, which are the causes for the increase of the unexploited agricultural land.
The industrial sector is a priority for socio-economic development of the county because natural
resources need still to be harnessed (sand, limestone, clay, etc.). The priorities for the recovery of the
neglected industrial activities are: glass industry (Dorohoi), sugar industry (Bucecea, Trușești) by
establishing links with neighboring areas, and also by creating a common market.
Among the benefits of rural areas offered by globalization (and Botoșani requires the
implementation of policies related to its opportunities) there are also the disadvantages resulting from
this space. Freedom of movement has increased the number of emigrants searching for work abroad, and
socio-economic development will lead to loss of the local identity due to the access to modernization and
disappearance of customs and traditions. The risks are deducted from opportunities of Botoșani because
it is a region with many gaps in rural areas and every opportunity for rural development and the reduction
of the socio-economic impact determine the risk of a specific adverse effect of worldwide globalization.

Globalization is a complex and multidimensional process, but also dynamic and sustainable
process. It involves global strategies for the whole of humanity in Europe through the EU programs
because the goal of globalization is to create a uniform framework without major discrepancies from
socio-economic, political, cultural perspectives.
The integration in the globalization process is easier due to large international companies that have
successfully settled here (banks, commercial companies, industries, insurance companies) and attraction
of investment for various economic activities. The area of study requires clear evidence of untapped
potential and opportunities that prospective investors have thanks to the economic development of the
county.
The opportunities and risks of globalization in Botoșani are interdependent because each advantage
is a risk as economic diversification and higher living standards cause the loss of the local identity and
uniqueness of places and freedom of movement is also considered a depopulation risk of the county
because of the possibility of integration into the labor market in a developed country.
Rural development of Botoșani ensures cohesion and territorial, social and economic
competitiveness, integration in the global context of globalization by identifying opportunities and risks
and developing strategies to improve and reduce the possible risks of the global economy.
