Supply chain contracts are widely used to coordinate disparate but interdependent members of the supply chain.
Contract clauses are legally binding for the supply chain
parties, and within the scope of a supply chain relationship,
parties deﬁne expected actions from each other and measures in case these expectations are not met. In this study,
we analyze two companies operating in a supply chain
using such contracts. The two companies are a consumer
durable goods manufacturer (CDG) and its logistics service
provider (LSP). We ﬁnd the contract parameters that
improve the efﬁciency of coordination and provide the
decision maker, in particular the CDG, with alternative
parameter combinations to achieve the same level of efﬁciency. We empirically test our proposed contract with the
CDG’s data on deliveries distributed by the LSP on the
CDG’s retail network.
In its broadest deﬁnition, coordination is managing
dependencies between activities [1]. Supply chain coordination, on the other hand, is the parties’ optimal arrangement of factors related to the supply chain to minimize
total supply chain costs or to maximize total supply chain
proﬁts, considering the parties’ own objectives [2]. In line
with the established literature on supply chain coordination
with contracts, we deﬁne a coordinating contract as a
contract that Pareto dominates a non-coordinating contract,
where each ﬁrm is no worse off and at least one ﬁrm is
strictly better off with this contract [3]. This means, even if
the contract is not optimizing the supply chain performance

supply chain proﬁt), it would still be considered coordinating as long as the parties using the contract are better off
with the contract than without the contract.
A coordination mechanism should improve the overall
system performance and distribute the beneﬁts of coordination in a manner that entices both decision makers’
cooperation [4]. Bilateral contracts signed between supply
chain members deﬁne the expectations of each party within
the scope of the supply chain relationship, as well as the
measures to be taken in case one or more of these expectations are not met. The lack of coordination is generally
due to different information levels and/or different incentives of the parties, and it may lead to reductions in supply
chain performance by means of incorrect forecasts, low
capacity utilization, low stock turnover, high holding and
related storage costs, delays in product launch, low-order
fulﬁllment rates, insufﬁcient customer service, or low
customer satisfaction [5].
Our research aims to coordinate production and distribution by analyzing alternative contract parameters for a
newsvendor model-based penalty and reward contract.
This contract is empirically tested and observed to improve
the performance (i.e., cost and proﬁt) of supply chain
members. In this respect, we focus on applicable contracts
between a manufacturer and its logistics service provider
and provide a concise review of the recent advancements in
the ﬁeld in Sect. 2, present our methodology in Sect. 3, test
and discuss the proposed penalty–reward contracts with
empirical data in Sect. 4, and discuss the ﬁndings and
conclude the paper in Sect. 5.

2 Literature review
Logistics play a key role in the distribution of goods from
raw material suppliers to original equipment manufacturers
to end-consumers. Logistics outsourcing is an effective
way to achieve a competitive advantage, improve customer
services, and reduce logistics costs [6]. Firms that choose
to outsource their logistics activities can reduce their ﬁxed
costs and increase their ﬂexibility. For subcontracting
manufacturing or outsourcing logistics, contracts are
widely implemented across various stages of the supply
chain [3]. A large amount of research focuses on contracting as primary source of coordination between supply
chain members [7]. Selviaridis and Norrman [8] explore
key challenges of adopting, analyzing, and managing performance-based contracts for advanced logistics services
from the viewpoint of logistics service providers and
highlight the limited empirical work in this area. They
recognize the challenges associated with contract analysis




as the deﬁnition of performance metrics and highlight the
resource investment as an issue for contract management.
Kaya [9] analyzes supply chain contracts for decentralized supply chain models and identiﬁes which contracts
between two parties are the best to use in different cases.
The contracts modeled are between an original equipment
manufacturer (OEM) and its contract manufacturer for the
production of one of the OEM’s products. Taking into
account the effort exerted by the OEM or its supplier to
affect the demand for the products together with the pricing
decisions, the author considers centralized and decentralized models of the supply chain. Especially for the
decentralized setting, he analyzes and compares several
different contracts with each other and concludes that the
coordinating contract depends on the party exerting the
effort.
Liu and Wang [10] model the logistics service supply
chain considering logistics service integrators and logistics
service providers and investigate the inﬂuence of risk
attitudes of chain members on quality control in the
logistics service supply chain. Rather than optimizing the
contract parameters, these authors analyze the LSP’s
compliance and non-compliance with the contract that
governs the relationship between the LSP and the logistics
service integrator using game theory. They conclude that
risk attitude combinations affect the coordination efﬁciency; in particular, the logistics service integrator prefers
a risk-seeking LSP when it aims to achieve high supply
chain coordination efﬁciency [10].
Within the supply chain contract literature, option contracts are preferred when there is a high uncertainty of
demand. In option contracts, the buyer prepays a certain
amount of money (reservation premium) to the seller so
that the seller commits to reserving a certain level of
capacity for the buyer. In the event that the buyer does not
exercise the option to ship the goods, the reservation premium is lost. If the buyer exercises the option, then it pays
the agreed contractual unit price [11–15]. On the other
hand, revenue-sharing contracts are preferred when the
cost of procurement is high. In revenue-sharing contracts,
the seller offers the buyer a low price at the beginning of
the contract period. The buyer, in response, shares its
revenue with the seller at the end of the period [16–19].
Revenue-sharing contracts coordinate the supply chain by
allocating the supply chain’s proﬁt between the seller and
the buyer [20]. He and Liu [21] model the logistics service
supply chains using a joint option contract and a revenuesharing contract between a logistics service integrator, an
LSP, and a logistics service subcontractor among which the
logistics capacity should be coordinated. The contracts
aimed at stimulating the logistics service subcontractor to
LSP.
On the other hand, in the penalty and reward contracts, the
buyer either charges a penalty to the seller for undelivered
items or gives a reward for on-time shipments. The basic
purpose of such contracts is to motivate the seller to reserve
sufﬁcient capacity for the buyer. Since, whether the seller
reserved sufﬁcient capacity or not will be known only after the
buyer has placed its orders, this type of contract can be analyzed using the well-known newsvendor models [3, 22–25].
The three characteristics that deﬁne these models are:
1.
2.

3.

any resource requirement is governed by random
processes
the decision as to how much of this resource to have is
made before the requirement for the resource is known,
and
all economic results can be represented by either
having too much or too little of the resource. The
newsvendor model minimizes the total overage and
underage costs of the buyer.

Contracts coordinating the manufacturer and its service
provider have not yet drawn much attention in the literature.
Notably, Alp et al. [28] modeled the contracts between a
manufacturer and its LSP within the framework of a bidding
mechanism. However, in our study, the LSP has already
been selected, and therefore, contract parameters, which
would make the LSP fulﬁll the manufacturer’s delivery
orders, have to be determined. Within this scope, the
methodology suggested here for analyzing contracts, and
particularly contracts between a manufacturer and its service
provider, can easily be adjusted for use in other domains.
Summing up, the contracts between supply chain
members can help reduce supply chain costs and achieve
coordination. It is possible to describe the objective functions of different members of the supply chain using
mathematical equations, in particular the buyer’s cost
function and the seller’s proﬁt function. The works in the
previous literature used the total supply chain cost under
central decision maker assumption as a benchmark to
evaluate the coordination efﬁciency of proposed contracts
(e.g. 3, 9). Informed by the works cited, we describe our
method to analyzing contracts to coordinate a manufacturer
and its logistics service provider in the next section.

3 Methodology
Coordinating contracts between supply chain partners can
be analyzed using the distributed decision-making (DDM)
paradigm, which is deﬁned as the analysis and coordination
of interconnected decisions [26]. It is especially useful when
there are multiple decision makers in the system, and these

Page 3 of 14 8

decision makers have different information statuses and
decision-making rights. Self-coordination, two well-known
mechanisms of which are competition and cooperation, is
not always possible in a distributed decision-making setting,
especially when hierarchical relationships exist between the
decision makers [26]. Generally, the priority and the
precedence characteristics of interconnected decisions that
need to be analyzed and coordinated result in a hierarchical
structure. This hierarchy can be power based (depending on
the authority of decision makers) or time based (depending
on precedence of decisions). There are basically three different stages of interdependence: anticipation, instruction,
and reaction. The party at the top level of the hierarchy
(CDG) is either the more powerful party or it has the decision precedence, whereas the party at the base level (LSP) is
rather dependent on the decisions of the top level, which is
the CDG. The CDG anticipates the reaction of the LSP
before making a decision and then informs the LSP of its
decision (instruction, which are the contract parameters).
The LSP responds to this instruction by maximizing its
objective function (reaction, maximizing its LSP’s proﬁt).
The LSP does not have a say on the level of parameters but
has a right to accept or reject the contract and can decide to
increase its capacity dedicated to the CDG if it helps
improve its proﬁts. The DDM system between the CDG and
the LSP affects the performance of each party as well as the
supply chain. The hierarchy of decisions between the CDG
and the LSP is given in Fig. 1.
When the capacity availability of the LSP is an issue,
penalty and reward contracts can be used to coordinate the
parties. We consider the long-term capacity of the logistics
service provider as T. The logistics service provider serves
not only the CDG but also other clients. To include this
aspect of the logistics network, we incorporate t as a random percentage of the LSP’s available capacity with a
lower limit tl and an upper limit tu . When the CDG places
its order, the LSP knows the probability density function
f ðtÞ of t but does not know the realized value of t. For a
continuous function, the probability density function is the
probability that the variate has the value x. Since for continuous distributions the probability at a single point is
zero, this is expressed in terms of an integral between two
b
R
points: P½a X b ¼ f ð xÞdx. This is a way of incorpoa

rating the uncertainty in the supply chain into the relationship between CDG and LSP.
As explained in the literature review, the LSP can be
stimulated to increase its delivery capacity dedicated to the
CDG by i, before it receives orders from other companies
in its supply chain, so its capacity available to the CDG
would be tT þ i. The deliveries of the LSP (x) depend on
CDG’s delivery orders (o) and the LSP’s capacity (tT þ i)


Fig. 1 Hierarchy of decisions between the CDG and the LSP

available to the CDG. Deliveries of the LSP cannot exceed
its available capacity or the order placed by the CDG
(x minðo; tT þ i)). CDG’s cost depends on LSP’s fulﬁllment of the delivery orders. If the LSP fulﬁlls fewer
deliveries than CDG needs, then CDG faces unmet delivery
cost (u); if CDG orders more than required, it incurs a cost
of excess orders (d). CDG also incurs the delivery cost (c)
depending on the actual number of deliveries (x). Hence,
the cost of CDG is CDGcost ¼ u½X À xþ þd½x À X þ þcx.
Here, X is the demand for the CDG’s ﬁnished goods (required deliveries) in the classical newsvendor setting [22].
T expected cost of CDG depending on its delivery orders
(o) is given in Eq. (1) [23].

Determination of the lower bounds and upper bounds of
the integrals in Eq. (1) follows from the cost of CDG
(CDGcost ); CDG incurs unmet delivery cost (u) when the
orders are less than required by the demand for its ﬁnished
products (X); and excess delivery cost (d) when delivery
orders are more than required by the demand for its ﬁnished products; and the cost of deliveries (c) depending on
the realized deliveries. In each case, the CDG’s cost
depends on the LSP’s capacity to meet the orders (t ! oÀi)
T
or required deliveries (t ! XÀi).
T
Since CDG is paying for the service it receives from the
LSP, the proﬁt of the LSP can be written in a similar
fashion: LSPprofit ¼ c minðtT þ i; oÞ À e½tT þ i À oþ Àni,
where c is the unit payment made by CDG to LSP, e is the
unit cost of unutilized capacity, and n is the unit cost of
capacity increase incurred by the LSP. Then the expected
proﬁt of LSP is given in Eq. (3).

The penalty and reward terms can then be incorporated
into the CDG’s expected cost and the LSP’s expected proﬁt
by integrating on the intervals where the LSP would incur a
penalty cost for unmet delivery orders and receive a reward
where the orders are met. There will be an additional
penalty term in CDG’s equation that would reduce the cost
and an additional reward term that would increase the cost
since the reward would be given out to the LSP. The
expected cost of CDG is given in Eq. (5) depending on its
delivery orders (o) as well as the penalty (p) and the reward
(r) terms.

Similarly, the penalty term would reduce the LSP’s
proﬁt and the reward term would increase the LSP’s proﬁt.
As explained earlier, the LSP does not have a right to
decide on the penalty (p) or the reward (r) but can decide
on its capacity increase (i) given the penalty and the
reward. In Eq. (6) we provide the expected proﬁt of the
LSP given the penalty and the reward terms based on the
capacity increase i.

From the supply chain management perspective, it
would be optimal to determine the capacity increase that
incurs the minimum expected cost for the entire supply
chain; hence, we deﬁne the expected cost of the centralized
supply chain as the difference between the total cost of the
CDG and the total proﬁt of the LSP since the supply chain
we analyze for the contract is focused on the transaction
between these two companies. The centralized supply
chain can be interpreted as a single decision maker who
manages both the CDG’s operations and the LSP’s operations [21]. Then this central decision maker would like to
minimize the expected centralized supply chain cost that is
given in Eq. (7).

In the centralized supply chain analysis, there is no need
for delivery orders (o) since the central decision maker will
organize deliveries according to the external demand X.
Accordingly, we deﬁne seven possible scenarios
(Table 1) between the CDG and the LSP, to represent the
current situation (S1), the delivery orders that lead to the
optimum capacity increase under the centralized supply
chain (S2), the delivery orders that minimize the CDG’s
cost (S3), the penalty that leads to the optimum capacity
increase under the centralized supply chain (S4), the
reward that leads to the optimum capacity increase under
the centralized supply chain (S5), the penalty and the
reward that lead to the optimum capacity increase under
the centralized supply chain (S6), and the optimum
capacity increase under the centralized supply chain (S7).
The S1 is the current situation, where the CDG and LSP
act independently, and the S7 is the ideal situation where a
central decision maker optimizes the capacity increase that
would minimize the expected total cost for the entire
supply chain, using the total costs incurred by the CDG and
the LSP. In S2 and S3, the CDG does not use the penalty or
the reward in the contract but tries to stimulate the LSP to
increase its capacity by its delivery orders. S2 is analyzed
to reﬂect the optimal capacity increase under the centralized supply chain, whereas S3 is analyzed to reﬂect the
situation that minimizes the CDG’s cost. S4–S6 are analyzed around the penalty and reward terms, all stimulating
the optimal capacity increase required under the centralized
supply chain, by using only the penalty (S4), only the
reward (S5), and both the penalty and the reward (S6).

given contract is to the centralized supply chain cost. In the
next section, we provide parameters calculated from the
empirical data of the CDG and discuss the performance of
each contract scenario (S2–S6) in comparison with the
current situation (S1) and the ideal situation under centralized supply chain (S7). We also provide a sensitivity
analysis on the contract parameters.

4 Case study
The proposed methodology is followed to analyze logistics
contracts between two companies conducting business in
Turkey, a consumer durable goods manufacturer (CDG)
and its highest volume logistics service provider (LSP).
During face-to-face interviews held with CDG Supply
Chain Director and SAP Project Manager in May–July
2009, they indicated delivery problems with all of their
logistics service providers and primarily with the LSP

carrying the highest volume. Since the LSP delivering the
highest amount of goods from CDG’s factories to CDG’s
retail channel transports, approximately 60 % of the manufacturer’s products by volume, it was decided to start
working on logistics contracts with this company and then
extend the ﬁndings to contracts with other logistics service
providers. Figure 2 gives an idea of the extent of operations
with stars indicating hubs and arrows depicting the cities
that these hubs serve. Manisa in the west of Turkey with
two stars is where the factory of CDG is located.
There are multiple dealers of CDG in every city in
Fig. 2. There is an ordering mechanism where CDG’s
dealers place orders for products but also CDG pushes its
products to the market based on its own marketing forecasts and campaigns. CDG uses historical sales data to
forecast its future sales. However, as a consequence of the
effects of the global economic crisis on Turkey in 2009,
great variations were observed between actual sales and
estimated sales in the ﬁrst three quarters of 2009. Another
cause of these variations was the tax reduction exercised by
the government between March and June 2009 to boost the

economic activities. This reduction resulted in increased
sales until the end of June 2009 when the reduction ceased
to be in effect (Fig. 3a, volumes disguised due to conﬁdentiality) and sales dropped back to the level before the
government’s intervention. In the analysis period (January–
August 2009), CDG’s LSP has completed 65,000 deliveries
(disguised), with an on-time delivery performance presented in Fig. 3b.
Apart from the low on-time delivery performance in
April–May originating from the unexpected increase in
CDG’s demand due to tax reduction introduced by the
government to revitalize the economic activity in the
country, the LSP does not reserve sufﬁcient capacity for
CDG; it is late 30 % of the time, on average, and a capacity
increase in the ﬂeet is required. With the exception of 56 %
on-time delivery performance of the LSP at the end of
April and beginning of May, it is observed that the LSP’s
on-time delivery performance ranges between 65 and
75 %. This interval is the percentage of LSP’s available
capacity (t [ [0.65–0.75], uniform-distributed with the
mathematical expression given in Table 1) in the current
situation. It is clear that a mechanism is needed for the LSP
to increase its available capacity for CDG to decrease the
costs associated with non-delivery or late delivery. Figure 4 provides the volume of late deliveries for 1–6? days.
CDG explains that most of these delays are based on

local conditions (for example, regular closures of main
streets due to local farmers markets).
The LSP’s late deliveries result in CDG’s not being able
to place their products in the market on time and consequently incurring lost sales. For the white goods industry,
the value of lost sales is calculated as 11 % of the sales
value [27]. This rate is used to estimate the CDG’s cost due
to late deliveries. In the analysis phase of the contract,
aggregated data are used; delivery volumes are represented
in terms of vehicles and delivery costs are calculated based
on average values because the data on deliveries, delivery
costs, and sales are not kept at the same detail. To meet the
conﬁdentiality requirements, we had to disguise all of the
actual ﬁgures. Following from [27], we calculate 11 % of
the average sales per vehicle to estimate the cost of unmet
deliveries per vehicle for CDG (u = TRY 6275). Based on
the proportion of transportation cost in gross sales provided
by CDG, we calculate the average transportation cost per
vehicle (c = TRY 1550).
There are also costs associated with CDG’s ordering
more than required due to forecasting errors or marketing
decisions. When CDG sends products more than the actual
demand, these products may be returned by the dealers on
the basis of insufﬁcient space. All returns are transported
back to the factory using the LSP’s courier network since
the returned items would not ﬁll up a truck. Subsequently,
using the courier network is more expensive than using the
freight transportation. Analyzing the returns data (returned
items, item volumes, return costs) and aggregating on the
basis of vehicles, the transportation cost of returned items
per vehicle is calculated to be TRY 1745. Since CDG
initially incurred the transportation cost to send these items
to its dealers, the cost of ordering deliveries more than
required per vehicle (d) is this return cost: TRY 1745 (the
return delivery cost using the courier service). At the time
of data collection, 9.7 % of CDG’s deliveries were
returned by its dealers.
According to the analysis on the transported volumes,
CDG’s monthly delivery requirement is 130 vehicles on

website in August 2009. While T is the LSP’s available
capacity for all its clients, as can be seen in Fig. 3b, the
LSP has on average 70 % of its capacity available to the
CDG (i.e., E½t ¼ 0:7). Taking into consideration other
customers of the LSP, it is estimated that the LSP reserves
91 vehicles to CDG (available capacity in terms of vehicles, T Â E½t ¼ 130 Â :7 ¼ 91) per month, lower than
what CDG requires as is evident from the delivery performance. The LSP needs to increase this capacity to
improve its delivery performance, and the cost of this
capacity increase is calculated based on actual vehicle costs
but disguised to be comparable to CDG’s costs. The cost of
increasing the capacity by one vehicle (g) is calculated to
be TRY 1160. The expert opinion of the Chair of Logistics
Association (LODER) in Turkey is used to estimate the
cost of unused capacity for the LSP. It is suggested that in
the long run, this cost would approximate the opportunity
cost of not using the vehicle for transportation. Hence,
unused capacity cost for the LSP (e) is assumed to be the
same as average transportation cost per vehicle c = TRY
1550. We assume that the CDG and the LSP do not behave
opportunistically and they do not exploit information about
the other party. We also assume that the price paid by CDG
to the LSP is externally determined (i.e., it is not optimized
in the model).
The contract between CDG and the LSP was not a
coordinating one; that is, CDG ordered deliveries as
required, and the LSP would temporarily increase its
capacity (outsource deliveries to other available low-cost
logistics service providers) to satisfy CDG’s delivery
requirements if needed. However, this temporary increase
was not preferable by the CDG since it resulted in poor
delivery quality manifesting as late deliveries, or damages
to the products. In fact, as a favorable solution, the LSP’s
permanent capacity increase decision can be affected by
the type of coordinating contract employed by CDG. It is
possible for CDG to use delivery order levels (o), penalty
(p) or reward (r) schemes, or any combinations of these in
the coordinating contract. The results of these different
coordinating contract parameters are compared to the ideal
case, which is full coordination by minimizing the supply
chain cost under central decision maker assumption.
CDG is the party deciding on the coordinating contract
parameters and affecting the LSP’s decision to build extra
capacity. Consequently, the LSP acts upon instructions
(delivery orders) from the CDG. The LSP’s decision to
build extra capacity directly affects CDG’s ability to fulﬁll
their orders on time, and CDG is confronted with the costs
of not being able to provide the products to the market
when they are demanded. The anticipation function
describes the LSP’s capacity increase decision based on




CDG’s delivery orders and the penalty or reward clause
included in the contract. Table 2 summarizes the parameters used in the contract, all of which are derived from the
CDG’s delivery records, collected from the Manugistics
software used at the time.
Once we validated the model with the problem owner
CDG, we solved it under the seven scenarios as described
in the methodology section so that the CDG could choose
the most appropriate scenario. To evaluate these scenarios,
we calculate an efﬁciency measure taking into account the
coordination under central decision maker assumption and
the uncoordinated case.
Efﬁciency of Scenario j = (Performance under Scenario
j—Performance under the uncoordinated case)/(Performance under central decision maker assumption—Performance under the uncoordinated case) where j [ {1,…,7}.
This calculation results in 100 % efﬁciency for the case
under central decision maker assumption and 0 % efﬁciency for the uncoordinated case. The efﬁciency of
remaining scenarios is in the [0, 100 %] interval.
CDG’s cost, LSP’s proﬁt, and total SC cost are given in
Table 3 together with the respective contract efﬁciencies.
When there is no coordination between the parties, the
CDG’s cost is TRY 217,498 and the LSP’s proﬁt is TRY
,039, with the total supply chain cost of TRY 94,459.
The CDG’s cost is lower in any scenario other than S1 (no
coordination). The CDG should prefer coordinating the
chain either using delivery orders (o), penalty (p), reward
(r), or a combination of these rather than leaving the
transaction conditions as it is. On the other hand, LSP’s
proﬁt is the highest with the reward-only contract (S5) and
the lowest in the current situation of no coordination (S1).
Even with the penalty-only contract (S4), LSP does slightly
better (0.05 %) than the no coordination case (S1); hence,
any of the coordinating contracts (S2–S6) would be
preferable. The efﬁciencies of S4–S6 are the same
(96.1 %) as a consequence of the fact that they coordinate
the members with respect to the optimal capacity increase
that minimizes the expected cost of the centralized the
supply chain.
When the contracts are analyzed in terms of the total
supply chain cost, the supply chain cost decreases by
10 % if it were possible to switch from the uncoordinated
case (S1) to the full coordination under the central decision maker (S7). The CDG’s partial coordination with
penalty and reward contracts (S4–S6) leads to lower
expected centralized supply chain costs in comparison
with coordination with delivery orders (S2–S3) and a
9.6 % reduction in total supply chain cost compared to
the uncoordinated case (S4-S6 vs S1). It should be noted
that the parameters were disguised to comply with the
CDG’s conﬁdentiality request and considering the real

Fig. 5 a Delivery orders (o) and b capacity (i) increase under the scenarios

costs is still desirable to the company because of the scale
of the costs.
The CDG’s delivery orders (o) and LSP’s capacity
increase (i) are given in Fig. 5a, b, respectively; there is no
value for o under S7 since the central decision maker
controlling the two parties would not give delivery orders
from one party to another but arrange the capacity increase
according to the external demand (X).
The capacity increase (i) under the central decision
maker assumption that minimizes the total supply chain
cost is 68 in Fig. 5b. In the uncoordinated case (S1) the
CDG’s delivery order is equal to its delivery demand
(o = X) and is 130 delivery orders per month. The LSP’s

capacity increase corresponding to o ¼ 130 is at its lowest
level (i ¼ 63). When the CDG coordinates with the delivery orders that achieve the optimum capacity increase for
the supply chain (S2 : o ¼ 135), the LSP responds to this
level of delivery order with a capacity increase of 68. In
other words, CDG should place a delivery order of 135 to
force the LSP to increase capacity as much as is required
under the central decision maker assumption (S7). In S3,
which minimizes the CDG’s cost without enforcing
penalties, the optimum level of delivery orders is 134,
which is responded by the LSP with a capacity increase of
67, lower than the optimal capacity increase under S7. For
S4–S6, which achieve the optimum capacity increase

Fig. 6 Performance of CDG, LSP and SC depending on coordinating
contract

(i ¼ 68) with penalty-only (S4), reward-only (S5) and
penalty and reward (S6) contracts, respectively; the applicable penalty is TRY 500 and the applicable reward is TRY
3426. For example, the CDG should impose a penalty of
TRY 500 on the LSP or offer a reward of TRY 3426 to the
LSP for the delivery order o = 134 in order to have the
LSP increase its capacity by the optimum capacity increase
(i = 68).
In Fig. 6, the CDG’s cost, the LSP’s proﬁt and the cost
of the centralized SC are plotted with respect to the seven
scenarios analyzed for the proposed coordination mechanisms. As was indicated earlier, the lowest cost of SC is
obtained under the central decision maker assumption (S7).
Consequently, the highest cost of SC is observed in the
uncoordinated case (S1). CDG’s coordination with delivery
orders that minimizes CDG’s cost (S3) reduces the cost of
SC by 9.53 % in comparison with the uncoordinated case
(S1). However, the minimum cost of SC without the penalty-only, reward-only and penalty and reward contracts is
when CDG uses the delivery order that achieves the optimum capacity increase for coordination (S2) with a 9.58 %
reduction from the uncoordinated case (S1). Similarly,
penalty and reward tools decrease the supply chain cost by
9.62 % in comparison with the uncoordinated case (S1).

Again in Fig. 6, CDG’s costs are lower in all of the
scenarios S2–S6 than S1. The lowest cost of CDG occurs in
coordination with penalty that achieves the optimum
capacity increase (S4). On the other hand, the LSP’s proﬁt
is higher in all of the scenarios S2–S6. Thus, CDG can
achieve a more efﬁcient supply chain using any of the
suggested coordinating contracts.
Figure 7a presents the change in the proﬁt of LSP with
respect to the capacity increase in the uncoordinated case
(S1). When there is no coordination, CDG opens delivery
orders as many as required (o ¼ 130) and in response, the
LSP’s optimum capacity increase becomes 63 vehicles.
Under the central decision maker assumption (S7), the total
cost of SC is minimized with respect to the capacity
increase decision. Optimum capacity increase is 68 and the
cost of SC is TRY 85,007 (Fig. 7b). When CDG affects the
LSP’s capacity increase decision with its delivery orders,
the optimum delivery order level that minimizes CDG’s
cost is 134 vehicles (Fig. 7c). In that case the cost of SC is
TRY 85,456 and the efﬁciency of the contract is 95.2 %.
CDG’s delivery orders are analyzed in two perspectives.
The ﬁrst is the S2: coordinating contract with delivery
order that achieves the optimum capacity increase
(o ¼ 135 for i ¼ 68) and the second is the S3: coordination
with delivery order that minimizes CDG’s cost (o ¼ 133
and i ¼ 67). The level of delivery orders that minimize the
CDG’s cost (S3) improves the cost by 3.42 % in comparison with the uncoordinated case (S1), whereas the level of
delivery orders that provides the optimum capacity
increase for the SC (S2) improves the CDG’s cost by
3.42 % in comparison with S1 and worsens CDG’s cost by
0.16 % in comparison with S3. The LSP’s proﬁt increases
by 1.27 % in S3 (coordination with delivery order that
minimizes CDG’s cost) and 1.58 % in S2 (coordinating
contract with delivery order that achieves the optimum
capacity increase). This level of delivery order (o ¼ 135)
leading to the optimum capacity increase for the cost of SC
decreases the CDG’s cost by 3.26 % and increases the
LSP’s proﬁt by 1.58 %. Consequently, the efﬁciency of
this coordinating contract (S2) becomes 95.7 %. For the

Fig. 8 The relationship between CDG’s delivery order, penalty, and
reward

coordinating contract with penalty and reward that
achieves the optimum capacity increase (S6), penalty
(p) and reward (r) that would lead the LSP to the optimum
capacity increase decision that minimizes the total SC cost
are analyzed together with the delivery orders (o). This
way, CDG can choose between various penalty and reward
combinations with respect to the delivery orders (Fig. 8).
For example, to have the LSP decide to increase its
capacity by 68 vehicles, CDG should give a delivery order
of 132 vehicles and pose a penalty of TRY 1985 or a
delivery order of 133 vehicles with a penalty of TRY 1116
(see Fig. 8). If the CDG chooses to offer a reward instead
of a penalty, then the level of reward that corresponds to
the capacity increase decision of 68 vehicles with a
delivery order of 132 is TRY 9626. Although this level of
reward increases the CDG’s cost, it leads to a 2.57 % lower
cost (a difference of TRY 5592) than the uncoordinated
case (S1). In the coordinating contract with penalty that
achieves the optimum capacity increase (S4: i ¼ 68) with
o ¼ 134, the LSP’s proﬁt is increased by 0.05 % (a difference of TRY 64) in comparison with the uncoordinated
case (S1). Therefore, the LSP would be willing to accept
the penalty-only contract if the o ¼ 134, since the proﬁt is
slightly better (not worse off) than the uncoordinated case.

On the other hand, the LSP would be willing to accept the
reward-only coordinating contract with o ¼ 134 since it
leads to an increase in proﬁt by 1.79 % (a difference of
TRY 2201). If the CDG offers a both penalty and reward
coordinating contract, the LSP would still be willing to
accept this type of contract since its proﬁt will be higher (a
difference of TRY 911, 1.79 % higher) than the uncoordinated case (S1), so none of the ﬁrms would be worse off
with a penalty and reward contract but indeed both of them
would be better off.
We also conduct a sensitivity analysis on the parameters
of the problem in the current situation (S1) and the penalty
and reward contract (S6) to observe how the critical deciÀ
Á
sion variables EðCDGcost Þ, E LSPprofit , and EðSCcost Þ
change depending on the associated unit costs. We
decrease and increase one at a time the associated cost of
unmet deliveries (u), the cost of excess deliveries (d), the
cost of delivery (c), the cost of unused capacity for the LSP
(e), and the cost of increasing capacity for the LSP (n) and
show the impact (positive and negative) on CDG’s cost,
LSP’s proﬁt, and the SC cost (Fig. 9).
The results in Fig. 9 suggest that the expected cost of the
CDG is affected the most by the changes in the LSP’s
available capacity (T) followed by the changes in the
delivery cost (c). On the other hand, the LSP’s expected
proﬁt is the most sensitive to the delivery charge (c), followed by the cost of increasing capacity (n). We also observe
that the total supply chain cost is most sensitive to the cost of
increasing capacity and the LSP’s available capacity.
To sum up, all coordinating contracts are better (has
lower cost) for CDG than no coordination. When the
parameters of the problem between CDG and the LSP are
analyzed, it is detected that the most critical problem
parameter for CDG is the requirement for timely deliveries,
followed by clauses addressing the cost of not fulﬁlling the
delivery requests, and delivery costs. On the other hand,
delivery costs and capacity-increasing costs are the most
critical parameters for the LSP. In terms of total supply

Fig. 9 Sensitivity analysis on the problem parameters for a S1 and b S6

requirements, capacity increase cost, and delivery cost.
One would think that the delivery cost should not be
important for the total supply chain cost, since it is the
transaction between the CDG and its LSP. However, it is
critical in terms of total supply chain costs, since it is an
important determinant for the LSP in terms of the level of
extra capacity that it determines to build.

5 Discussion and conclusions
The analysis of the current status between CDG and the
LSP shows that the transportation contracts coordinating
CDG and the LSP could be analyzed as a penalty–reward
contract. Since the CDG incurs transportation costs, its
objective function is the minimization of related costs. On
the other hand, the revenue of the LSP comes from transportation activities; therefore, its objective function is the
maximization of proﬁts. Total supply chain costs are calculated by taking the difference between CDG’s costs and
the LSP’s proﬁts. Five coordinating contracts (S2–S6) are
analyzed, namely coordinating contract with delivery order
(the optimum order quantity for full coordination in the
supply chain: S2 and the optimum order quantity for CDG:
S3), coordinating contract with only a penalty term (S4),
coordinating contract with only a reward term (S5), and
coordinating contract with both penalty and reward terms
(S6). The performance of all scenarios is compared to the
scenario under the central decision maker assumption (S7).
Results indicate that CDG always does better if it uses any
kind of coordinating contract other than the current situation (S1). However, the LSP’s proﬁt is almost the same
when CDG offers a penalty-only contract (S4). In all other
contracts, the LSP earns a much higher proﬁt. Therefore,
using any of the coordinating contracts is recommended.
This study suggests using a penalty–reward contract to
improve the contracts between a consumer durable goods
company in Turkey and its logistics service provider. It can
solve a limited number of problems such as motivating the
LSP to reserve or install more capacity for the CDG and hence
improving the response rate of the supply chain as well as
increasing service levels. One problem this contract is not able
to address is related to the behavior of LSP’s employees which
was highlighted by the CDG during our analysis of the problem. In the eyes of the consumer, employees of the LSP are
regarded as the employees of CDG since they are bringing the
goods of the CDG. However, irresponsible and reckless
behavior of LSP employees were observed by the end-consumers as well as the dealers from time to time and these were
raised as complaints in the communication channel of the
CDG. This would be a concern very difﬁcult to be addressed in
the contract. One remedy can be to invite the LSP’s employees




to CDG’s headquarters and explain their role in the supply
chain, CDG’s brand image, and perceptions and expectations
of CDG customers from them. In this research we do not test
different logistics strategies but actually model the manufacturer’s anticipative planning to coordinate the supply chain
operations by testing different parameters of penalty–reward
contracts.
Although there are numerous studies on the coordination
of different aspects of the supply chain, studying coordination separated from other issues may not be helpful in
coordinating the whole supply chain. The research on the
coordination of the supply chain aspects remains in the
early stages. As is also indicated by [2], although the need
for coordination is understood, there is a need for studies
with a holistic view on coordination, incorporating
behavioral aspects as well. Similarly, supply contract
models analyzed in this study coordinate the relationship
between certain parties of the supply chain at a certain
time. However, a holistic model which incorporates all
players of the supply chain will provide more realistic
results. Building such a model and modeling each player of
the chain by using several operational research and decision models will require enormous effort and comprehensive study where conﬁdentiality of information may
surface as one of the major problems.
The contribution of this study is that it shows the
manufacturer can decide on the contract parameters by
anticipating the reaction of its logistics service provider. It
is proved in this case study that coordination between a
manufacturer and its logistics service provider can be
achieved using contracts and that better levels of objective
functions can be reached mathematically and empirically.
In summary, the proposed methodology and its application
were used to solve a real supply chain contract problem and
to establish an analytical basis for the manufacturer’s
contracts with its logistics service providers. The proposed
framework can be followed to analyze contracts of the
manufacturer with its raw materials or unﬁnished goods
suppliers. However, some limitations of this approach
should also be recognized. Depending on the parameter
values, market governance could be better than an agreement under a reward-penalty contract. For example, when
both companies are worse off under the penalty–reward
contract, it would be more appropriate to act independently
rather than implementing the contract, which means a
penalty–reward contract may not always be efﬁcient.
Therefore, a sensitivity analysis should be performed on
the parameter values to identify the ranges for which the
companies are better off by using this type of contract.
One of the issues to be addressed in logistics contracts,
which we did not consider in this work, is the transportation damage. The actions to be taken in the event of

communication procedures and responsibilities of the
logistics services provider, can be addressed in the contract
as separate clauses, or can be mentioned in the appendix of
the contract as a protocol or a procedure. It is important to
choose a reliable transporter and an appropriate transport
vehicle to minimize transportation damage. For the party
purchasing logistics services, working with an experienced
LSP may be appropriate, since working with a random or
untested LSP may lead to damaged products, delays, low
quality service, and, accordingly, additional costs and the
loss of business. Although proﬁts may not increase as a
result of coordination [28], the costs arising from lack of
coordination may be eliminated.
The use of logistics services continues to increase all
around the world, including Turkey, the subject country of
this study. Current and predicted levels of globalization,
with the attendant dispersion of production and consumption
points all around the world, make it impossible for a ﬁrm to
have its own logistics operation, as it is neither sustainable
nor proﬁtable to do so. Nonetheless, although it is almost
obligatory for companies to outsource logistics services,
delivery problems (such as losing track/control of the product, late deliveries, transportation damages, not acting as a
part of the focal company in interactions with the consumers,
etc.) force the focal company to be diligent and selective as
to the ﬁrm with which it chooses to sign logistics services
contracts, and to spend more time on contract parameters. As
a response to this, logistics service providers have started to
put more effort into building relationships with their partners, emphasizing service quality and trust [29]. This
transformation and development is not only inevitable, but
also critical for Turkey’s integration with the world.
Commonly used contract parameters in third-party
logistics include service standards, key performance metrics
and timeline requirements [30]. If the members of a supply
chain start a strategic partnership with the objective of
establishing reciprocal trust and a fair relationship dependent on the processes, then they can handle the problems
and their negative consequences in a more efﬁcient way. It
would be helpful in building a long-term, mutually beneﬁcial, and strong relationship to spend sufﬁcient effort on the
clauses in the analysis phase of the contract, deﬁning the

construction of this strategic partnership. In such relationships, the partners will very rarely and most probably
accidentally fail to fulﬁll their responsibilities and liabilities
or violate contract clauses; nonetheless, protection against
these rare eventualities is preferable.
Moreover, considering the consequences of globalization, analyzing contracts for those ﬁrms operating in
international markets by taking into account cross-country
differences is another interesting research direction. Here,
in addition to the contract parameters found by mathematical models, corrections for differences in culture and
bureaucracy will be required.
