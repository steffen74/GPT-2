Introduction
Management systems are the everyday concern of many organisations. Employees often
seem to be without interest in it. In fact, also management systems are undergoing
development. And the organisation should respond to this development. The problem is
where this trend is going now. Many of them have not yet matched their integration. The
problem is how to monitor and evaluate these changes? Organisations need to maintain
their performance and competitiveness while doing so.

1. Literature research on the integration of management systems
The issue of integrating management systems and efforts to increase organisational
performance is often described in a proffesional literature. The following literature research
presents main directions of this research. Articles (Katou, et al., 2007; Stříteská, et al.,
2016) deal with the management of human resources with an impact on the performance of
the organisation. The first builds a generic effective model mainly for small and mediumsized organisations. The second one hits the hierarchy and multifaceted ties and its
incoherence with the strategy. The study (Busco, et al., 2008) describes the role of
management systems in integrating organisations. It addresses integration and internal
adaptation and recommends building a shared strategy. The text (Sirkis, et al., 2011)
presents a review of the environmental supply chain management according to various
theories, focusing on the internal state of organisations and their substantial surroundings.
The text (Darnall, et al., 2008) examines the relationship between the environmental
management system and the business performance in a context of internal motivation and
external pressures of institutions. The article (Melnyk, et al., 2003) deals with this
relationship, but with regard to waste reduction and inclusion of all stages of product life
and certification of the management system. A framework for the integration of the logistic
chain is proposed by the article (Bichou, et al., 2004). The study (Waddock, et al., 2002)
describes the main pressures in organisational management and a comprehensive
management framework. The link between integrated risk management and strategy is
described in the article (Bromiley, et al., 2015). The study (Castel-Peces del, et al., 2017)
describes the implementation of the industry standard for aeronautics and aerospace quality
throughout the manufacturing process. The paper (Jaca, et al., 2015) describes the
implementation of TQM in a service organisation and the same topic is in the library in the
text (Düren, 2012). The article (Tomaževič, et al., 2017) develops an integrated model of
public administration performance management. The article (Virglerová, et al., 2017)
describes key factors of the corporate environment in small and medium-sized
organisations in the Czech Republic. Linking knowledge and innovation through TQM in
the spirit of performance and sustainability is in the text (Hung, et al., 2010). Similarly,
decision support for product development with respect to system performance is solved by
the study (Marques, et al., 2011). The framework for understanding the safety culture of gas
and oil organisations is dealt in the article (Parker, et al., 2006). It creates a descriptive tool
that serves as a self-assessment. The quality of change management services is mentioned
in the text (Scharitzer, et al., 2010). This research is focused on the identification and
implementation of continuous improvement of the management system (Mc Lean, et al.,
2017). The information security management system as a support for the sustainability of
procedures is described in a model in the article (Petrini, et al., 2009). The information
about planning phase is an essential. The problem is to link reality to the workshops with
relation to the performance of an organisation in the supply chain is examined by the text
(Yawar, et al., 2017). Confidence and commitment are essential. The article (Jørgensen,
2008) describes the integration of quality management systems, environmental and
occupational safety systems. It emphasizes the need for internal willingness to integrate. It
draws attention to the need to involve lifestyle changes in order to develop the
sustainability of management systems. It defines the degree of system integration that
similarly the book (Pelantová, et al., 2014) describes. The measurability of products,
processes, and management systems depends on tracking the values of specified characters.
The study (Marques, et al., 2011) uses traditional costs, time and quality. The article
(Bichou, et al., 2004) deals only with basic costs and customer satisfaction. The study
(Castel-Peces del, et al., 2017) sees a foundation in product quality and safety. The
characters in the article (Virglerová, et al., 2017) are given by its focus on financial features
and risks associated with them, such as costs, public perceptions, knowledge of bank and
state rules. The text (Scharitzer, et al., 2010) emphasizes the satisfaction of employees and
then customers. Other examples of enumeration are more extensive. The article (Katou, et
al., 2007) uses features: training, fairness among employees, motivation and interests of
employees, information sharing and work safety. The performance is measured by value
added and financial characters. The text (Sirkis, et al., 2011) emphasizes social systems and
related features: links, productivity, environmental and financial features. The article
(Melnyk, et al., 2003) evaluates the cost, product quality, amount of waste during its design
and processing, delivery times and other unspecified environmental parameters. The text
(Jaca, et al., 2015) provides multiple characters when it follows: good management
practices, processes, employee quality, customer orientation, knowledge, education,
financial characters, operational and production performance. The text (Yawar, et al., 2017)
tracks communication, compliance, suppliers' performance and financial performance. The
article (Jørgensen, 2008) selects features from areas such as learning, improvement,
stakeholder behavior and synergy between areas. The publication (Darnall, et al., 2008)
measures the number of inspections, the number of violations, coercive measures, the
public's relation to the organisation, the involvement of employees. Publication (Düren,
2012) sees a management style, interest of employees on changes, sharing of vision,
supporting a group and stimulating it. The organisation should in (McLan, et al., 2017)
focus on the following characters: expectations, leadership, training, employee engagement,
culture and environment, way of implementation, project management, feedback, results.
Social and environmental characters are linked to the sustainability strategy and financial
features while using the information security in the article (Petrini, et al., 2009).
Implementation, use and integration of management systems pose a number of problems.
The most frequently mentioned are listed here. Managers for example exaggerate their
environmental outcomes and do not report problems with their strategies according to the
publication (Darnall, et al., 2008). Furthermore, some of the countries do not measure the
same features and make comparability is therefore more difficult. There is also the effect of
national cultures. The article (Melnyk, et al., 2003) hampers the difficult acquisition of
environmental data. Few organisations have established social responsibility and almost do
not report sustainability reports, as written in the article (Jørgensen, 2008). The article
(Bromiley, et al., 2015) shows little emphasis on risk management and concerns about its
effectiveness for some incidents. Many of organisations according to articles (Stříteská, et
al., 2016; Castel-Peces del, et al., 2017) solve the market and financial measures rather than
soft motives like employee development or innovation. They are aware of their impact on
quality. Knowledge of financial risks in organisations is limited, for example in the article
(Virglerová, et al., 2017). Efforts to continual improvement often result in downtime, as
the text (Mc Lean, et al., 2017) says. The article (Petrini, et al., 2009) recalls limited
possibilities of existing SW support.
There are many theories in the field of system management concepts and integration of
these systems, which need further research, such as text (Sirkis, et al., 2011). The study
(Castel-Peces del, et al., 2017) recommends conducting similar studies elsewhere in the
world to compare the experience of implementing system standards, motivation, and
positively impacting organisations. Similarly, there is an article on financial risk issues
(Virglerová, et al., 2017). It also recommends focusing on groups of respondents rather
than managers. According to the article (Bromiley, et al., 2015), the relationship between
different types of strategies and risk management, as well as the interaction of the
organisation's overall risk management system and the way of implementation, need to be
examined. According to the context in the article (Yawar, et al., 2017), it is necessary to
examine the exchange of information, mechanisms of trust, power and engagement among
stakeholders in terms of performance and, in particular, social features. The interconnection
of the environment and the performance of the organisation is more important over time,
for example, according to the article (Darnall, et al., 2008). The study (Waddock, et al.,
2002) clearly identifies the new trend of joining economic, social and environmental
spheres. This moves further in the article (Petrini, et al., 2009) linking social responsibility
and sustainability in the organisation's vision. An information security is provided by
communication channels. The need for sufficient time and training of employees is
mentioned in articles (Castel-Peces del, et al., 2017; Tomaževič, et al., 2017). The article
(Jørgensen, 2008) deals with an increase the degree of compatibility of basic management
systems standards.

2. Discussion on literature research
The above-mentioned literature research brings a lot of knowledge. The field of research on
aspects of integration of management systems is rather broad. In this article, both authors
will illuminate some inconsistencies and, on the contrary, will highlight follow-on issues to
support an appropriate direction for organisations to integrate systems. In practice, the
demanding boundary of systems is solved by a case study in the text (Busco, et al., 2008)
by centralization, which is not appropriate in the long time run. The article (Bichou, et al.,
2004) integrates processes and functions, which contradicts the process approach that is the
basis for quality systems. The publication (Darnall, et al., 2008) describes, for example, the
situation of the US environmental system that is more complex than European one, but it
does not consider the influence of people in the leadership of the states in this issue.
Contrary to the study (Waddock, et al., 2002), where there is a great pressure on
environmental improvement of stakeholder practices, the situation is more moderate. In
study (Marques, et al., 2011), a well-structured task is based on the decision-making
support of product development, which is unknown with regard to the network of
stakeholders involved. It should be at least a partially structured task. In addition, emphasis
should be placed on prevention rather than on correction by corrective actions. In addition
to the one-respondent, the article (Katou, et al., 2007) still has an unresolved area of
information security, environment and social responsibility. However, the article (Petrini, et
al., 2009) deals with these areas and also points to the learning and support of discovering
the BSC. However, this model will still have to be explored. It can be added that such a
system should be considered as soft one. Problematic in this article is the thinking of the
governing structure, which is somewhat against the process approach. The study (Waddock,
et al., 2002) presents a novelty in management systems for the Czech Republic. It
interconnects financial, environmental and social aspects and adds a new management
framework. In the text (Melnyk, et al., 2003), the degradation of waste is correctly related
to the entire life cycle of the product as it corresponds to the reliability management system.
Similarly, this is underlined by the article (Jørgensen, 2008). There has been saturation in
the interviews on safety culture according to the article (Parker, et al., 2006), but the above
problems do not correspond. Risk management in the article (Bromiley, et al., 2015) in an
integrated management system will require time to stabilize. Basically, it's new because it is
normative and all management systems need it now. Compared to the article (Jørgensen,
2008), the product relationship to the environment and the supplier's assessment should be a
part of the 1st level of system integration, which corresponds to the finding of the book
(Pelantová, et al., 2014). However, this article does not consider the security of
information. Overall, most publications still talk about human resources, even though it is
an asset. An incomplete transition to the process approach and re-classification of the
control process (e.g. in articles (Castel-Peces del, et al., 2017; Tomaževič, et al., 2017)) can
be seen. Descriptions of changes in relationships with systems will need to be better
grasped. The integration will not require only the creation of new management tools. The
first one, for example, models are in the article (Madzík, 2016), although they focus mainly
on customers. The article (Stříteská, et al., 2016) rightly mentions that the review of the
management system is little used. In the Czech Republic, the performance of the
organisation is solved regardless of culture, communication and measurement of this
overall performance, but the world is already dealing with the sustainability. This is a
higher degree of management system development than their simple integration. For
organisations, this means changes in organisational structure and lifestyle changes for
people in the state. Contrary to the article (Stříteská, et al., 2016) and according to the
experience of this authors and the text (Castel-Peces del, et al., 2017), large organisations
may have an inefficient management system and small organisations have management
systems an efficient one. To reinforce this fact, for example, the publication (Düren, 2012)
recommends to take employees as experts for their work and to trust them. This is useful in
building processes. As it can be seen not only from the text (Mc Lean, et al., 2017), the way
of implementation and some other aspects of management systems will have to be revised
to achieve right successes. Existing concepts have the same and already reduced
management principles. It can be assumed that the concepts of management systems, e.g.
TQM and ISO 9000 series, will continue to converge. Consequently, these concepts are
explored together, although the ISO 9000 concept prevails in the Czech Republic. TQM is
for the whole of its existence more concerned with soft systems. And that is the core to
ensure the sustainability of management systems. Therefore, the TQM can be a model for
the ISO 9000 concept. In addition, it can be assumed that there will be further
interconnection of different types of management systems. This is mainly improved by the
latest revision of standards with emphasis on joint risk management. The basis of
integration should be the process approach, which is consistent with findings in the book
(Pelantová, et al., 2014) and is also in line with TQM. For organisations, it is therefore
necessary to set out basic features that are relevant to this issue. The result of this article

should therefore be to establish basic recommendations for a sustainable management
system for the organisation.

3. Characteristics of organisations
For this article, data from 10 randomly selected organisations were used. This is a partial
survey of two authors' workplaces, which has been going on longer. Organisations are
located throughout the Czech Republic. From this sample there were 5 small and mediumsized organisations (up to 250 employees) and 5 large organisations. Different sectors of
the national economy are represented by food industry (10 %), mechanical engineering
(30 %), automotive (20 %), automation (10 %), education (10 %) and public service
(10 %). It counts with organisations performing piece production (30 %), serial production
(20 %) and even mass (50 %) of their products. Production organisations account for 70 %
and the rest are non-production organisations. Organisations have established core quality
management systems, work safety, etc. Most (90 %) are reviewing, but only a fraction
(30 %) have experience with the EFQM model. By their internal culture, organisations are
distinguished from good relationships and respect for the personal needs of the employee,
through reorganisation and rationalization of work to an overtime work, a leadership
dominance and overlook of nonconformities. 40 % of organisations were formed before
1989 year (the revolution) and 60 % of organisations after it. All organisations are
economically efficient. Nevertheless, 30 % of organisations are investing fully in the
facility and 50 % partially, and 40 % invest in HR training fully and 40 % partially.

4. Management systems and sustainability characteristics
To assess management systems of each organisation, their characters were used. At first,
common characters about organisations were used. However, after closer examination, the
data do not seem to cover the entire system complexly. They are one-sided. Therefore, the
brainstorming method was chosen to assign each management system and find new set of
characters. It was based on a complex view of individual components of management
systems. E.g. for the Occupational Safety and Health Management System, characters
were: the number of incidents, the number of fatal incidents, the use of personal protective
equipment, the cost of work safety, the safety of the employees. This list has been set for
the quality management system, the environment, information security, financial
management and organisation performance, but also for social responsibility and even for
sustainability. Corporate Social Responsibility has emerged from the available Global
Compact, ISO 26000 and SA 8000 standards. Some elements such as "health and safety",
such as the SA 8000, correspond to a different management system and are therefore
included in this system. Subsequently, the following features were chosen: gender, free
working time, freedom of association, social commitment, report, transparency, employee
satisfaction. The sustainability has emerged from its definition as the organisation's
responsibility for its impact on the public and other studies, for example (Kratochvíl and
Cílek, 2005) and authors' own research. From there, the sustainability is essentially an
extension of the environmental management system with a holistic overlap. For
sustainability, the following characters have been identified: employee modesty,
heterarchy, project thinking, constraint awareness, caution, landscape perception, long-term
perspective, friendliness. Followed by the character analysis of the integrated management
extensive. It turns out that in common thinking in organisational practice, characters are
chosen across management systems, but most are leadership and financial management and
quality. Conversely, the sustainability often disappears and social responsibility is rather
limited. This is probably the consequence of applying the hierarchical organisational
structure and the directive style of management. Moreover, these issues are not even wider
public awareness. Even the heterarchy and the professional public do not talk much about a
sustainability. Here the heterarchy affects management, information sharing, long-term
strategy, motivation, education, relationship to risks and time. Modesty of a employee
influences, for example, savings and the principle of win to win, which is promoted in
social responsibility. Social responsibility and sustainability include predominantly soft
features that are of a qualitative nature. Such characters are worse measured. E.g. employee
engagement can be interpreted differently as true dedication, but in some organisations, it
leads to submissiveness and enforcement, etc. Coercive actions, on the other hand, are a
negative chracter and are inherently inexhaustible. Therefore, positive characters have been
selected in the shortcut selection. The product quality corresponds to customer
requirements. The satisfaction of the customer corresponds to the satisfaction of all its
needs. The number of incidents OSH is the number of all injuries and deaths due to work
activity. The number of incidents ISMS is the number of all loss, damage and theft of data
and intrusions into computer systems. The amount of waste corresponds to all waste from
production and non-production activities. Recyclability of the product is the possibility of
disasembly and ecological processing of all parts. Water consumption corresponds to the
measurement of water for production and other activities by a water meter. The employee
satisfaction is the satisfaction of the employee due to his work and relationship enthusiasm
and the safety situation in the organisation and respect for his interests. The process
transparency is the degree of perception of elements and links and other parts of the process
by the observer. The modesty of employee corresponds to the demand for goods and is
related to the nature. The heterarchy is a kind of organisational structure that suppresses
supremacy. Awareness of the limitation corresponds to the level of knowledge of
employees about the exhaustiveness of all resources. Cost savings are financial savings of
all activities of the organisation that do not lead to a decrease in quality or safety. The longterm perspective is the planning and control of organisation's activities over a period of
time, for example, over hundred years. The prevention of non-conformities is the ability to
predict and overcome events that would lead to nonconformities by actions. Their inventory
is in table no.1.
Respondents of a controlled interview on the status of management systems in selected
organisations are their regular staff in positions of technicians and workers who are familiar
with the subject matter under consideration. They are not managers. They provided
extensive background information on organisation's management systems. This information
is the basis for further exploration. Results obtained were more realistic and included more
details on the production and operation of the workplaces on the technical, personnel and
system side. This was followed by the evaluation of individual characters, as aspects of
organisations. It corresponds to markings as at school. The value 1 is the best and 5 is the
worst. The true is that the worse the mark is, more nonconformities occur in the system.
The assignment is as follows: 1 - The excellent result, there are clear reactions of
employees and of the surrounding area. 2 - The untouched outcome to perfection, but the
state of view is satisfactory for all parties. 3 - Medium result, the solution is half the

expectation. 4 - Sufficient result is an effort to solve, but it is not, or vice versa, a solution
just before the error in terms of classical theory of systems. 5 - Bad, misleading or no result.
The O and the number indicates a specific organisation. The organisation can score
between 15 and 75 points. Ratings were made by authors. It is therefore subjective.
However, it is sufficient for an initial idea of the subject under consideration.
From table no. 1 the following results are apparent. Common characters like product
quality and customer satisfaction are fairly fine. Both types of security are at a good level
relatively. It is clear that characters such as waste and recycling do not work so well in
organisations, but the care is growing. A more attention is paid to the consumption of water
(and electricity) because costs incurred and the involvement of the industry standard are
known. Employee satisfaction in many organisations is declining. The transparency of
processes is a long-time undervalued parameter, and the status is partly inaccurate with the
process approach. The modesty of an employeer is aggravated. The heterarchy appears to
be a big problem, as the hierarchical structure prevails in organisations. Awareness of the
constraint is on a middle-class among employees. Cost savings are slightly better than the
previous one. The long-term perspective seems to be problematic. It should correspond to
the organisation's strategy in the longer term than the current average of 5 years. The
prevention of nonconformities is a very diverse according to organisations. The average
rating of organisations in the sum of the marks is based almost 37 points. Critical characters
show other characters than usual in many analyzes (see research). This is also confirmed by
the Triangle Table tool. Impacts of the sustainability and the social responsibility and the
environment are stronger in management systems, although they are often underestimated.
Why are these results coming out and what are their causes? The goal of characters is 1.
The quality of a product is the worst for O6 because there is a strong hierarchy and
demands of customers and staff are not understood.

A low satisfaction of the customer is due to poor performance (like O6). A bad situation of
the number of incidents OSH in O1 and O3 is due to an unclear hierarchy and a
complicated production, on the contrary the heterarchy leads to their reduction (O5). The
number of ISMS incidents is due to a combination of many orders and nonconformities
(like O2), while a large surplus of finances and staff can lead to improvements (O3 and
O9). The amount of waste is the result of disruption in production and a lack of leadership
(like O6). Recyclability of the product is comparable and average in almost all
organisations, due to construction and manufacturing technologies, the same cost savings.
Water consumption is also average, only O2 is noticeably higher due to an inappropriate
technology. Satisfaction of the employee is a bad one, mainly due to poor interpersonal
relationships, administrative increase, and a lack of clarity (O1). On the other hand, the
heterarchy, good relationships and respect for employee interests lead to improvement (O5
and O8). A large hierarchy, complex management systems, and PPCs lead to a poor
trasparency of process (O6). A large, relatively prosperous organisation in the big city and
an inappropriate example of managers can lead to modesty of employee (O3 and O10). The
hierarchy is an opposite of the heterarchy, so the organisation can have only one of them.
Awareness of the restrictions is given by material stock limits. People can not think of a
long time because they are pressed for a fast work and a fast consumption. The prevention
of nonconformities corresponds to the number of incidents in the organisation (the worst in
O1). The hierarchical structure is embraced and de facto enforced by legislation,
management tools, schools, SW. The market leads a person to a fast production, a fast
consumption and use now, regardless of the surroundings. The waste is still where to go.
The consequences of its effects are still not seen by many as a burden. What will be in few
years is not interested. Awareness of the limitation is overtaken because resources are still
available. People think it's going to come up with something in the meantime and the world
will work forever. The social responsibility is also under consideration because a customer
satisfaction is still being solved and the employee is a human resource, often a machine. He
must be subordinate, not have personal needs. Considering the other is not modern. This,
however, leads to the collapse of a personal life and then to the loss of productivity and
invention. This situation is hampered by organisations because it leads to the growth of
nonconformities and security incidents. The modesty of employee is not perceived as a
virtue. There is often an idea of family, team, organisation being abused. Newly selected
characters are therefore well-founded, but they will still have to be promoted in
organisations. This article should help to solve this.

5. Model EFQM and sustainability - the research methodology
Management systems in the Czech Republic are not evaluated with the EFQM model often.
Therefore, a comparative analysis of the EFQM model requirements with the theoretical

integrated management system described in the sample of characters presented above was
performed. The following facts arise:
 The Leadership is a good if it is perceived in the sense of coaching and heterarchy.
 The Policy and Strategy criterion depends on the needs of stakeholders, whether they
are in line with the social responsibility and the sustainability. The criterion is a repetition
of obvious things, and in organisations it was often conceived formally.
 The criterion Employees is already influenced by the concept of a employee as a
human resource, but one should be the asset of an organisation. In point 3a), human
resources are managed when people should be guided.
 The Partnership and Resources criterion in point 4b) deals primarily with financial
management of resources and technologies, but there is no a more mention of the
sustainability of resources in a holistic view.
 The criterion Processes and Products in item 5d) writes "products in accordance with
customer requirements", but the interest of other stakeholders is not sufficiently considered.
 The Customer Satisfaction criterion meets the requirements of this group only.
 The criterion Results for Employees is a problematic. The point 7a) corresponds to
the perception of the employee as a subordinate in terms of EFQM. The point 7b) refers to
factors such as motivation, engagement, absence, morbidity and accidents, but this can be
influenced by the style of driving and incidents. So employees may not be responsible.
 The Sociaty-Results criterion in the point 8a) has an interest in promoting corporate
social responsibility because it mentions reports, equal opportunities, ethics, environmental
pollution, etc. The point 8b), on the contrary, is a more legislative and mediatory, and does
not lead to a new trend. However there is an effort.
 The criterion Key Performance Outcomes are a financial purely and in fact against
the social responsibility and the sustainability.
The current EFQM model has 9 criterions. In particular, more-valued criterions Customer
Satisfaction and Key Performance Outcomes of the EFQM model do not match
sustainability and security and little address social responsibility. Thus, the tool teaches
organisations to be a more market-oriented, regardless of soft aspects. This contradicts
above-mentioned trends in the development of management systems. Already some small
organisations are struggling with this fact. They are also burdened with extensive criterions.
Some parts are in fact duplicate, mainly the Employee and Results for Employees, as well
as Leadership and Key Performance Outcomes. That is why it needs to propose at least the
modification of this model in the sense of a sustainable management system. This is a
transformation of organisational circuits, as shown in the figure no. 1 which interferes with
the internal environment as well as with the substantial surroundings of organisations. In
relation to a philosophical basis of TQM, following recommendations can be proposed:
 The implementation of flexible organisational structures into organisations. Extend
strategic management even in turbulent times with regard to the sustainability of places in
the landscape and in the organisation, otherwise brownfields are created over time. The
strategic thinking is now shortened to about 5 years, but it should be related to, for
example, rules of Indians or foresters in the Czech Republic for at least 100 years to make
sense, which is in line with natural events and the time of decay of simpler products.
packaging and transport. This also addresses recycling. This is pushing on logistics. Try to
keep untouched resources in the countryside and raw materials to draw mainly from the
waste and from renewable sources.
 Customers are all receiving parts (e.g. by air, by water). It is necessary to balance life
and work and to perceive the employee as a person with his / her knowledge and skills that
are of benefit to organisations. Employees create "satisfied customers".
 It is necessary to teach children to be modest and to show them modest heroes and
also to adults in organisations.
 It is a matter of course to perceive implications of each job as prescribed by TQM.
Adopting of the idea of sustainability in an organisation's culture prevents the introduction
of a sustainable management system. Lifecycle management and self-control are aspects of
the new management.

The newly designed EFQM model should be a simpler and a more comprehensible and
consistent with the standard ISO 9001. It is composed of 6 criterion. Its diagram shows the
figure no. 2. The larger EFQM model does not lead to better management. Leadership is
rather coaching. Employees must also be aware of their work safety. The knowledge
management can be included here, which is associated with them. Sustainability and
environment are the Sources and Partners criterion, therefore stakeholders. Strategy 100
and Risk is a criterion involving a long-term strategy, but also risk management in a holistic
approach to internal and external context. The Processes and Products criterion should
address the area of quality, industry standards and information security. The new
Sustainability criterion includes, for example the above set of characters, which can be
assessed and improved in detail. The basis should be the process approach. The result
should not be maximum finance and minimum time, but ensured sustainability while the
satisfaction of stakeholders.
The EFQM Sustainable Model Questionnaire is then followed:
 Leadership – Leaders develop a vision and a sustainable strategy with regard to
stakeholders. The leader develops and fills the management system with respect to the
process approach and the heterarchy (win to win principle, dialogue). The leader is a model
of culture, ethically and safely acting. The leader is the coach of the employees. Leaders
provide resources and organisational information on time.
 Employees – The employee develops his / her knowledge and skills. The employee
carries out and develops processes with regard to stakeholders. The employee is rewarded,
acknowledged, communicated, and cared for. The employee feels a secure.
 Resources and Partners – Partnerships with stakeholders are managed and their
satisfaction and opinion are being investigated. It is dedicated to the care of premises,
environments, equipment, materials and raw materials, with emphasis on safety, small costs
and cleanliness. Useful technologies are used. Information and knowledge are controlled
and protected. Financial resources are managed.
 Strategy and Risks – A full organisation risk analysis is performed regularly and
actions are measured and implemented. The strategy builds on established characters of the
management and product system, learning, and surveys. The decisions taken should be
considered with a long-term perspective. Prevention of nonconformities is taken into
account and, where appropriate, disposed of.
 Processes and products – Processes are designed to be transparent and gentle, and
are systematically monitored by features and maintained with regard to internal needs as
well as to the state of the surrounding environment. Products are designed, built and
upgraded to meet needs and expectations of stakeholders as good and secure. Products are
serviced. The products are well recyclable.
 Sustainability results – It is considered the lifecycle of all elements of the
organisation and thus the awareness of the constraints. Elements are regularly maintained.
Employee modesty and the principle of win to win are supported. Precautions and a holistic
decision making are in place for both processes and products. Resource savings are
monitored and ensured.

The sustainability is a concept that engenders a great debate in the public. From the point of
view of the reliability management, it is a simple effort to keep the system (here
management) for a long time in a functioning state and to balance possible discrepancies in
a way acceptable to the internal system and the environment. This article, in this spirit,
proposes foundations for the sustainable management system in relation to the substantial
neighbourhood. This is, of course, the nature and stakeholders. The analysis of sample of
management systems was carried out by organisations to determine their sustainability
status and sustainability characters. Small organisations with a flexible organisational
structure are doing better even in the sustainability. In addition, an existing EFQM model
for assessing of management systems against sustainability requirements was analysed.
Based on the basics of the TQM concept, appropriate recommendations have been
proposed for this area. Finally, the sustainable EFQM model was designed.
The analysis of organisation management systems points to nonconformities and, in
particular, unpreparedness in some areas of management systems that have not yet received
sufficient attention. Authors, of course, have coped with the issue of organisational
performance. They take the view that it is not an essential whether the organisation is
profitable now. The question is whether it will be in 10 or 100 years and whether people
around will be satisfied. A number of organisations are now profiting, but values of
characters point to significant nonconformities in the interpersonal field and hence
production nonconformities. The performance is so jeopardized. This, in fact, shows results
of the sample survey of organisations. The set of suggested characters is a small but an
actionable. Proposals are made in accordance with the process approach. The proposed
sustainable EFQM model is a smaller but a more comprehensive than the existing solution.
In particular, organisations save the time in processing due to fewer criterions and thus
savings in finances. It is also designed for employees in a comprehensible form. The access
(documentation), the redistribution (appraisal) and the assessment (measurement and
settlement), as well as the calculation, are maintained as employees are accustomed too.
The proposal is debugged in one of these organisations.
Despite all efforts, authors managed to process only a part of the large area of the
sustainability of management systems. In addition, the range is limited by the scope of this
contribution. Further organisational analysis will be needed with regard to the
sustainability. It will be necessary to revise these characters in relation to the substantial
neighbourhood. Characters must be set specifically for the organisation, whereas the set
here is general. In addition, a detailed risk analysis will be required. Therefore, the
proposed concept of sustainability will certainly change. A legislative support and a public
awareness will be needed to make the new trend in management systems easier for
organisations. This is why this article is significant.
