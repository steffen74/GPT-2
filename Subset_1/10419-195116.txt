The basic production planning problem of a single item with returns options is commonly


periods and quantities of manufacturing and remanufacturing in order to meet the demand
requirements on time, minimizing the sum of costs involved for carrying out the production
activities and for holding inventory of both used and serviceable (new and remanufactured)
items. Hybrid production-remanufacturing systems have been drawing the attention of both
practitioners and researchers since the late twentieth century, motivated mainly by the adverse
impact of conventional production on the environment [20]. Among recovery options of used
products, remanufacturing is an industry process for which it is warranted that the
remanufactured items offer at least the same quality and functionality than those newly
manufactured [20]. Related benefits of remanufacturing include: energy and labour savings,
low sale prices, reduction in the use of raw materials and extension of the useful life of
products [4, 10, 23, 34]. This results in most cases in a win-win-win situation for manufacturers, customers and environment [12, 15, 16]. Besides the economic and environmental
drivers for remanufacturing, there may be legal and market pressures, which are often the true
reasons for manufacturers to become involved with remanufacturing. Currently it is usual for
take-back legislations to include collection targets for returns and soon it may also include
mandatory recovery targets [6, 7, 13, 17]. Certain market pressures such as product protection,
may cause that original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) decide to recover all the used
products of his brand from the market to avoid third-party remanufacturing [2]. On the other
hand, environment friendly companies can establish a recovery target of the used products
collected as high as possible in order to reduce the disposing of them. For example, BreezeEastern company remanufactures all the returns collected, i.e. a recovery target of 100%, as
part of its sustainability strategy [3]. In addition, a company can set a certain level of recovery
because the returns have no value beyond the planning horizon [3] or to make proper use of the
installed remanufacturing capacity.
Motivated by the reasons exposed above, in this paper, we tackle the economic lot-sizing
problem with remanufacturing and recovery targets (ELSR-RT). The recovery target is stated as
a lower bound on the numbers of returns that must be remanufactured. According to our best
knowledge this ELSR extension with dynamic demand and return values has not yet been
considered in the literature. We first show that this problem extension can be formulated as a
generalization of the traditional problem without recovery targets. Secondly, we propose and
evaluate a polynomial-time heuristic procedure for the ELSR-RT that is based on determining
the most suitable periods for remanufacturing. To evaluate the heuristic, we extend a benchmark
set of large instances of the literature to include different recovery target and cost settings.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 is devoted to the literature review of
lot-sizing problems with remanufacturing. In Section 3 we provide the mathematical formulation and the heuristic procedure for the ELSR-RT. Section 4 provides the specification and
the results of the numerical experiment carried out for evaluating the heuristic procedure.
Finally, Section 5 presents the conclusions and some directions for future research.

Literature review
Richter and Sombrutzki [29] and Richter and Weber [30] analyse the ELSR under sufficient
returns in the first period for covering the demand requirements. Golany et al. [9] present a

41

is also NP-hard and provide a heuristic procedure of O(T4) time. Van den Heuvel [36] shows
that ELSR is NP-hard for the case of set-up and unit costs for the activities and unit costs for
holding inventory, even under time-invariant cost values. Teunter et al. [35] consider the ELSR
with joint and separate set-up costs for the production and remanufacturing. An exact
algorithm of O(T4) is provided for the case of joint set-up costs. For the case of separate setup costs, they adapt and compare three well-known heuristics of the inventory control
literature. Later, Schulz [31] extends and improves the work of [35] about the Silver-Meal
heuristic. Retel-Helmrich et al. [28] provide and compare different mathematical formulations
for the ELSR with both separate and joint set-up costs. Piñeyro and Viera [24] suggest and
compare several inventory policies for the ELSR using the divide-and-conquer approach,
including a Tabu Search-based on procedure. Li et al. [14] also provide a Tabu Search-based
on procedure for the ELSR, which requires solving an LP formulation. Baki et al. [3] suggest a
heuristic based on a dynamic programming approach for the ELSR. In Sifaleras et al. [33]
different Variable Neighborhood Search (VNS) based on procedures are suggested and
compared. They also provide a benchmark set of large instances for the ELSR. Piñeyro and
Viera [26] provides an optimized version of the Tabu Search procedure of [24] considering a
new theoretical result about the optimal solutions of the ELSR. Cunha and Melo [5] propose
and evaluate different MILP formulations for the ELSR with the aim of solving larger
instances with standard solvers. Sifaleras and Konstantaras [32] suggest a VNS procedure
for a multi-item extension of the ELSR.
Several authors have considered extensions of the ELSR. Pan et al. [22] address a dynamic
lot-sizing problem with returns recovery and capacity constraints. Mitra [21] analyzes a twoechelon inventory system with returns. Piñeyro and Viera [25] consider the ELSR with
substitution of remanufactured products by new ones but not viceversa. Fergurson et al. [8]
and Mahapatra et al. [19] consider hybrid production-remanufacturing systems with returns
quality assumptions. Hilger et al. [11] consider a production planning problem of multiple items
with remanufacturing and capacity constraints under uncertainty. Akartunali and Arulselvan [1]
suggest a polynomial time algorithm for the ELSR with high-cost returns. Zouadi et al. [40]
consider a hybrid production-remanufacturing system with different suppliers for returns and
considering carbon emission constraints. Polotski et al. [27] analyse a hybrid productionremanufacturing system of a single machine, assuming constant demand and returns rates
and a large amount of returns. Zikopoulos [39] proposes a model to capture the remanufacturing
lead-times depending on the returns quality uncertainty, assuming constant demand and returns
rates. Macedo et al. [18] propose different MILP formulations for a multi-item extension of the
ELSR with uncertainty in the parameters, backlogging and final disposing.
The literature about lot-sizing with remanufacturing and recovery targets is scarce.
Esenduran et al. [6] study the effect of three distinct levels of legislations on the
(re)manufacturing and collection decisions: no take-back legislation, legislation with collection
targets only, and legislations with both collection and reuse/remanufacturing targets. The
model proposed is for the case of single-product, single-period and steady-state situation.
More recently, Esenduran et al. [7] present a similar study but considering also an independent
remanufacturing firm in competition with the OEM. According to our best knowledge, Kwak
[13] is the only paper of the ELSR literature dealing with recovery targets on the
remanufacturing activity. The author proposes a bi-objective profit model for a multi-item


Methods
Problem statement
We consider a dynamic lot-sizing problem of a single item in which the demand of each period
over a finite planning must be satisfied on time either by producing new items or by
remanufacturing used ones returned to the origin. In addition, there is a recovery target stated
as a fraction of the total number of returns that must be at least remanufactured within the
planning horizon. We assume that set-up costs related to the production activities as well as the
holding inventory costs for used and serviceable items are time-invariant. Unit costs for
production and remanufacturing are not considered as it is assumed that under stationary
costs, the lot-sizing decisions in the long term only affect set-up and holding costs [35]. Lead
times and initial inventory level of both used and serviceable products are assumed zero and
backlogging is not allowed. The objective is to determine the quantities to produce and
remanufacture at each period in order to meet the demand requirements on time and the
recovery target, minimizing the sum of the involved costs. We use the following notation
hereafter.

The objective function of (1) is the sum of all the involved costs. Constraints (2) and (3) are
the inventory equilibrium equations for serviceable and used items, respectively. Constraints
(4) and (5) indicate that a set-up is made whenever an activity is carried out in a period for a
strictly positive quantity. Constraint (6) states that the initial inventory-level for both serviceable and used items is zero. Constraint (7) states the recovery target as a fraction of the total
returns that must be at least remanufactured. Finally, constraints (8) indicate the set of possible
values for each decision variable.
Formulation (1)–(8) except by constraint (7) refers to the problem without recovery targets
and it is similar to those of [3, 26, 33, 35] for the ELSR. Thus, the ELSR-RT as formulated
above can be considered a generalization of the ELSR. The ELSR is an NP-hard problem in
general and even under stationary function costs as we are assuming here [3]. Therefore, it is
unlikely that we can develop any efficient time procedure for determining an optimal solution
of the ELSR-RT. Considering this complexity result, we suggest below a heuristic procedure
for solving the ELSR-RT with the aim of obtaining near-optimal solutions in a reasonable
computation time.

Heuristic procedure for the ELSR-RT
We present here the heuristic procedure suggested for the ELSR-RT as it was defined in
Section 3.1 of above. The heuristic is based on determining the most suitable periods for
remanufacturing one at a time. Two different criteria are used for determining these periods,
which in fact leads to two different variants of the heuristic. Note that the heuristic can be also
applied to the traditional ELSR, since an ELSR instance can be considered an ELSR-RT
instance with zero-recovery target.
The procedure takes as input an ELSR-RT instance, and begins by determining an initial
solution for the particular case of zero remanufacturing. The initialization phase is followed by
an iterative phase with the aim of obtaining a feasible solution of high quality. At each step of
the iterative phase, a new solution is obtained from the current one by means of chosen a


improved. Otherwise, period i is chosen according to one of the two following criteria: the
period leading to a new solution with the lowest cost (minimum-cost-period criterion), or that
for which a new solution is obtained that minimizes the ratio between the total cost and the
number of returns truly remanufactured (more-effective-period criterion). Henceforth, we refer
as H-MCP and H-MEP to the heuristic variants defined by the criteria of minimum-cost-period
and more-effective-period, respectively. The iterative phase ends when either it is not possible
to determine a new period i that meets the conditions of above or all the periods have been
fixed as positive remanufacturing periods.
In order to determine the remanufacturing quantity of a period i chosen for positive
remanufacturing, we use the remanufacturing rule of [24]: the minimum between the amount
of available returns in period i and the accumulative demand from period i to period (j – 1),
with j the next period fixed as positive-remanufacturing period or equal to (T + 1) if i is the last
period of positive remanufacturing. Formally, the rule can be formulated as follows:
À
Á
ri ¼ min yu þ Ri ; Dið j−I Þ ; 1 ≤i < j≤ T þ 1
ð9Þ
i−1
The remanufacturing rule of (9) has been used successfully in [24–26]. Finally, we use the
algorithm of Wagner and Within [37] for determining the optimal production plan [24]. Thus,
the complexity order of the suggested heuristic procedure is O(T 4) since there are O(T)
iterations in the worst case, at each iteration there are O(T) periods to be chosen for positive
remanufacturing and the remanufacturing and production plans can be determined in (O(T) +
O(T 2)) time.

Results and discussion
A benchmark set of large instances for the ELSR has been provided by Sifaleras et al. [33],
available in http://users.uom.gr/~sifalera/benchmarks.html (last access: 23/02/2018). This
benchmark set consists of 108 instances of 52 periods and was designed as follows. The setup costs values for both production activities are 200, 500 and 2000. Holding cost values for of
used items are 0.2, 0.5 and 0.8 and the holding cost for serviceable items is normalized in a
single value equal to 1. Demand values follow a normal distribution of mean 100 per period.
Returns values also follow a normal distribution but three different means of 30, 50 and 70 are
considered. The coefficient of variation of the normal distributions can be of 10 and 20%
(small and large variance respectively).
We extend the benchmark set provided in [33] to evaluate the proposed heuristic under
different scenarios of costs and recovery targets. First, we consider scenarios A0 and A100
with the same 108 large instances of [33] and recovery targets of 0 and 100%, respectively.
The case of 0% is to evaluate the effectiveness of the heuristic for the traditional ELSR, i.e. the
problem without recovery targets. The case of 100% is for evaluating the performance of the
heuristic assuming full remanufacturing, i.e. all the returns must be remanufactured. This may
be convenient under the assumptions of returns at low costs and not sufficient to meet the
demand requirements, as it happens for most of the instances of [33]. Secondly, we consider
four scenarios of high-cost remanufacturing by means of the instances of [33] but set-up costs

45

cases in which remanufacturing is driven by legislations or market pressures rather than the
economic opportunities. This may be also the case for environment-friendly companies. In
total, we consider 640 large instances of the ELSR-RT organized in 6 different scenarios of 108
instances of 52 periods.
The heuristic was coded in Java and executed in a Java Runtime Environment 1.8.0_25 on
HP laptop with Intel(R) Core i5–42,010 CPU, 8 GB of RAM, and operating system Windows
8.1 of 64 bits. MILP (1)–(8) was coded in AMPL and solved for each instance with solver
CPLEX 12.3.6.0 in a PC with Intel(R) Core i7 5960X 3,50GHz with 16 CPUs, 64 GB of
RAM and operating system CentOS 7. Note that the computing environment used for the
heuristic is significantly less powerful of that for CPLEX. Tables 1, 2 and 3 provide the general
results of the numerical experiment and Tables 4, 5 and 6 the results for distinct levels of set-up
and holding inventory costs. We note that for scenarios type B the costs for remanufacturing
and holding returns are both constant for all the instances. The percentage of cost error in
Tables 1, 2, 4, 5 and 6 was calculated as 100 × (h − c)/c with h the cost of the solution returned
by the heuristic variant and c the objective value obtained by CPLEX with a running time limit
of 3600 s.
From Tables 1, 2, 4 and 5 we can observe that the heuristic shows a very good performance
for the problem without recovery targets, i.e. ELSR instances. Indeed, the heuristic can reach
the optimal solution for each one of the 108 instances of scenario B0, even with a higher
remanufacturing rate than the optimal solutions determined by CPLEX. We note that for the
ELSR instances of scenarios A0 and B0, both heuristic variants work in the same way since
the criterion for selecting the periods for remanufacturing is the same. Considering those ELSR
instances with zero inventory cost for the returns and equal set-up costs for both production
and remanufacturing, we note that there is always an optimal solution without
remanufacturing, i.e., demand is fully satisified by the prodution of new items. However, for
this kind of instances from scenario B0, the heuristic is able to identify optimal solutions in
which the number of returns is sufficient enough to substitute the production quantity of
certain periods by remanufacturing. On the other hand, under higher remanufacturing costs
(Kr > Kp), the total remanufacturing quantity must be zero in the optimal solutions, and the
heuristic is also able to adapt properly to this situation. Tables 4 and 5 indicate that for changes
in the set-up costs, the behaviour of the heuristic for the ELSR is the same as that observed by
Teunter et al. (2006): the performance gets worse as the production setup cost increases, and
conversely, it improves as the set-up cost decreases. However, the behaviour does not seem to

be influenced by the changes in the inventory cost of the returns, although a slight improvement can be observed as this cost increases.
In the case of positive recovery targets, the performance of the heuristic decreases as the
recovery target increases. In the case of high cost for remanufacturing and recovery target of
50% (scenario B50) both heuristic variants show a very good performance with a cost error
percentage of 2.07% in average. Note that in this case both variants work in the same way too,
because the recovery target is reached in the first iterations and then the search is only guided
by the criterion of improving together the cost and remanufacturing rate. With a recovery target
of 75% (scenario B75) the H-MEP variant outperforms the H-MCP variant, although both
exhibit a good performance with an error cost less than 5% in average. For a recovery target of
100% (scenario B100) we note that the performance of the heuristic is certainly bad. However,
we note that the H-MEP variant also outperforms the H-MCP variant in this case and in
addition H-MEP shows less variation of cost error percentages. Finally, from Tables 5 and 6
we note that in the case of positive recovery targets, the performance of the heuristic improves
as the production setup cost increases. This can be explained in part because the negative effect
of high cost for remanufacturing is smooothed as the production cost increases.
Regarding the remanufacturing rate of the solutions, the behaviour of the heuristic is rather
diverse. For those instances without recovery targets, the remanufacturing rate of the heuristic
is slightly less than CPLEX for instances with low-cost returns (scenario A0) and slightly
greater for those instances with high-cost for remanufacturing (scenario B0). For those

instances with recovery targets of 50 and 75% the remanufacturing rate of the heuristic is quite
similar but always greater than CPLEX.
About the running times, we note that both heuristic variants are very fast, with running
times less than half a second in average, and round a second in the worst case. We also note
that the variations on either the recovery targets and cost values have no significant impact on
the running time of the heuristic.
In general, we can conclude that the heuristic is able to achieve high quality solutions for
the ELSR-RT if the recovery targets is not very high, i.e. from 0 to 75% of the total returns
amount. We also note that in general H-MEP variant outperforms H-MCP. In addition, the
heuristic is able to determine high quality solutions, even optimal ones, with a higher
remanufacturing rate than the solutions obtained by CPLEX. In cases in which a very high
recovery rate is required, i.e. recovery targets near or equal to 100%, the proposed heuristic is
far from getting high quality solutions. However, in these cases, the more-effective-period
criterion for selecting the next period with positive remanufacturing seems to be more
appropriate to achieve the recovery objectives than the criterion of minimum-cost-period.
We can also draw the following managerial insights form the numerical experiment carried
out. First, we note that under low-cost returns (scenarios A0 and A100), the remanufacturing
rate of the optimal solutions may be rather higher than the recovery target set in advance.
Indeed, in the case of zero recovery target, the remanufacturing rate of the optimal solutions is
near to 90%. In addition, in the case that a full remanufacturing is required, i.e. a recovery
target of 100%, we found that the cost increases by less than 6% on average. Thus, we can

conclude that under situations of low-cost returns the recovery target should be set high, i.e.,
greater than 75%. In the case of prohibitive costs for remanufacturing (scenarios type B), as is
to be expected, the remanufacturing rate of the optimal solutions is close to the recovery target
fixed in advance. However, when comparing the CPLEX solutions for each of the 108
instances of scenario B0 against the CPLEX solutions of scenarios B50, B75 and B100
respectively, we find that, on average, the costs of these solutions increase more smoothly
than the remanufacturing rate: 26% for B50, 39% for B75 and 74% for B100. Therefore, even
under situations of prohibitive cost for remanufacturing, it would be possible to determine a
solution that meets a specific level of recovery at a lower cost than expected in advance.

Conclusions
This paper proposes a polynomial-time heuristic procedure for the ELSR-RT, i.e., the ELSR
with recovery targets. The recovery target is stated as a lower bound on the numbers of returns
that must be remanufactured. We show that this problem extension can be formulated as a
generalization of the traditional ELSR, which is a well-known NP-hard problem even under
the cost structure considered here. The heuristic is based on determining the most suitable
periods for remanufacturing one at a time according to two different criteria: the minimumcost-period or the more-effective-period, that we termed as the H-MCP and H-MEP variants of
the heuristic, respectively. We evaluate the heuristic under different recovery target and cost
settings, by extending a benchmark set of large instances of the literature. For the problem with
zero recovery-target, i.e. the traditional ELSR, the results obtained from the numerical
experiment carried out show the effectiveness of the heuristic: around 2.5% of optimality
gap in less than half of a second of running time in average. In the cases of positive recovery
targets the performance of the heuristic decreases as recovery target values increase. For
medium-range recovery targets, the heuristic is still able to achieve solutions of acceptable
quality, but for recovery targets equal to 100%, the results show that the performance of the
heuristic is very bad. However, we note that for this latter case and in general, the H-MEP
variant of the heuristic outperforms the H-MCP variant. In addition, we note that the solutions
obtained by the heuristic have in most cases a remanufacturing rate higher than the solutions
obtained by CPLEX.

i.e. near to 100% of the returns, appear to be more challenging cases thus requiring more
effective solving methods. Another interesting direction for future research is to consider the
problem of determining the solution of minimum cost and maximum recovery rate, with the
aim of achieving both economic as well as environment goals.
