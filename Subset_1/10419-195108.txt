Introduction
The second half of the twentieth century witnessed the global rise of a consumption-based
economy. This trend resulted in an ever-increasing threat to environmental sustainability. Environmentally conscious manufacturing, waste reduction and product recovery have
emerged as alternative means of coping with this significant societal problem. In this paper,
we focus on supply chains with product recovery, which aim at capturing the remaining
economical value in used, unsold, or obsolete products. Based on a survey of nine case
studies on product recovery processes in different industries, Fleischmann et al. [11] highlight the following common activities: (i) collection of used products, (ii) inspection and
separation of the recoverable returns and those that need to be disposed due to economic
and/or technological reasons, (iii) reprocessing the returns, which involves reuse, recycling,
remanufacturing or repair, and (iv) redistribution of the recovered materials, components or
products. From a logistics viewpoint, these activities create a reverse flow of goods from
consumers toward upstream layers of the supply chain. The simultaneous presence of forward and reverse flows cause unique challenges for supply chain design, which we tackle in
this paper. To this end, we provide an analytical framework for making structural decisions
pertaining to distribution systems with reverse flows.
Under pressure from environmental groups and society at large, governments are
increasingly involved in regulating product recovery, because it can serve as an effective mechanism for sustaining the environment. The WEEE legislation in the European
Union [36] that became effective in February 2014, for example, requires manufacturers to establish environmentally sound recovery processes including remanufacturing for
used electrical and electronic equipment. On the other hand, an increasing number of companies have been implementing comprehensive programs in order to reap the potential
benefits of remanufacturing. According to the United States International Trade Commission report prepared in October 2012 (USITC Publication 4356, [34]), United States was
the world’s largest remanufacturer during the period of 2009-2011 with the total value
of remanufactured products exceeding $43 billion. Furthermore, the most remanufacturing intensive industries in the United States comprise aerospace, electrical and electronic
equipment, locomotives, machinery, medical devices, motor vehicle parts, office furniture,
and retreaded tires. Thanks to HP’s reuse and recycling programs, more than 80% of ink
cartridges and 38% of LaserJet toner cartridges are produced with recycled plastic [14].
Moreover, HP Planet Partners have recycled more than 3.3 billion pounds of products
since 1987. Xerox reports that their combined returns programs including equipment resale
and remanufacturing along with parts and consumable reuse and recycling prevented over
38,000 metric tons of waste in 2003 which otherwise would end up in landfills [37].
Managing the flow of returned products from customer zones to remanufacturing facilities often involves the establishment and operation of return centers. A return center
typically offers scale economies in dealing with returned products in much the same way
a distribution center plays a role in the distribution networks. It is well understood that the

facilities whereas the rest are either sent to recycling facilities or to landfill and incineration
sites for disposal.
A significant majority of the research on the design of reverse logistics (RL) networks
has focused on the structural decisions regarding the reverse distribution networks. The
location and sizing decisions associated with only the collection, inspection, recycling and
remanufacturing facilities are incorporated in the proposed mathematical formulations. A
recent and comprehensive review on these papers, which do not incorporate the configurational decisions pertaining to the forward distribution network, can be found in [1, 13].
There are 31 papers that are immediately relevant to our research since they incorporate the
flows in both directions in making design decisions. We discuss this stream of research in
more detail in the next section.
This paper’s main contribution is a methodology for designing closed-loop supply chains
(CLSCs) i.e., making structural decisions pertaining to both the forward and reverse distribution networks simultaneously. To this end, we incorporate the presence of reverse
flows, return centers and remanufacturing facilities in the well-known (single-commodity)
production-distribution system design model. Using our modeling framework, we address
two important strategic questions. “Is there a significant benefit due to designing forward
and reverse networks simultaneously rather than sequentially?” and “Under which conditions can the return centers be co-located with remanufacturing facilities rather than being
established at the downstream echelons of the supply chain?” Through extensive computational experiments, we find that the general level of capacity utilization in remanufacturing
facilities is a key factor determining the potential benefits of the integrated design approach.
We also observe that the most appropriate echelon for return centers that perform inspection
and separation heavily depends on the overall quality and quantity of the returns collected
at the customer zones. On the algorithmic front, we study the effectiveness of Lagrangian
relaxation in solving the CLSC design models presented in the paper. Our computational
experiments indicate that the Lagrangian relaxation is more efficient than CPLEX for
large-scale problem instances.
The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. An overview of the most relevant literature is provided in the next section. “The basic model” presents the integrated model for
designing distribution systems with reverse flows and “Solution methodology” outlines the
Lagrangian heuristic for this problem. In “Computational experiments”, we implement the
heuristic in solving a realistic case study and demonstrate its computational efficiency for
large-scale problem instances. “Integrated versus sequential design” is devoted to the comparison of alternative approaches to CLSC design in order to demonstrate the advantages of
the proposed integrated approach. “Where to locate the return centers?” extends the basic
model to determine whether the firm can benefit from establishing the return centers at the
upstream echelon co-located with the remanufacturing facilities. We finish the paper with
some concluding remarks.

Detailed overview of the literature
The design of a CLSC is in fact related to the notion of supply chain integration (SCI). SCI
represents the level at which a producer works together with its partners in the supply chain
to generate an effective and efficient flow of products, information, services and value to

latter one involves considering the integration of problems at different decision levels. For
example, tackling the supplier selection problem together with the network design problem
is horizontal integration since both problems occur at the strategic level. Addressing network
design problem while taking into account vehicle routing issues for a distribution company
can be seen as vertical integration. In our setting, the design of CLSC where configurational
decisions concerning both forward and reverse networks are involved is clearly horizontal
integration because the corresponding decisions are all pertinent to the strategic level.
In this section, we focus on 31 papers that are immediately relevant to our work due to
their focus on the design of distribution systems with reverse flows by incorporating facility location decisions. These papers are given in Table 1 and categorized with regard to
the network structure modeled, i.e., whether the designed network includes return centers
(RC), remanufacturing facilities (RmF), manufacturing plants (P) and/or distribution centers
(DC). We would like to emphasize that facility types called collection centers and inspection centers in some studies are treated under the name “RC”. In Table 1, we also indicate
what type of uncertainty is taken into account in the model, the solution approach/algorithm
adopted, and whether the proposed methodology is implemented in a real-life case.
In an early effort, Mar´n and Pelegrin [22] extended the simple plant location problem to
ı
define the return plant location problem where each manufacturing plant to be established
also serves as a collection center for customer returns. A more realistic extension of this very
basic network is considered in Beamon and Fernandes [5] where the manufacturing plants
serve the customer demand via warehouses and receive the returns via collection centers
and warehouses. Fleischmann et al. [12] compare the sequential and integrated approaches
for the design decisions and by analyzing two hypothetical examples inspired by real-life
industrial cases the authors conclude that the reverse flows have a significant impact on the
overall network structure only when the forward and reverse channels differ in a considerable way with respect to geographical distribution or cost structure. The authors also point
out that return volumes constitute a key factor in the design decisions.
Salema et al. [29] offer an alternative formulation where the flow variables are represented at two levels (i.e., plant-warehouse and warehouse-customer) rather than the
single level formulation of flow variables in Fleischmann et al. [12] (i.e., plant-warehousecustomer). In solving two cases, based on a document-office company in Spain and copier
remanufacturing in Europe, the authors used the CPLEX solver within GAMS Suite. An
extended model is also provided for the capacitated and multi-product version of the design
problem, which was implemented for only two products during the case analysis. Salema
et al. [31] is an effort to incorporate tactical decisions, such as production and inventory levels, in the integrated RL network design. Extending their earlier formulation to represent a
set of macro and micro time periods, Salema et al. [31] demonstrate that the arising model
can handle fairly large problem instances encountered in practice. Later on, Salema et al.
[32] build upon their previous work and propose a generalized model that yields a tactical
plan for acquisition, production, storage and distribution in a predefined time horizon in
addition to designing the supply chain considering simultaneously the forward and reverse
flows.
In perhaps the most detailed case study for integrated RL network design, Krikke
et al. [17] focus on the forward and reverse supply chains of refrigerators and evaluate three

centers. The authors develop a multi-period model to determine the opening, expansion, and
closing decisions of the warehouses and repair centers over time. Lu and Bostel [21] provide
an mixed-integer linear (MILP) formulation where the customer zones are directly served
from manufacturing or remanufacturing facilities, whereas reverse flows go through intermediate centers (that perform cleaning, disassembly, testing and sorting) on their way to the
remanufacturing facilities. The MILP model formulated by Sahyouni et al. [28] extends the
model of [22] in the sense that hybrid facilities are established to be utilized in both forward
and reverse logistics operations. Lagrangian relaxation is used to solve the developed model.

reverse channels. Their objective is to determine the locations of the collection centers and
remanufacturing facilities along with the forward and reverse flows such that the sum of the
¨
processing, transportation, and facility location costs are minimized. Easwaran and Uster
[10] incorporate capacitated Hybrid Centers (HCs) and Hybrid Sourcing Facilities (HSFs)
into their existing models. HCs can play the role of both DCs and/or RCs and HSFs perform
both manufacturing of new products and remanufacturing of used products. The aim of the
developed model is to determine the best locations of the HSFs and the HCs as well as the
best flow of products in the CLSC network.
Zhou and Wang [40] present a very similar model to that of Fleischmann et al. [12] in
which returns can be repaired at centralized return centers and sent back to the warehouses
to satisfy the customer demand. Lee and Dong [18] develop a Tabu search based heuristic for integrated RL network design in end-of-lease computers. In their model, there is a
single OEM who wants to establish a set of capacitated hybrid processing facilities that
serve as both DCs as well as collection centers. The same authors deal with a multi-period
location and allocation model where optimal locations for forward processing facilities, collection centers, and hybrid processing are sought under demand and return uncertainty [19].
The solution approach adopted is based on sample average approximation method combined with a simulated annealing heuristic. Pishvaee et al. [25] investigate an integrated
forward/reverse logistics network design problem in which the production/recovery centers,
distribution/collection centers, and disposal centers are considered while taking into account
the uncertainties about the demand, number of returns and variable costs. Pishvaee et al.
[26] examine the effect of the capacity levels on logistics network efficiency and responsiveness by formulating a multi-objective, multi-stage forward/reverse logistics network
design including production, distribution, collection/inspection, recovery and disposal facilities with multiple capacity levels. Wang and Hsu [38] propose a CLSC network including
recovery and landfilling rates to integrate environmental issues into a traditional logistics
system.
Zhang et al. [39] address a dynamic capacitated production planning problem in a steel
¨
company by means of a multi-echelon, multi-period and multi-product CLSC model. Ozkır
and Baslıgil [23] incorporate material recovery, component recovery and product recovery
¸
processes into design of a CLSC network to increase system profitability. Keyvanshokooh
et al. [15] study a multi-echelon, multi-period, multi-commodity and capacitated integrated
forward/reverse logistics network concerning the quality levels of the returned products and
acquisition price offered according to return type. The paper by Rosa et al. [27] proposes
a multi-period CLSC network model by allowing the locations of plants, DCs and RCs
to be changed. The capacities of all the facilities can also be modified (i.e., increased or
decreased) during the planning horizon. The deterministic model is then extended to a robust
optimization model by taking into account the uncertainty in demand and return. Amin and
Zhang [3] first formulate a deterministic MILP model where plants and collection centers
are opened and then extend it to a stochastic bi-objective model with demand and return
uncertainty. As the solution approach, they apply -constraint method and weighted sums
method.
Demirel et al. [9] examine a multi-period and multi-part MILP model for a capacitated
CLSC network under deterministic demand. They contribute to the literature by incorporating second-hand sales, incremental incentives and inventory policies in the return
streams of the CLCS network as well as the trade-offs between virgin parts and used

studies on CLSC network design and focus on the following two questions: How do the
uncertainties in market size, return quantities and recovery rate affect the profitability of
the CLSC and how is product recovery strategy influenced by the consumer perception
of remanufactured products and variable cost structure. To this end, the authors develop a
stochastic mixed-integer quadratic model use a solution approach based on an integration
of the integer L-shaped decomposition with sample average approximation which enables
to handle many scenarios.
Shi et al. [33] develop a multi-objective an MILP model for a CLSC network design
problem. In addition to the overall costs, the model optimizes overall carbon emissions and
the responsiveness of the network. An improved genetic algorithm based on the framework
of nondominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA II) is developed to obtain Pareto-optimal
solutions. In their paper, Pedram et al. [24] examine a CLSC model for tire industry with
demand and return uncertainty where both forward and reverse chain consists of three layers. In particular, collection centers, retreading centers and recycling centers constitute the
facilities in the reverse channel. Amin and Baki [2] propose a bi-objective CLSC model
in which one objective is on-time delivery maximization from the suppliers and the other
objective is profit maximization. There exists uncertainty in the demand and factors such as
exchange rates and customs duties are also taken into account which differentiates this study
from other works. Moreover, a case study is presented involving electrical and electronic
equipments.
As can be seen, the first research question we pose is partially examined by Fleischmann
et al. [12] where two different real CLSCs are compared and it is shown that integrated
design may be beneficial depending on the difference between forward and reverse channels. However, there is no systematic analysis regarding the amount of the resulting benefit
based on the relevant parameters. Our paper is an attempt towards filling this gap. The sec¨
ond research question we investigate is somehow covered in Easwaran and Uster [10]. But,
in that paper DCs are necessarily co-located with RCs, which means that once an RC is colocated with a remanufacturing facility, there is also a DC established there. We believe that
this is rather a restrictive assumption. Therefore, in our paper, we look at the co-location
issue only in terms of the facilities handling reverse flows, i.e., remanufacturing facilities
and RCs.

The basic model
In this section, we present a basic model that incorporates reverse flows as well as the associated RCs in the distribution network design problem. Based on a set of existing plants
(each with given manufacturing and remanufacturing capacities) and a set of customer zones
(each with given demand and return quantities for a single product), the model determines
the optimal number and location of the DCs and RCs so as to minimize the total cost of
establishing and operating this closed-loop network. The model requires that all the demand
is met and all the returns are collected at the customer zones. Therefore, the total number
of manufactured and remanufactured products must be sufficient to satisfy the demand at
the customer zones and the total remanufacturing capacity must be large enough to process
all the remanufacturable returns. We assume no capacity limit for the DCs and RCs to be

Jnl Remanufactur (2017) 7:113–137

These costs can be omitted from the model since the total quantities to be manufactured and
remanufactured are pre-determined. The basic model is extended in the sequel to also
incorporate the location decisions pertaining to the establishment of remanufacturing
facilities.

The objective function includes the transportation cost of both forward and reverse flows
and the fixed cost of opening DCs and RCs. Constraints (1) ensure that the demand of
each customer is satisfied, whereas constraints (2) impose that all the returns are collected.
Due to the existing manufacturing and remanufacturing capacities, single-sourcing of each
customer by a DC and/or an RC cannot be expected. Constraints (3) and (4) are the flow
conservation equations at DCs and RCs, respectively. Note that the amount of returns to be
shipped from an RC to the plants is only a fraction of the returns arriving at the RC, denoted
by α, and the remainder of the returns are to be disposed of. Since this recovery ratio is
a proxy for the overall quality of returns, α does not vary with the RC location. Thus, the
total amount of disposals is pre-determined and by assuming that the unit disposal costs are
the same at all RCs we leave disposal costs out of the model. Constraints (5) ensure that
the number of manufactured products is bounded by the manufacturing capacity, whereas
constraints (7) guarantee that remanufacturing capacity is not exceeded at each plant. In
order to sustain the closed-loop nature of the network, each plant needs to remanufacture
all the incoming returns and ship them off to the DCs as part of the forward flows. Since
remanufacturing is cheaper than manufacturing on the average, each plant will naturally
prioritize processing the returns from RCs. Nonetheless, lower transportation costs between

Jnl Remanufactur (2017) 7:113–137

open DCs and open RCs, respectively. Constraints (10) and (11) are the nonnegativity and
integrality constraints, respectively.
Note that our model allows the possibility of co-locating a DC and an RC at the same
candidate site j . This happens when Yj = Tj = 1, and the opening costs of both types of
center is added up. In other words, we implicity assume that in case a center serves as both a
DC and an RC, no cost benefit can be realized. However, the model can easily be modified to
reflect this situation. Another remark is the addition of constraints (12) to the model, which
are obtained by adding constraints (5) and (7). Although redundant from the viewpoint of
model formulation, constraints (12) tighten the lower bounds (LB) of the subproblems that
arise due to Lagrangian relaxation of P .

Solution methodology
In this section, we present a Lagrangian heuristic (LH) to solve the proposed CLSC network
design model.

Lagrangian heuristic
LH involves relaxing constraints (1), (2), (3), (4), (5) and (6) with multipliers λk , θk , μj ,
πj , γi , and βi , respectively. Naturally, γi and βi are required to be nonnegative. After the
rearrangement of the terms, we obtain the relaxed problem RP as follows:

subject to (7)–(12).
Problem RP can be decomposed into the following four subproblems where each subproblem represents the flow between two consecutive echelons in either the forward or the
reverse network.

It is important that constraints (12) ensure finite values for variables Uij in subproblem RP2 .
In the absence of (12), the Uij values and hence RP2 will be unbounded.

All the four subproblems can be solved by inspection as shown in Appendix 1, and the
objective value of the relaxed problem provides a lower bound on the optimal objective
value ZP of the original problem P for any multiplier vectors λ, θ , μ, π , γ , and β. To find
the best lower bound, we have to solve the Lagrangian dual:

We use subgradient optimization in updating the multipliers at each iteration of the algorithm, which terminates after t0 iterations or a pre-specified CPU time. A formal statement
of the Lagrangian heuristic is provided in Appendix 2. The solutions to RP1 and RP3 prescribe a set of open DCs and a set of open RCs. By fixing the binary variables to represent
these open DCs and RCs, a feasible solution for problem P can be found by solving a simple
transshipment problem. If the binary location variables for distribution centers and return
centers (i.e., variables Yj and Tj ) are set to known values as a result of solving subproblems RP1 and RP3, then the MILP problem P reduces to linear programming problem with
continuous decision variables representing the amount of flow between plants and DCs as
well as DCs and customer zones in the forward network, and between customer zones and
RCs as well as RCs and plants in the reverse network. Since it is a linear program, it can

be easily solved using commercial solver CPLEX. The objective value of this solution ZP B
provides an upper bound (UB) on the optimal objective value of P.

A realistic case study
We study the performance of LH in solving a realistic case study that is based on the copier
remanufacturing case in Fleischmann et al. [12]. The original case models 50 European
cities with a population of over 500,000 as customer zones. In an effort to use up-to-date
population data, we searched wikipedia.org and nationsonline.org and identified 63 European cities with more than 500,000 inhabitants, 27 of which are the national
capitals. We assume that there is a plant at each of the 27 capitals, and the 63 major cities
constitute the set of alternative sites for the DCs and RCs to be established. Consequently,
our case is an I27,63,63 instance of the network design problem.
The model parameters were set to the values in Fleischmann et al. [12]. The fixed costs of
establishing DCs and RCs are fj =1,500,000 and gj = 500,000 Euros. The unit transport
costs per kilometer are cij = 0.0045, ej k = 0.01, cj i = 0.005 and ekj = 0.003 Euro. The
demand per 1,000 inhabitants is 10 units (i.e., dk = population /100), whereas the return and
recovery ratios are τ = 0.6 and α = 0.5, respectively. Since there is no capacity information
in the original case, we experimented with three capacity levels for the manufacturing and
remanufacturing facilities at each plant. Let n denote the number of plants. We compute the
three alternative capacity levels using the formulae below:

ai =

a ατ

k dk

n

and si =

s

k dk

− nai

(13)

n

where the capacity parameters (a , s ) take the values (1.5, 1.2), (3.0, 2.4), and (4.5, 3.6)
for low, medium, and high capacity levels, respectively.
Table 2 compares the performance of LH with that of CPLEX. The percent deviation
from the optimal objective value z is denoted by “%” and it is calculated as 100 × (U B −
z)/z. We observe that the problem instance becomes more difficult to solve as the manufacturing and remanufacturing capacities are reduced. For the most challenging instance,
which has the lowest capacity levels, LH provides a solution that is within 6.1 percent of
the optimal solution obtained by CPLEX, albeit it requires about twice the computation
time. Perhaps more importantly, CPLEX requires almost triple the time to solve the low
capacity instance compared to that of the high capacity instance, whereas the computational
requirement increases only 27% for the proposed algorithm.
By studying the optimal sets of DC and RC locations, we conclude that the model is not
robust with respect to the manufacturing and remanufacturing capacity levels. It is optimal

to establish three DCs and co-locate the RCs with these facilities for all capacity levels.
Two out of three sites are common for the low and medium capacities, whereas a set of
completely different cities is used for the high capacity levels. We also find that the model
is not robust with respect to the solution quality. While LH provides solutions between
2% and 6.1% of the optimal objective value as the capacity levels are varied, none of the
sites in the heuristic solution are the same as those in the optimal solution of the same
instance. We also solved the case with lower return and recovery ratios i.e., τ = 0.3 and
α = 0.2, respectively. The optimal solution in this case is to open a single RC at the same
location regardless of the capacity levels (of course, the optimal DC sites do not change).
Interestingly, this dominant single RC site is not included in any of the three solutions for
the original τ = 0.6 and α = 0.5 instance. This implies that a greedy heuristic may not
work well for this closed-loop supply chain design problem.
This I27,63,63 problem can be considered as a medium-scale instance, and we demonstrate
the performance of the proposed Lagrangian relaxation procedure in solving large-scale
instances in the next section.

Solving large-scale problem instances
We generate 24 problem instances by fixing the number of plants at 20 and setting the number of customer zones to 100, 200, 400, and 800. Since each customer zone is considered
as an alternative DC/RC site, we in fact can group these 24 instances in four sets which we
call I20,100,100 , I20,200,200 , and I20,400,400 in the sequel. The (x, y) coordinates for the plants,
potential DC/RC sites and customer zones in each set are generated through uniformly distributed random numbers in [0, 1]. The unit transportation costs are estimated using the
Euclidean distance between the facility pairs in consecutive echelons. Therefore, the unit
costs of forward and reverse flows are equal for a given pair of sites. For example, the unit
cost of shipping goods from plant 1 to a DC at site 2 (c12 ) is the same as the unit cost of
transporting returned products from an RC at site 2 to plant 1 (c21 ). The demand at each
customer zone is generated from a uniform distribution between 50 and 100 units. For the
ease of exposition we assume that the return ratio τ = rk /dk is the same for all k. For each
set, we compute three manufacturing and remanufacturing capacity levels using (13) and
use two levels for the fixed costs of establishing DCs and RCs. These are set at $50 and $75,
respectively as the low level and $500 and $750, respectively as the high level. The return
ratio and the recovery ratio are taken as τ = 0.5 and α = 0.5, respectively. The Lagrangian
heuristic has been coded in Matlab 7.4.0 R2007a and the computational experiments were
run on a computer with Intel Xeon CPU X5460 at 3.16 GHz processor and 16 GB of RAM.
We set a 7,200 seconds time limit for CPLEX.
Table 3 reports on our computational results of the closed-loop supply chain design problem. Four instances could not be solved to optimality within the allowed CPU time. For
these more challenging instances, the best solutions identified by CPLEX are reported in
the table (each indicated by “∗”).
Table 3 confirms our earlier observation that problem complexity increases as the capacity levels are reduced. In addition, we found out that problem instances with higher fixed
costs are more difficult than their counterparts with lower fixed costs. Accordingly, CPLEX

LH performs better than CPLEX for the three “high fixed cost” instances of the largest
scale problems we have solved (indicated by the negative % values in Table 3). Notably,
the solutions provided by the proposed Lagrangian heuristic for two I20,400,400 instances are
29–30% better than the best solution identified by CPLEX and these heuristic solutions are
obtained by spending much less computational time.

Integrated versus sequential design
In the previous sections we studied an integrated design approach, which involves simultaneous decisions regarding the location of DCs and RCs as well as forward and reverse
flows in the closed-loop supply chain. An alternative to our approach is sequential design,
which involves first making the DC location and forward flow decisions without incorporating the reverse flows, and then configuring the reverse supply chain by taking the forward
chain structure as given [12]. This is particularly relevant for the firms with an existing forward supply chain and considering the launch of product recovery initiatives. In this section,
we compare these two approaches in an effort to highlight the potential benefits of integrated design. We address the following question: “Is there a significant difference between

In comparing the integrated and sequential design approaches, we first study the impact of
the quantity and quality of the returns. Note that the return ratio τ at the customer zones
is a measure of return quantity, whereas the recovery ratio α at the RCs is a proxy for
return quality. For the ease of studying the solutions in detail and tracking the changes
during the parametric analysis, we use a randomly generated I5,10,20 instance with fixed
costs (fj , gj ) = (50, 50). The total demand k dk = 1455 for this instance, and hence
the total amount of reverse flows into the plants is 1455ατ . Although the other 15 I5,10,20
instances we have solved are not discussed here in the interest of space, we remark that the
observed patterns are similar.
We set recovery ratio α = 0.6, manufacturing capacity si = 300, and remanufacturing
capacity ai = 200 for all plants, while varying the return ratio τ in the range (0, 1] with
increments of 0.1. Table 4 depicts the (optimal) total costs for integrated and sequential
design as well as the associated forward and reverse cost components. The last column indicates
the percent cost savings that can be achieved by integrated design under each scenario.

In the sequential approach, the optimal objective value of the forward problem does not
vary with the return ratio τ because reverse flows are not incorporated in PF . The reverse
logistics costs, however, increase with τ in both approaches since more returns need to be
shipped back from customer zones. More importantly, the optimal reverse costs in the two
approaches are the same in Table 4, whereas the optimal forward cost of the integrated
design is always lower than that of the sequential design. That is, the cost disadvantage of
the sequential design approach is due to the forward network (i.e., DC locations and forward
flows) rather than the reverse network (i.e., RC locations and reverse flows). The open DCs
and RCs in both designs are depicted in Table 5. Note that the integrated design has the
ability to adapt the forward network configuration according to the return ratio.
We now focus on the costs related to forward flows. In Table 4, the optimal forward cost
first decreases and then increases with respect to the return ratio τ . This can be explained
in terms of the overall level of remanufacturing capacity utilization. Clearly, remanufacturing capacity is under-utilized for low values of τ . For example, when τ = 0.2 only
174 units need to be remanufactured which amounts to 17.5 percent utilization of the overall remanufacturing capacity (given that α = 0.6, ai = 200 and there are five plants
in this instance). Therefore, as τ increases, the additional returns can be sent to those
remanufacturing facilities that are in the plants with smaller forward costs. Thus, the remanufacturing capacity at such plants provides additional capability to serve the customer
demand through cheaper forward channels (e.g., plant-DC combinations) and to reduce the
forward costs. When these remanufacturing facilities are fully utilized, however, further
increases of τ make the use of expensive forward channels inevitable (in Table 4 when
τ > 0.7). The forward cost curve behaves similarly for other values of α as shown in
Fig. 2. For α = 0.2 and 0.4 the forward cost curves are nonincreasing since the remanufacturing capacity remains significantly under-utilized as the return ratio increases. Also,
for α = 0.8 there is no feasible solution to the integrated problem when τ > 0.9. This
is because the total remanufacturing capacity is insufficient to process all the recoverable
returns (i.e., 1455 × 0.8 × 0.9 = 1048 > 1000 = 5 × 200). In Fig. 3, the forward cost is
depicted as a function of the recovery ratio α for fixed values of the return ratio τ. Note that
the forward cost curves in Figs. 2 and 3 demonstrate the same patterns. This is expected
since it is the product of the return ratio and the recovery ratio that determines the number of
items to be remanufactured and consequently the overall utilization of the remanufacturing
capacity.
Based on the above observations, we shift our focus on the effect of manufacturing capacity si and remanufacturing capacity ai on the percent cost difference between the integrated
and sequential design approaches. For this set of experiments, we fix τ = 0.5 and α = 0.6

129

Fig. 2 Forward cost of the integrated design for varying return ratios

We vary the remanufacturing capacity ai while manufacturing capacity is fixed at
si = 300. The optimal costs provided by the two design approaches as well as the percent
cost differences are depicted in Table 6. At ai = 90, the total remanufacturing capacity of
450 is still sufficient to process all the 437 recoverable returns (i.e., 1455×0.5×0.6). Consistent with our earlier observations, the increase in remanufacturing capacity has no impact
on the total forward cost in sequential design and the total reverse costs are the same for
both approaches. The reverse costs decrease as remanufacturing capacity increases since
the cheaper reverse channels (e.g., RC-plant combinations) can be used for a larger portion
of the recoverable returns. More importantly, Table 6 confirms our earlier findings regarding the impact of remanufacturing capacity utilization on the forward costs of integrated
design. Increasing ai reduces the overall utilization level, which enables increased use of
the remanufacturing facilities at plants with smaller forward costs.
Our computational experiments on the same problem instance to study the impact of
varying the manufacturing capacity si are summarized in Table 7. We observe that for
a given value of the remanufacturing capacity ai the cost savings obtained by integrated
design decrease as the manufacturing capacity increases. Although increasing manufacturing capacity enables the use of cheaper plant-DC combinations in both integrated and
sequential design, the forward costs decrease faster in the latter case. This can be attributed

deciding the forward network structure. Again, the reverse costs are the same for both design
approaches.
During the computational experiments, we observed that optimal configuration and cost
of the reverse network seem to be robust with respect to the design approach. Note that the
same sets of RCs are opened by both integrated and sequential approaches under all τ , α and
capacity values in Tables 4–7. Parametric analysis on the other I5,10,20 instances we studied
by varying τ values confirm this observation.

Where to locate the return centers?
The preceding discussion assumes that the firm has a policy of locating RCs in the second echelon. An alternative strategy would be to co-locate the RCs with remanufacturing
facilities in the first echelon. This option has the fixed cost advantage due to the possible
scale economies associated with co-location. These savings, however, may be offset by the

increased transportation costs since the unrecoverable returns are no longer disposed of at
the second echelon. In this section, we address the question “Under which conditions would
the integration of inspection and remanufacturing operations be beneficial?”
In order to compare the two policies mentioned above, we extend our original model
(which assumes remanufacturing capability at all plants) so as to identify the optimal locations for remanufacturing. This can easily be incorporated in Problem P by defining a new
binary variable Hi which takes the value one if a remanufacturing facility is located at plant
i and zero otherwise. We also let hi denote the fixed cost of opening a remanufacturing facility at plant i. The resulting downstream problem PD represents the policy of locating RCs in
the second echelon. To capture the decisions pertaining to the establishment of remanufacturing capacity at the existing plants, constraints (7) need to be modified as (7 ) . Problem
PD can be solved via the Lagrangian heuristic presented in “Solution methodology”.

In formulating the upstream problem PU we assume that the returns are sent from customer zones to the RCs at the remanufacturing facilities through the DCs. This is a plausible
assumption in many cases since the firms often use the same vehicles to deliver customer
orders and collect returns. As a result, the DCs serve as consolidation centers for returns
from different customer zones. We define a new variable Li = 1 if an RC and a remanufacturing facility is co-located at plant i and zero otherwise. The fixed cost of this integrated
facility is represented by li . The following formulation of the upstream problem PU also
reflects that the unrecoverable returns are disposed of at the first echelon.

In the computational experiments we use the same I5,10,20 instance with the following
parameter values: si = 300, ai = 200, fj , gj , hi = (50, 75, 100). We calculate the optimal cost of the upstream and downstream models for return ratio τ and recovery ratio α in
the range (0, 1] with increments of 0.2 and li ∈ {125, 150, 175}. Table 8 shows the results
in terms of the percent cost difference with respect to the downstream model. That is, the

We observe that when there is no fixed cost advantage (i.e., li = gj + hi = 175), the
downstream location of RCs is always better because PD involves less transportation costs
due to the early disposal of unrecoverable returns. Naturally, the upstream model exhibits
better performance as the fixed cost advantage increases, particularly when li = 125. In
general, higher values of the recovery ratio α and lower values of the return ratio τ favor the
upstream model since the number of unrecoverable returns is smaller in such cases. Note
that for fixed α higher values of τ mean more returns that need to be disposed of. This is
why the downstream location of RCs is still preferable for α = 0.2 and τ = 0.8 or 1.0 when
li = 125. Based on these observations, we conclude that for any combination of α and τ ,
the choice between downstream and upstream location policies depends on the fixed cost
advantage associated with co-locating an RC and a remanufacturing facility. The impact of
increasing return ratio and recovery ratio parameters on the location policy of RCs, however,
is complicated by the presence of remanufacturing capacity. The critical issue is whether the
reverse system needs additional RCs to accommodate the increase in the number of returns.
The discrete nature of these decisions prevents us from observing a clear trend in terms of
locating the RCs in the second echelon or together with the remanufacturing facilities in the
first echelon. The conclusions drawn from the experiments on this I5,10,20 remain valid for
the other instances we have studied.

reverse networks simultaneously. This enables the firm to take into account the remanufactured items at its plants when planning the shipments to the distribution centers. Our
computational experiments show that the proposed Lagrangian relaxation procedure is
efficient in solving problems of the size encountered by managers. The quality of the
solutions provided by the algorithm is particularly encouraging.
In comparing our integrated approach with the sequential approach for designing distribution networks with reverse flows, we found out that the cost advantages of the former
can reach 10 percent. Interestingly, the reverse network structure seems to be robust to the
design approach and the cost difference is mainly due to the forward network configuration. This suggests that the ability of the forward network to adapt itself to the presence
of reverse flows is the main advantage of the integrated design approach. In the event that
the firm already has an established forward network, the integrated solution can serve as a
target configuration for the existing distribution centers to converge in the long run.
The level of remanufacturing capacity utilization turns out to be a key determinant of the
potential benefits that can be achieved via the integrated approach. This relates to the ability
of the firm to ship the recoverable returns to the remanufacturing facilities at the plants with
cheaper distribution center connections. During our computational experiments, we consistently observed that the benefits of the integrated model first increase and then decrease as
the return ratio increases. For high values of the return ratio, the cost difference between
the integrated and sequential approaches is minimal. Note that this confirms the findings of
Fleischmann et al. [12] since the forward and reverse network structures become similar as
the return ratio approaches to one. While [12] explain the potential benefits of the integrated
approach mainly on the basis of cost structures, however, our analysis highlights the difference between the degrees of freedom in designing the forward and reverse networks (the
latter being much smaller because the number of facilities is typically less) as another significant factor. The integrated approach is most beneficial for medium values of the return
ratio. We also observed that the firm can benefit from the scope economies associated with
conducting the inspection and separation operations at the upstream echelon as the overall
quality of the returns at the customer zones increases.
