1 Background
Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning System (LEAP) is a widely used software tool
for energy policy analysis and climate change mitigation assessment developed by the
Stockholm Environment Institute. According to Heaps (2008), LEAP is a standard tool
that enables countries to contact integrated resource planning, greenhouse gases
(GHG), mitigation assessments, and low-emission development strategies (LEDS).
Furthermore, several countries have been based on LEAP’s output in order to report to
the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).
There are various studies in Greece that have been conducted in order to provide
the literature with long-term projections in the energy sector using LEAP (among
others, Papagiannis et al. 2008; Giatrakos et al. 2009; Roinioti et al. 2012). According
to Bhattacharyya and Timilsina (2010), LEAP is based on the accounting framework in
order to generate energy demand (and supply) and on the physical description of the

examined energy system. Furthermore, on their extensive review Bhattacharyya and
Timilsina (2010) emphasize the fact that LEAP is based on the scenario approach in
order for several paths of energy system evolution to be developed. According to Heaps
(2002), the forecast of the energy demand is based on the effect of alternative market
shares, whereas the supply side is based on a what-if analysis and possible development
scenarios which LEAP integrates through simulation and accounting approaches.
Our paper constructs four different scenarios for the period 1990–2030 in order to
evaluate the demand of Greek energy derived from renewable energy sources (RES)
and the GHG emissions generated over the same period for the sectors of industry,
transport, and energy. Therefore, in the first stage, the paper forecasts the energy demand derived from renewable sources alongside the generated GHG emissions (under
the four scenarios). Furthermore, in the second stage analysis, it applies a nonparametric estimator based on the mathematical approach known as data envelopment
analysis (DEA)1 in order to evaluate the efficiency of the Greek renewable energy policies imposed under the Law L3851/2010 which was introduced in order to comply
with the European targets set in 2007 and in 2014.2 As a result, the paper presents a
way for evaluating the efficiency of the future implementation of renewable energy
policies, which in our case have been set by the Greek government and under four
different energy-based scenarios.
The article is constructed as follows. Section 2 presents a review of the relative literature,
the four scenarios for the Greek energy sector and the nonparametric methodology adopted.
Section 3 presents the empirical findings, whereas, the last section concludes the paper.

2 Methods
2.1 A Brief review of LEAP-based studies

The mitigation of greenhouse gases has received much attention since the ratification of
Kyoto Protocol in 1992 at the United Nations Rio Earth Summit. The fulfillment of this
target requires a shift toward cleaner energy, renewable energy sources, energy efficiency,
and low-carbon options. The construction and examination of alternative scenarios is
important for the decision maker (countries, international parties, ministries, etc.) in
order to decide the best path to follow. Long-range Energy Alternatives Planning System
software is an excellent and widely used tool for scenario analysis. LEAP has been widely
used in various sectors such as energy and electricity, industry, and transport.
Bala (1997) used LEAP to investigate the rural energy system of Bangladesh which is
based primarily on biomass. The author argued against massive deforestation as a solution to the energy problem. Islas et al. (2003) examined the Mexican energy sector.
They constructed scenarios for alternative energy sources such as natural gas and RES
and found that in most cases, alternative scenarios are better than the oil-based baseline scenario. Ghanadan and Koomey (2005) constructed four scenarios about the
energy sector in California. The alternative scenarios are based on cleaner energy and
RES, behavioral changes, and energy efficiency changes. Shin et al. (2005) assessed the
use of landfill gas as a renewable energy source for electricity in Korea. The results are
not clear due to economic, technological, and regulatory uncertainties of landfill gas.
Mulugetta et al (2007) investigated the power sector in Taiwan for the time period
2002–2020. They constructed a business-as-usual and two alternative scenarios about improvements in efficiency and introduction of RES such as biomass, solar, wind, and
hydropower.
The case of the Chinese electricity sector was investigated by Ζhang et al. (2007).
Alternative policies were examined such as the replacement of coal with nonfossil fuels
and RES and the incorporation of new advanced technology. Cai et al. (2008) studied
five sectors of the Chinese economy (electricity, iron and steel, cement, pulp and paper,
and transport). The results indicated that current mitigation options should be further
encouraged, among others with structure reformation at the sector level, energy efficiency
options, RES, and mitigation incentives. Dagher and Ruble (2011) constructed scenarios
about the electricity sector in Lebanon and examined the shift toward natural gas in one
scenario and toward RES in another scenario. Yophy et al. (2011) investigated the energy
sector in Taiwan. They constructed scenarios about the mitigation of CO2 emissions using
various assumptions such as enhancing energy efficiency, the closing of existing nuclear
plants, and the possible negative effects from economic growth. Park et al. (2013) examined
the transition of the Korean electricity sector toward RES. The alternative scenarios assume
different levels of environmental policies. The only scenario which yielded reduced
emissions was the sustainability scenario. This scenario assumes that RES would generate
the most electricity by 2050.
Another important cross-national attempt has been made from the European Union
toward the reduction of GHG emissions known as the “20-20-20” targets. According to
these targets, countries are committed to reduce the total EU GHG emission by 20% in
2020 compared to the 1990 levels. The parties are also obliged to raise the share of RES to
20% of the total EU energy consumption and to improve the EU’s energy efficiency by 20%.
The implementation of these ambitious targets has brought scenario analysis into the center
of the scientific community’s attention. The construction of the alternative scenarios and
the results of the analysis are crucial for the decision maker in order to decide which path
will follow toward the fulfillment of the targets.
There are not many LEAP studies for Greece. Giatrakos et al. (2009) investigated the
RES in the power sector at the island of Crete, using a business-as-usual scenario and
two alternative scenarios. The alternatives assume different penetration levels for the
demand-side management policies. The results indicate that the EU targets are achievable
by the end of 2015 without compromising the economic growth of the island. In fact, the
results indicate that the targets could be surpassed, leading to a 30% RES penetration and
50% GHG reduction by 2030. The outcome is a result of wind and photovoltaic parks
which are expected to be constructed at Crete. Karapidakis et al. (2011) have also studied
the power sector in Crete Island toward 2020 using two alternative scenarios. The first
scenario assumes an increase of RES to 20% and a moderate increase in the total installed
capacity wind and photovoltaic plants. The second scenario assumes a significantly larger
increase of RES to 50%, the installation of hydro-pumped storage systems and also a
considerable increase in the total installed capacity of wind and photovoltaic plants.
The results indicated stable emissions for the first scenario and 40% lower emissions
for the second scenario.
Roinioti et al. (2012) examined the Greek energy system with a focus on electricity
production system. The authors used LEAP and created a business-as-usual scenario
and four alternative scenarios based on uncertainties and growth assumptions. Specifically,
the first alternative scenario is the green scenario which assumes low emissions and high growth rate, with the introduction of advanced RES technologies. The orange scenario
assumes high emissions and high growth rate, the red scenario assumes high emissions and
low growth rate, and the blue scenario assumes low emissions and low growth rate.
The results indicated that from an environmental point of view, the best is the green
scenario and the worst is the orange scenario. In addition, green is the only scenario
to achieve the 40% RES target in electricity production by 2020. Ikonomopoulos et al.
(2013) investigated the greenhouse gas emissions in the Greek electricity sector by
2030. The authors created a reference scenario and three alternatives. The reference
scenario assumes that old power stations will close and new RES stations will open
according to the announcements and time schedule of the Ministry of Environment.
The first alternative scenario assumes delays in closing of old thermal stations and
opening new advanced ones. The second alternative scenario assumes the connection
of islands to the mainland grid, and the last scenario assumes the introduction of
hard coal in Greek power generation. The results revealed that all four scenarios
reduce emissions and highlighted the key role of RES.
Apart from the energy and electricity sector, there are a number of studies using
LEAP on the Greek hotel and building sector. Maleviti et al. (2012) studied the energy
consumption in Greek four- and five-star hotels. The authors constructed a businessas-usual scenario and an alternative scenario which assumes the implementation of a
restrictive policy framework toward the reduction of energy consumption, the improvement of energy efficiency, and other improvements. The outcome of this study indicated
the importance of diffusing the information about potential energy improvements to hotel
managers. Katsigiannis et al. (2012) investigated the effects of retrofitting buildings to the
power system of Crete Island which is not connected to the mainland power grid of
Greece. The authors constructed eight alternative scenarios with respect to energy and
electricity consumption and RES penetration emphasizing of RES technologies for the
Greek energy policy.
2.2 A description of the LEAP-based renewable energy policy scenarios3

Scenarios are based on future energy systems which are constructed based on specific
economic condition trends and possibilities (Wiseman et al. 2011; Carter 2007; Moss
et al. 2010). The main concept of LEAP is an end-use driven scenario analysis with a
baseline scenario and different other alternative scenarios. The scenarios are used for a
number of “what if” questions under the arrangement of user-defined assumptions. The
set of conditions is detailed in the scenarios and is constructed in order to encompass
some factors (parameters) that are anticipated to change.
In our case, there are four scenarios generated under different options. The policy
options and the key assumptions the scenarios are based on are presented next.4

2.2.1 Baseline scenario—BASE, BAU

The first scenario is the “Baseline”, which is based on historical trends from 1990 till
2010. Changes in demographic and macroeconomic variables are given in Table 1.
Specifically, Table 1 describes the projections for the annual population growth rate,
annual GDP growth rate, annual growth rate of income, and annual growth rate of
GDP per capita till the target year 2030 (Ministry of Environment, Energy and Climate

2.2.2 Target 2020 scenario—TAR20

The second scenario is based on the European target set in 2007, in order to develop
an energy-efficient and low-carbon Europe via an increase in the share of the EU
energy consumption produced from renewable resources to 20%. According to the
government and to the Law L3851/2010, it is stated that the protection of the climate
or the reduction of GHG emissions, through the promotion of electrical energy
production from RES, is a crucial element of the energy sector of the country. In
order to achieve the national target of 20% contribution of the energy produced from
RES to the gross final energy consumption, specific targets include increasing RES
electricity share by 40%, RES heating and cooling share for the household sector by
20%, and RES transport share by 10%. This target will be achieved through the large
penetration of RES technologies in electricity production, heat supply, and in the
transport sector.
The changes in the demographic and macroeconomic variables that are used in
the target 2020 scenario are also presented in Table 1. Finally, we assume a 50%
increase of RES capacity, which corresponds to 5311.7 MW. Specifically, as the
Hellenic Transmission System Operator S.A. publishes binding and final offers for
connection system or network for power stations of renewable energy and stations and
cogeneration plants of electricity and heat and high performance (CHP), we assume that
till 2020, half of the nonbinding offers will be achieved. Table 2 describes in details the
structure of the assumed generated capacity per RES category.

2.2.3 Target 2030 scenario—TAR30

We follow the target set in 22 January 2014 by the European Commission toward a
renewable energy economy. Specifically, the share of renewable energy penetration in
final consumption is set to increase at least up to 27% by 2030. This will be achieved
by the introduction of RES in industry. Following Heaps et al. (2009) concerning the
industry sector, CO2 emissions can be further reduced through the increased use of
biomass, natural gas, and increased participation of RES in electricity, the iron and

steel production sector, the cement production, the chemical production, and other
industrial subsectors. As far as the changes in demographic and macroeconomic variables
that are used in the target 2030 scenario, these are given also in Table 1. Furthermore, we
assume a 100% increase of RES capacity, which corresponds to 10,563.2 MW. Specifically,
as in the previous scenario and relying on the Hellenic Transmission System Operator
S.A., the last column of Table 2 describes in details the structure of the assumed generated
capacity per RES category.
2.2.4 Green scenario—green

Under this scenario, we follow as in TAR30 the target set in 22 January 2014 by the
European Commission toward a renewable energy economy. However, and in contrast
to TAR30, we assume that the share of renewable energy penetration in final consumption
is set to increase at least up to 27% by 2020 instead of 2030. The same assumptions
imposed for TAR30 are also imposed for the green scenario; however, under the green
scenario, the Greek government should increase the share of energy consumption
produced from renewable resources to 27% by 2020.
Figure 1 presents the projections of GHG emissions for the sectors of industry, transport,
and energy. As can be observed, industry produces the lowest levels of GHG emissions,
whereas the transport sector produces the highest GHG emission levels. As can be viewed,
the emissions produced by the Greek industry have been declined especially during
the financial crisis period. The same is reported for the energy sector. However, the
emissions generated by the transport sector have been monotonically increasing (Base
and TAR20 scenarios). In all cases as expected and under the base scenario, the sectors
will be generating higher levels of GHG emissions compared to the green scenario.
Finally, Figure 2 presents the estimated energy consumption from RES under the four
scenarios. It can be viewed that under the green scenario, the different sectors will have
more investments on RES and therefore the consumption levels will be higher. However,
again it can be noticed that the energy levels generated from RES of the industry sector
(Figure 2a) will be significantly lower compared to the sectors of transport (Figure 2b) and
energy (Figure 2c).
2.3 Data Envelopment Analysis

In order to evaluate the efficiency of the Greek government’s energy policies, we need
to evaluate also their ability to reduce greenhouse gases under the four renewable energy
policy scenarios described previously (BAU, TAR20, TAR30, and green). Specifically, we
need to evaluate under the four scenarios generated in LEAP for the period 1990–2030
the estimated energy usage of renewable sources of the Greek main sectors (industry, transport, and energy) alongside with the generated GHG produced. This can be accomplished by creating a composite performance index which can be comparable
among the four renewable energy scenarios and among the sectors for the period
1990–2030. As a result, this will enable us to evaluate the efficiency of the renewable
energy policy (EREP) based on the future estimates produced using LEAP.5
In order to do so, we apply a nonparametric approach known as data envelopment
analysis (DEA). DEA is a mathematical programming technique which enables us to
evaluate a specific process which is based on the estimation of a benchmark frontier—a
relative frontier against which the decision making units (DMUs) are assessed, using
specified DMUs’ inputs and outputs (Daraio and Simar 2007). Then, the efficiency is
calculated as the distance of each DMU from the estimated (“efficient”) frontier. In our
analysis, we treat as DMU each year which reflects the outcome of the renewable energy
policies adopted among the four sectors.
Typically, the DEA methodology is applied in a production framework investigating
the efficiency of specific inputs to produce specific outputs. However, in our study, we
follow a similar approach as the one initiated by Kuosmanen and Kortelainen (2005).
They suggest an eco-efficiency indicator which involves the calculation of the ratio of
value added (i.e., the good output/GDP) to the environmental damage or pressure index
(i.e., the bad output/pollutant), approaching therefore the environmental efficiency from a
social point of view rather than from the managerial point of view. Therefore, their
proposed index excludes the primary production factors even though they are important
cost factors in technical and economic efficiency analysis (Kuosmanen and Kortelainen
2005, p. 64).
In our case, the value added to the Greek economy and society (from the renewable
energy policy perceptive) is the energy consumption (measured in million gigajoules)
derived from renewable sources. In contrast, the bad output is the greenhouse emissions (CO2, CH4, and N2O) which will be produced in the future (based on the scenarios entered
in LEAP) from the sectors of industry, energy, and transport and are the products of bad
design, adoption, and implementation of renewable energy policies.
Based on the approach by Koopmans (1951), we can define the efficiency of renewable
energy policy in a multiple dimensional Euclidean space. For the purpose of our analysis,
let us have Mpollutants (greenhouse emissions—CO2, CH4, and N2O) measured by the
variablesu = (u1, …, um)and letρ denote the energy demand of the three sectors derived
only from renewable energy sources (measured in million gigajoules). As a result, we will
be able to define the pollution generating technology set as:

T¼

1þM
ðρ; uÞ∈ℜþ jthe energy consumption derived from renewable sources ρ
can be generated also with damage u derived from non‐renewable energy sources



ð1Þ
Expression (1) implies that even though and under the specified energy scenarios,
there will be a specific percentage of commitment of energy consumption from renewable
sources; however, there will be also pollution generated from energy consumption from
nonrenewable sources. Therefore, in our case, the efficiency of the renewable energy policies
(EREP) implemented by the Greek government will have the aim to reduce the generated
pollution. This efficiency can be represented as:
EREP n ¼

Ρn
DðUn Þ

ð2Þ

In ratio (2), D represents the damage function of the Mpollutants in a weighted average
indicator represented as:
DðuÞ ¼ v1 u1 þ v2 u2 þ … þ vm um

ð3Þ

Since the problem of a proper weight (v)on the pollutants is crucial, we follow Kuosmanen
and Kortelainen (2005) suggesting the benefit-of-the-doubt weighting scheme. This
approach applies weights that maximize the relative EREP of the evaluated year and industry in comparison with the maximum attainable EREP. This can be calculated as:6
max EREP n ¼
v

⋮
ΡN
≤1:
v1 U N1þv2 U N2þvM U NM

ð4Þ

v1 ; v2 ; …; vM ≥0
Therefore, we use weights vm(m = 1, …, M)to maximize the EREP ratio, subject to the
condition that the highest attainable efficiency score does not exceed the maximum
index value of 1 when the same weights are applied across all other years and industries.
As can be observed, the weights are not negative and the efficiency score can take the
values between 0 and 1. As can be realized, the value of 1 indicates an efficient renewable
energy policy whereas values below 1 indicate inefficient policies. Furthermore, the program in (4) is fractional and is difficult to be solved. However, by following
Charnes and Cooper (1962) and Charnes et al. (1978), we can transform the fractional program presented in (4) into a linear program as:
minv EREP −1 ¼ v1

For the purpose of our analysis, we apply the distance function approach by Shephard
(1970) allowing also for variable returns to scale (VRS) (Banker et al. 1984). Since our
analysis is based over a large period of time (1990–2030), it is expected that there will
be a lot of variations involved in the demand of energy from renewable sources and
variations among the pollutants generated from the consumption of nonrenewable energy sources. According to several authors, the assumption of VRS is more suitable
when investigating the impact of changing energy use over time and you expect such
variations (Honma and Hu 2013; Fang et al. 2013).

3 Results and discussion
As analyzed previously, we compared for each sector separately the EREP for each year
between the four scenarios. More analytically, Figure 3 presents the kernel density plots
of the estimated efficiency scores using Gaussian kernels (Silverman 1986).
For the case of the industry sector (Figure 3a), the results reveal that the BAU and
TAR20 scenario have identical efficiency distributions.7 Furthermore, it appears that
there is a bimodal distribution of efficiencies with a first peak around the 45% level of
efficiency and a second peak around the 75%. The bimodality is also reported for the
TAR30 and green scenarios. Again, for both scenarios, there is a first peak at the 45%
level of EREP whereas the second peak for the TAR30 is around the 87% and that for
the green scenario is around 100%. For the case of transport (Figure 3b), the twin-peak
is observed only for the green scenario with one peak around 70% of efficiency and the
second peak around 100%.
Under the BAU scenario, the distribution of the efficiencies of the renewable energy
policies over the examined period is platykurtic. This indicates that the efficiency estimates are highly dispersed and their distribution is less clustered around the mean than
in a leptokurtic distribution. Similar results can be also viewed for the efficiencies of
TAR20 and TAR30. Finally, Figure 3c presents the distribution of efficiency estimates
for the Greek energy sector. It appears that under the BAU scenario, the efficiency distribution has three peaks: one around 35%, a second one around 40%, and a third one
around 55%. Under the TAR20 and TAR30, the distribution is bimodal with a first peak
around 38% and a second peak of 45% for TAR20 and 50% for TAR30.

Similarly, under the green scenario, the distribution of efficiency is platykurtic. Figure 4
presents the efficiency estimates under the four scenarios for the three sectors under
examination. When analyzing the industry (Figure 4a), we realize that the efficiency of the
renewable energy policies adopted under the BAU and TAR 20 (same line) will decrease
over the years. That is, their ability to decrease GHG emissions over the examined period
will be weak. As a result, this indicates that the commitments made by the Greek government especially for TAR20 and BAU will be not sufficient to tackle the increased GHG
emissions. Under the TAR30, it appears that the EREP will increase after 2024, whereas
only under the green scenario, the efficiency of the Greek policy scenarios will be efficient
on reducing the projected GHG emissions.
Moreover, Figure 4b represents the efficiency levels for the Greek transport sector.
It appears that under the BAU and TAR20, the EREP will decrease over the examined
period indicating that under these two scenarios, the Greek government will not succeed on reducing efficiently the GHG emission in the sector of transport. Under the
TAR30, the efficiency will increase after 2022 whereas under the green scenario, the
efficiency will increase after 2015. Based on those assumptions and for the energy
sector, it appears that only under the green scenario the efficiency will increase.
Under the BAU scenario, the efficiency will decrease whereas under theTAR20 and
TAR30, the efficiencies are in similar efficiency levels.

4 Conclusions
The paper analyzes four long-term renewable energy scenarios by using LEAP software
for the three Greek sectors. We present the energy consumption estimates from RES
and the GHG emissions generated over the period of 1990–2030 for the sectors of industry,
transport, and energy. In a second stage analysis, we use DEA methodology in order to
evaluate the efficiency of renewable energy commitments on decreasing GHG emissions.
The results reveal that the efficiency of renewable energy commitments set by the Greek
government under the Law L3851/2010 will not be sufficient to decrease systematically the generated GHG emissions over the examined period. In order for the Greek government to
have more effective emission-reducing results, it should increase the share of energy consumption produced from renewable resources at least up to 27% by 2020. This in turn will
decrease significantly more the generated GHG emissions compared to the energy policies
which are based on the original commitments set by the Law L3851/2010.
