Abstract: The end of the 20th century was preserving and handing down the concept of economic
growth as the main goal of most of the governments and economic advisers, even if the world was
integrating in a mondialist system. This economic model lasted for a long time, but it will not survive the 21 st
century, when the development of nations will depend increasingly on the security of natural resources.
Progress now depends on a much more profound economic transformation than it has been possible so far,
especially since countries around the world rely on the availability of renewable and nonrenewable
resources to meet their rising needs and expectations. The transition from the traditional economic paradigm
to that based on the sustainable or ecological economy takes years of changes at all levels – from theory to
practice. The aim of this paper is to introduce the progressive visions of some outstanding specialists who
have looked for solutions to make a sustainable economy possible. The transition to a world sustainable
economy implies admitting the fact that human economy is just a part of the global ecosystem which
encompasses it.

Key words: nonrenewable resources, renewable resources, solar technologies, sustainable
development.

1. OVERVIEW OF THE CURRENT STATE OF NONRENEWABLE RESOURCES

Natural resources have always underlain the development of society, but for a long time
economists understood and assimilated their importance only from the perspective of gaining. The
ecological crisis that mankind is experiencing at the moment, heightened by the outbreak of the
energy and raw materials crisis in the ’70s, has led to an increase in the economists’ level of

depletion of resources leaves its mark on the activities in every field, their rational use converting
into a unanimous aspiration.
Along the years people started to talk more and more about eco-development as being a
complex relationship between economic development and the environment, and this has happened
because the society became aware of the fact that the irrational exploitation of nature and its
indiscriminate use can have, besides beneficial results on wellfare in general, unfavourable
consequences on the ecological equilibrium.
However, the vast majority of economists (neoclassicals, marxists, keynesians or postkeynesians) have ignored the ecological aspect, the environmental impact. They have often been
inclined to dissociate economy from the ecological framework, to which it is fundamentally,
interdependently related, and most of their basic concepts were no longer appropriate for describing
economic activities.
The situation is worsened by the fact that most economists avoid to explicitly admit the value
system their models are based on, and tacitly accept the set of strongly unbalanced values which
dominate human culture and are embodied in its social instituions. These values have led to an
excessive focus on technology, on huge consumption and the accelerated exploitation of natural
resources, all this being motivated by the persistent obsession regarding growth. Undifferentiated
economic, technological and institutional growth is still regarded by most economists as the sign of
a “sound” economy, although it now causes ecological disasters, widely spread corporate crime,
social disintegration and a higher probability of nuclear war. (Capra, p.505)
What is paradoxical is that economists seem to not be able to adopt a dynamic view, despite
their obsession regarding gowth. Their tendency is to arbitrarily freeze the economy in its current
institutional structure, instead of seeing it as a constantly changing and evolving system, dependent
on the alteration of the ecological and social systems which encompass it.

2. POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS
In the context described above, the adequate presentation of economy in its social and
ecological aspects requires that the basic concepts and the variables of economic theories are
correlated with the ones used to describe the social and ecological systems. This involves a
multidisciplinary approach to the economic system, developed by numerous scientists over time.
Outstanding people, such as Nicholas Georgescu Roegen, Fridjof Capra and Lester R. Brown
– whose vision finds perfect fulfilment nowadays – have written about restoring balance and

According to them, growth has to be rational and maintain a dynamic balance between growth and
decline, so that the system as a whole remains flexible and open to change.

2.1 Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen

Along time, Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen has proved to be the first professional economist of
Romanian origin, who addressed the issue of the human species’ economy in a global ecological
context in a thorough manner (he was the one who studied the determining role of entropy on
economic life). In his fundamental paper – “The Entropy Law and the Economic Process”, he
presents the criticism of the classical and neoclassical “standard” economic theory, which is blamed
for its newtonian mechanism, that has developed great and real possibilities of autoregeneration.
According to it, all we do is pursue a global economy whose functioning is based upon the second
law of thermodynamics, which states that nothing is lost, nothing is created, everything is
transformed. Starting from this principle, standard economists have presented the economic activity
as the movement of a pendulum between supply and demand, where any disturbance can be
overcome by a “correct price”, which can only be the price of the free market. However, Roegen
draws attention to the fact that this entire demonstration was conducted in a purely ideatic, abstract
environment, completely detached from the physical one, the possibility of natural resource
depletion not representing a matter of interest standard economists.
Being unsatisfied with the solutions offered either by the classical theory, or, even more so,
by the neoclassical one, Roegen tried to impose his own paradigm, asserting that “the economic
process is, by its very nature, entropic and that the entropy law 1 governs both this process and its
evolution”. According to the outstanding economist, once the resources of the globe have been
exhausted, they become impossible to use in the future. In the classical economic theory, the needs
of the future generations are not taken into consideration at all. The same applies to business, where
nobody speaks about the ones who will live on this planet, those people who start their ever poorer
living regarding energy supply. The only solution to protect future generations against the presentday loss of energy is our own re-training – towards the responsibility based on care and love for the
human being – our future associate. Love for your own species is the key to solving tomorrow’s

Entropy represents the constant alteration of energy in a system of the universe. From an economic point of view,
entropy expresses the process of alteration of material and energy resources, a process which takes place both at the
level of the economic life, determined by people’s actions and control, and outside it. The entropy of any system
characterises its degree of disorder. (Bran, P., Economica valorii, Editura ASE , Bucureşti, 2002, p. 45).

generation will be substantially diminished within the framework of an economy rightly called
bioeconomy.
Taking these reality into account, Georgescu-Roegen conceptualises a few elements, which he
includes in a Minimal Bioeconomic Programme, capable of providing a balanced and long-lasting
standard of living for humankind, such as: avoiding the loss of any kind of energy or mass; freeing
the today’s man from his morbid tendencies to produce and consume all kinds of new products; the
necessity for the producers of goods (commodities) to focus on product durability, on their ease of
use and particularly on their maintenance and repair (Drăgan and Demetrescu, 1994).
However, N. Georgescu-Roegen did not make any illusions that his programme could be
easily adopted, that his recommendations, expressed almost as aphorisms, could be followed, at
least not in a foreseeable future, because, the great thinker concluded, maybe man’s destiny is that
of a short, yet intense, exciting and extravagant instead of a long, passive existence, lacking in
events. Some live long, others live fast, here is a formula which can function just as well for people
as for species. But even so, Roegen’s opinion is that man does not have the right to act to the
detriment of the other living species which populate the Earth.

2.2 Fridjof Capra
Another visionary of our times, Fridjof Capra – physicist and system theoretician, brings
some additional valuable ideas to the formerly described perspective, and in one of his books “The
Turning Point: Science, Society and the Rising Culture” he suggests a systemic approach to
economy, in order to bring order into this conceptual chaos, providing the necessary environmental
perspective. From a systemic viewpoint, economy is a living system, made up of human beings,
social organisms (institutions) and the ecosystems which surround them, which are in continuous
interdependence.
According to the systemic vision, the economy, regarded as a living system, is healthy if it is
in a state of dynamic equilibrium, characterized by continuous fluctuations of its variables. To
achieve and maintain such a healthy economic system, it is crucial to preserve the ecological
flexibility of the natural environment and to create the social flexibility needed to adapt to
environmental changes.
The fulfillment of this goal does not mean a return to the past, but the development of new
forms of technology and social organization, because many of the conventional, resource-intensive,
highly centralised technologies are now outdated.

Their advantages consist in the fact that they can be used on a small scale, in a decentralized
manner, they can respond to local conditions and can be designed so as to increase the degree of
autonomy, providing a maximum degree of flexibility. Thus, they are often called “soft
technologies”, because their environmental impact is much more reduced by the use of renewable
resources and the constant recycling of materials. Examples of such soft technologies are solar
collectors, wind generators and organic agriculture (Capra, 2004, p. 508).
Moving from "hard" technologies to the "soft" ones is needed in areas related to energy
production. The deepest roots of the current energy crisis can be found in irrational production and
consumption patterns that have become characteristic for our society. In order to solve the crisis,
there is no need of more energy, as it would enhance the existing problems, but of deep changes
regarding values, attitudes and lifestyles. Nevertheless, while this long-term goal is being pursued,
we must as well replace the use of nonrenewable resources for energy production with renewable
resources and make the transition from “hard” to “soft” technologies, so as to achieve an ecological
balance.
Currently, most energy policies of the industrialised countries reflect the intensive use of
natural resources, energy being produced from nonrenewable resources - oil, natural gas, coal and
uranium – through centralized, rigidly programmed technologies, which are wasteful and unhealthy.
However, nuclear energy is by far the most dangerous element of using “hard” natural resources.
A healthy way of solving the energy crisis would be a "softer" approach of energy production,
which would involve the following main aspects (Capra, 2004, p.510): energy conservation through
more efficient consumption, intelligent use of nonrenewable resources as "bridge fuels" during the
transition period and the rapid development of “soft” technologies for energy production out of
renewable sources. Such a threefold approach would not only be favourable to the environment and
ecologically balanced, but it would also be the cheapest and the most efficient energy policy. A
Harvard Business School study showed that increasing efficiency and investments in new
technologies represent the most economical sources of energy, providing a greater number of work
places (Capra, 1979 in Stobaugh et al., 2004).
The reality is that on the long term, we need a renewable energy source, economically
efficient and environmentally benign. Solar energy is the only type of energy that meets these
criteria. The sun has been the main source of energy for our planet for billions of years, and life, in
its countless forms, has resourcefully adapted to solar energy throughout the planetary evolution.
All the energy we use, with the exception of nuclear power, represents a stored form of solar
energy. (Capra, 2004, p.513).

competitive compared to conventional energy sources, but this is not true. Some forms of solar
energy are already competitive; others can become so in a few years’ time. “Many people still
suppose that solar energy is something related to the future and wait for a technological discovery.
This supposition represents an error, as active and passive solar heating is present here and now as
an alternative to the conventinal sources of energy”, shows the Harvard Business School study
(Capra, 1979 in Stobaugh et al., 2004).
Other technologies with tremendous potential are the photovoltaic and wind generators,
which would bring about fundamental structural changes for the utilities industry. Today the major
obstacle to rapid development of new technologies is represented by the utilities companies that are
unwilling to give up their monopoly in the field of electricity production.
F. Capra states that the way towards a solar future is open and all that is necessary is accurate
public information about the solar energy potential, together with appropriate social and economic
policies, so as to facilitate the transition to the solar era. At the same time, the renowned
theoretician offers the example of Barry Commoner, a man who designed a detailed scenario for
replacing most of the unrenewable energy sources with solar energy on a 50-year timespan scale.
(Capra, 1979 in Commoner, 2004). His proposal neither entails major technological innovations,
nor does it depend on drastic measures of energy preservation. The key to the project is the role of
natural gas as main bridge fuel. The underlying idea is the increase of production, the extension of
the current natural gas distribution grid and, afterwards, the gradual replacing of natural gas with
methane from solar sources. In order to do so, methane-generating devices have to be built
whereever there is a sufficient amount of biomass available.
According to Commoner’s scheme, which, of course, is only one of the numerous possible
plans, the initial step of the transition would consist in putting up gas generators wherever it is
possible and building more extensive gas distribution grids for their supply. At the same time,
active and passive solar heating systems would expand and greater and greater amounts of solar
methane made out of biomass would be added to natural gas in the distribution grid. The use of
photovoltaic cells and wind generators would significantly increase in a few years’ time and the
total production of solar energy would gradually increase until reaching approximately 20% of the
total energy budget in 25 years’ time. At that stage, in the middle of the transition period, both
solar energy and natural gas put together would make up a little bit more than half of the total
energy budget of a state, which would make it possible to completely eliminate the reliance on
nuclear energy. In the second half of the transition, oil and coal needs would progressively
decrease down to zero and the natural gas production would fall to around half of the present-day

10% natural gas share could be cut out, but it would be important to maintain this source of energy
as a backup, in order to compensate for the irregularities brought about by climate fluctuations
(Capra, 2004, p. 520).
The main obstacles against the solar transition are not technical, but political. The transition
from nonrenewable to renewable resources forces oil companies to give up their dominant role in
the world economy and fundamentally alter their activities. One solution would be for most of the
oil companies to invest in innovative businesses, as many of them have already started. Certainly,
problems will arise in other industries, as solar transition generates conflicts between social and
private interests. In F. Capra's view, the soft energy path would obviously serve the interest of all
energy users, but a reasonable transition to the solar era would only be possible if we are able, as a
society, to put long-term social advantages above short-term personal gains.

2.3. Lester R. Brown

One of the best-known scientists in the world - Lester R. Brown - is the founder of the
Worldwatch Institute, and founder and president of the Earth Policy Institute. The Telegraph of
Calcutta refers to him as "the guru of the environmental movement", and the Washington Post
called him "one of the world's most influential thinkers."
With the help of the institute set up by him, he published yearly reports called: Global Issues
of Humankind – State of the World, translated into 35 languages and released at the same time in
different countries around the world. Through papers such as the one published in 2003 “Plan B,
Rescuing a Planet under Stress and a Civilization in Trouble”, considered by many specialists to be
of the same magnitude as the first Report to the Club of Rome in 1974, he warned the global
community about the major dangers humankind and nature are facing. In order to avoid the
destruction of the planet, Lester Brown comes up with the following proposals: setting up a budget
for the recovery of the planet through the UNO and its financial programs; using current techniques
for protecting and restoring the environment; promoting the recycling of raw materials, a process
which takes place naturally in the environment; a short stage for the transition from the use of fossil
fuels (oil, natural gas, coal) to the use of renewable resources (wind, biomass, hydrogen,
photovoltaic devices, tides).
Thus, setting up a new global economic model has become the great challenge of the century,
which has generated answers such as Brown’s B Plans (taking into account the fact that the so-

decline and, eventually, towards collapse).
Finally, a middle path which realistically integrates the requirements of a global economic
model and the ecological aspirations of the future generations is represented by the “society of
moderation” project. The essential problem is finding a balance between the existing natural
capacities and the needs (present and future) of the society. The human ecological footprint has
become so heavy that the planet is seriously affected. The rapacious character of the “consumer
society” is strongly denounced.
Both the exaggerated individual consumption model and its collective expression and the
western model which the societies of the emerging countries have drawn the conclusion they should
follow in order to develop are thus challenged. Extremes can never constitute a viable solution. We
can neither preach for a utopian economic de-growth, nor continue on the same path, believing that
adaptation will occur owing to the force of circumstances. On the contrary, tools must be identified
and promoted in order to allow a reduction in fossil energy consumption, in the material and
resource flows. We do not need to become a society of privation, but a society of moderation, and
in L. Brown’s opinion, we must do it quickly, as the world of tomorrow, whether we like it or not,
will be radically different from that of today.

3. CONCLUSIONS

People have long lived under the impression that progress is linear, that every day will bring
about a step forward. The only thing is that the current “market” logic fatally leads to the opposite
direction. However, a new logic can progressively be substituted to it. But, in order for that to be
possible, the foundations of the present society must be amended and the “philosophical stone”,
which would allow the conciliation between the maintenance of economic and social growth and
the good management of the environmental issues, must be found.
In an era of extremes, the middle path seems to be the most appropriate, as well as the most
feasible in approaching such an issue. Thus, the rational use of natural resources is the main mean
of achieving an efficient increase in production, which can be accomplished by saving the factors of
production in the process of extracting and processing them. Thus, technical and scientific progress
(the informational resource) and the use of human potential (the only abundant resource) become
the main tools for solving the contradictions between the continuous increase of social needs and
the limited possibilities that the environment provides.

Abstract: The end of the 20th century was preserving and handing down the concept of economic
growth as the main goal of most of the governments and economic advisers, even if the world was
integrating in a mondialist system. This economic model lasted for a long time, but it will not survive the 21 st
century, when the development of nations will depend increasingly on the security of natural resources.
Progress now depends on a much more profound economic transformation than it has been possible so far,
especially since countries around the world rely on the availability of renewable and nonrenewable
resources to meet their rising needs and expectations. The transition from the traditional economic paradigm
to that based on the sustainable or ecological economy takes years of changes at all levels – from theory to
practice. The aim of this paper is to introduce the progressive visions of some outstanding specialists who
have looked for solutions to make a sustainable economy possible. The transition to a world sustainable
economy implies admitting the fact that human economy is just a part of the global ecosystem which
encompasses it.

Key words: nonrenewable resources, renewable resources, solar technologies, sustainable

1. OVERVIEW OF THE CURRENT STATE OF NONRENEWABLE RESOURCES

Natural resources have always underlain the development of society, but for a long time
economists understood and assimilated their importance only from the perspective of gaining. The
ecological crisis that mankind is experiencing at the moment, heightened by the outbreak of the
energy and raw materials crisis in the ’70s, has led to an increase in the economists’ level of

depletion of resources leaves its mark on the activities in every field, their rational use converting
into a unanimous aspiration.
Along the years people started to talk more and more about eco-development as being a
complex relationship between economic development and the environment, and this has happened
because the society became aware of the fact that the irrational exploitation of nature and its
indiscriminate use can have, besides beneficial results on wellfare in general, unfavourable
consequences on the ecological equilibrium.
However, the vast majority of economists (neoclassicals, marxists, keynesians or postkeynesians) have ignored the ecological aspect, the environmental impact. They have often been
inclined to dissociate economy from the ecological framework, to which it is fundamentally,
interdependently related, and most of their basic concepts were no longer appropriate for describing
economic activities.
The situation is worsened by the fact that most economists avoid to explicitly admit the value
system their models are based on, and tacitly accept the set of strongly unbalanced values which
dominate human culture and are embodied in its social instituions. These values have led to an
excessive focus on technology, on huge consumption and the accelerated exploitation of natural
resources, all this being motivated by the persistent obsession regarding growth. Undifferentiated
economic, technological and institutional growth is still regarded by most economists as the sign of
a “sound” economy, although it now causes ecological disasters, widely spread corporate crime,
social disintegration and a higher probability of nuclear war. (Capra, p.505)
What is paradoxical is that economists seem to not be able to adopt a dynamic view, despite
their obsession regarding gowth. Their tendency is to arbitrarily freeze the economy in its current
institutional structure, instead of seeing it as a constantly changing and evolving system, dependent
on the alteration of the ecological and social systems which encompass it.

2. POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS
In the context described above, the adequate presentation of economy in its social and
ecological aspects requires that the basic concepts and the variables of economic theories are
correlated with the ones used to describe the social and ecological systems. This involves a
multidisciplinary approach to the economic system, developed by numerous scientists over time.
Outstanding people, such as Nicholas Georgescu Roegen, Fridjof Capra and Lester R. Brown
– whose vision finds perfect fulfilment nowadays – have written about restoring balance and

According to them, growth has to be rational and maintain a dynamic balance between growth and
decline, so that the system as a whole remains flexible and open to change.

2.1 Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen

Along time, Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen has proved to be the first professional economist of
Romanian origin, who addressed the issue of the human species’ economy in a global ecological
context in a thorough manner (he was the one who studied the determining role of entropy on
economic life). In his fundamental paper – “The Entropy Law and the Economic Process”, he
presents the criticism of the classical and neoclassical “standard” economic theory, which is blamed
for its newtonian mechanism, that has developed great and real possibilities of autoregeneration.
According to it, all we do is pursue a global economy whose functioning is based upon the second
law of thermodynamics, which states that nothing is lost, nothing is created, everything is
transformed. Starting from this principle, standard economists have presented the economic activity
as the movement of a pendulum between supply and demand, where any disturbance can be
overcome by a “correct price”, which can only be the price of the free market. However, Roegen
draws attention to the fact that this entire demonstration was conducted in a purely ideatic, abstract
environment, completely detached from the physical one, the possibility of natural resource
depletion not representing a matter of interest standard economists.
Being unsatisfied with the solutions offered either by the classical theory, or, even more so,
by the neoclassical one, Roegen tried to impose his own paradigm, asserting that “the economic
process is, by its very nature, entropic and that the entropy law 1 governs both this process and its
evolution”. According to the outstanding economist, once the resources of the globe have been
exhausted, they become impossible to use in the future. In the classical economic theory, the needs
of the future generations are not taken into consideration at all. The same applies to business, where
nobody speaks about the ones who will live on this planet, those people who start their ever poorer
living regarding energy supply. The only solution to protect future generations against the presentday loss of energy is our own re-training – towards the responsibility based on care and love for the
human being – our future associate. Love for your own species is the key to solving tomorrow’s
1

Entropy represents the constant alteration of energy in a system of the universe. From an economic point of view,
entropy expresses the process of alteration of material and energy resources, a process which takes place both at the
level of the economic life, determined by people’s actions and control, and outside it. The entropy of any system
characterises its degree of disorder. (Bran, P., Economica valorii, Editura ASE , Bucureşti, 2002, p. 45).

generation will be substantially diminished within the framework of an economy rightly called
bioeconomy.
Taking these reality into account, Georgescu-Roegen conceptualises a few elements, which he
includes in a Minimal Bioeconomic Programme, capable of providing a balanced and long-lasting
standard of living for humankind, such as: avoiding the loss of any kind of energy or mass; freeing
the today’s man from his morbid tendencies to produce and consume all kinds of new products; the
necessity for the producers of goods (commodities) to focus on product durability, on their ease of
use and particularly on their maintenance and repair (Drăgan and Demetrescu, 1994).
However, N. Georgescu-Roegen did not make any illusions that his programme could be
easily adopted, that his recommendations, expressed almost as aphorisms, could be followed, at
least not in a foreseeable future, because, the great thinker concluded, maybe man’s destiny is that
of a short, yet intense, exciting and extravagant instead of a long, passive existence, lacking in
events. Some live long, others live fast, here is a formula which can function just as well for people
as for species. But even so, Roegen’s opinion is that man does not have the right to act to the
detriment of the other living species which populate the Earth.

2.2 Fridjof Capra
Another visionary of our times, Fridjof Capra – physicist and system theoretician, brings
some additional valuable ideas to the formerly described perspective, and in one of his books “The
Turning Point: Science, Society and the Rising Culture” he suggests a systemic approach to
economy, in order to bring order into this conceptual chaos, providing the necessary environmental
perspective. From a systemic viewpoint, economy is a living system, made up of human beings,
social organisms (institutions) and the ecosystems which surround them, which are in continuous
interdependence.
According to the systemic vision, the economy, regarded as a living system, is healthy if it is
in a state of dynamic equilibrium, characterized by continuous fluctuations of its variables. To
achieve and maintain such a healthy economic system, it is crucial to preserve the ecological
flexibility of the natural environment and to create the social flexibility needed to adapt to
environmental changes.
The fulfillment of this goal does not mean a return to the past, but the development of new
forms of technology and social organization, because many of the conventional, resource-intensive,
highly centralised technologies are now outdated.

Their advantages consist in the fact that they can be used on a small scale, in a decentralized
manner, they can respond to local conditions and can be designed so as to increase the degree of
autonomy, providing a maximum degree of flexibility. Thus, they are often called “soft
technologies”, because their environmental impact is much more reduced by the use of renewable
resources and the constant recycling of materials. Examples of such soft technologies are solar
collectors, wind generators and organic agriculture (Capra, 2004, p. 508).
Moving from "hard" technologies to the "soft" ones is needed in areas related to energy
production. The deepest roots of the current energy crisis can be found in irrational production and
consumption patterns that have become characteristic for our society. In order to solve the crisis,
there is no need of more energy, as it would enhance the existing problems, but of deep changes
regarding values, attitudes and lifestyles. Nevertheless, while this long-term goal is being pursued,
we must as well replace the use of nonrenewable resources for energy production with renewable
resources and make the transition from “hard” to “soft” technologies, so as to achieve an ecological
balance.
Currently, most energy policies of the industrialised countries reflect the intensive use of
natural resources, energy being produced from nonrenewable resources - oil, natural gas, coal and
uranium – through centralized, rigidly programmed technologies, which are wasteful and unhealthy.
However, nuclear energy is by far the most dangerous element of using “hard” natural resources.
A healthy way of solving the energy crisis would be a "softer" approach of energy production,
which would involve the following main aspects (Capra, 2004, p.510): energy conservation through
more efficient consumption, intelligent use of nonrenewable resources as "bridge fuels" during the
transition period and the rapid development of “soft” technologies for energy production out of
renewable sources. Such a threefold approach would not only be favourable to the environment and
ecologically balanced, but it would also be the cheapest and the most efficient energy policy. A
Harvard Business School study showed that increasing efficiency and investments in new
technologies represent the most economical sources of energy, providing a greater number of work
places (Capra, 1979 in Stobaugh et al., 2004).
The reality is that on the long term, we need a renewable energy source, economically
efficient and environmentally benign. Solar energy is the only type of energy that meets these
criteria. The sun has been the main source of energy for our planet for billions of years, and life, in
its countless forms, has resourcefully adapted to solar energy throughout the planetary evolution.
All the energy we use, with the exception of nuclear power, represents a stored form of solar
energy. (Capra, 2004, p.513).

competitive compared to conventional energy sources, but this is not true. Some forms of solar
energy are already competitive; others can become so in a few years’ time. “Many people still
suppose that solar energy is something related to the future and wait for a technological discovery.
This supposition represents an error, as active and passive solar heating is present here and now as
an alternative to the conventinal sources of energy”, shows the Harvard Business School study
(Capra, 1979 in Stobaugh et al., 2004).
Other technologies with tremendous potential are the photovoltaic and wind generators,
which would bring about fundamental structural changes for the utilities industry. Today the major
obstacle to rapid development of new technologies is represented by the utilities companies that are
unwilling to give up their monopoly in the field of electricity production.
F. Capra states that the way towards a solar future is open and all that is necessary is accurate
public information about the solar energy potential, together with appropriate social and economic
policies, so as to facilitate the transition to the solar era. At the same time, the renowned
theoretician offers the example of Barry Commoner, a man who designed a detailed scenario for
replacing most of the unrenewable energy sources with solar energy on a 50-year timespan scale.
(Capra, 1979 in Commoner, 2004). His proposal neither entails major technological innovations,
nor does it depend on drastic measures of energy preservation. The key to the project is the role of
natural gas as main bridge fuel. The underlying idea is the increase of production, the extension of
the current natural gas distribution grid and, afterwards, the gradual replacing of natural gas with
methane from solar sources. In order to do so, methane-generating devices have to be built
whereever there is a sufficient amount of biomass available.
According to Commoner’s scheme, which, of course, is only one of the numerous possible
plans, the initial step of the transition would consist in putting up gas generators wherever it is
possible and building more extensive gas distribution grids for their supply. At the same time,
active and passive solar heating systems would expand and greater and greater amounts of solar
methane made out of biomass would be added to natural gas in the distribution grid. The use of
photovoltaic cells and wind generators would significantly increase in a few years’ time and the
total production of solar energy would gradually increase until reaching approximately 20% of the
total energy budget in 25 years’ time. At that stage, in the middle of the transition period, both
solar energy and natural gas put together would make up a little bit more than half of the total
energy budget of a state, which would make it possible to completely eliminate the reliance on
nuclear energy. In the second half of the transition, oil and coal needs would progressively
decrease down to zero and the natural gas production would fall to around half of the present-day

10% natural gas share could be cut out, but it would be important to maintain this source of energy
as a backup, in order to compensate for the irregularities brought about by climate fluctuations
(Capra, 2004, p. 520).
The main obstacles against the solar transition are not technical, but political. The transition
from nonrenewable to renewable resources forces oil companies to give up their dominant role in
the world economy and fundamentally alter their activities. One solution would be for most of the
oil companies to invest in innovative businesses, as many of them have already started. Certainly,
problems will arise in other industries, as solar transition generates conflicts between social and
private interests. In F. Capra's view, the soft energy path would obviously serve the interest of all
energy users, but a reasonable transition to the solar era would only be possible if we are able, as a
society, to put long-term social advantages above short-term personal gains.

2.3. Lester R. Brown

One of the best-known scientists in the world - Lester R. Brown - is the founder of the
Worldwatch Institute, and founder and president of the Earth Policy Institute. The Telegraph of
Calcutta refers to him as "the guru of the environmental movement", and the Washington Post
called him "one of the world's most influential thinkers."
With the help of the institute set up by him, he published yearly reports called: Global Issues
of Humankind – State of the World, translated into 35 languages and released at the same time in
different countries around the world. Through papers such as the one published in 2003 “Plan B,
Rescuing a Planet under Stress and a Civilization in Trouble”, considered by many specialists to be
of the same magnitude as the first Report to the Club of Rome in 1974, he warned the global
community about the major dangers humankind and nature are facing. In order to avoid the
destruction of the planet, Lester Brown comes up with the following proposals: setting up a budget
for the recovery of the planet through the UNO and its financial programs; using current techniques
for protecting and restoring the environment; promoting the recycling of raw materials, a process
which takes place naturally in the environment; a short stage for the transition from the use of fossil
fuels (oil, natural gas, coal) to the use of renewable resources (wind, biomass, hydrogen,
photovoltaic devices, tides).
Thus, setting up a new global economic model has become the great challenge of the century,
which has generated answers such as Brown’s B Plans (taking into account the fact that the so-

decline and, eventually, towards collapse).
Finally, a middle path which realistically integrates the requirements of a global economic
model and the ecological aspirations of the future generations is represented by the “society of
moderation” project. The essential problem is finding a balance between the existing natural
capacities and the needs (present and future) of the society. The human ecological footprint has
become so heavy that the planet is seriously affected. The rapacious character of the “consumer
society” is strongly denounced.
Both the exaggerated individual consumption model and its collective expression and the
western model which the societies of the emerging countries have drawn the conclusion they should
follow in order to develop are thus challenged. Extremes can never constitute a viable solution. We
can neither preach for a utopian economic de-growth, nor continue on the same path, believing that
adaptation will occur owing to the force of circumstances. On the contrary, tools must be identified
and promoted in order to allow a reduction in fossil energy consumption, in the material and
resource flows. We do not need to become a society of privation, but a society of moderation, and
in L. Brown’s opinion, we must do it quickly, as the world of tomorrow, whether we like it or not,
will be radically different from that of today.

3. CONCLUSIONS

People have long lived under the impression that progress is linear, that every day will bring
about a step forward. The only thing is that the current “market” logic fatally leads to the opposite
direction. However, a new logic can progressively be substituted to it. But, in order for that to be
possible, the foundations of the present society must be amended and the “philosophical stone”,
which would allow the conciliation between the maintenance of economic and social growth and
the good management of the environmental issues, must be found.
In an era of extremes, the middle path seems to be the most appropriate, as well as the most
feasible in approaching such an issue. Thus, the rational use of natural resources is the main mean
of achieving an efficient increase in production, which can be accomplished by saving the factors of
production in the process of extracting and processing them. Thus, technical and scientific progress
(the informational resource) and the use of human potential (the only abundant resource) become
the main tools for solving the contradictions between the continuous increase of social needs and
the limited possibilities that the environment provides.

NONRENEWABLE RESOURCES – THE GATEWAY TOWARDS A SOLAR
ERA

Abstract: The end of the 20th century was preserving and handing down the concept of economic
growth as the main goal of most of the governments and economic advisers, even if the world was
integrating in a mondialist system. This economic model lasted for a long time, but it will not survive the 21 st
century, when the development of nations will depend increasingly on the security of natural resources.
Progress now depends on a much more profound economic transformation than it has been possible so far,
especially since countries around the world rely on the availability of renewable and nonrenewable
resources to meet their rising needs and expectations. The transition from the traditional economic paradigm
to that based on the sustainable or ecological economy takes years of changes at all levels – from theory to
practice. The aim of this paper is to introduce the progressive visions of some outstanding specialists who
have looked for solutions to make a sustainable economy possible. The transition to a world sustainable
economy implies admitting the fact that human economy is just a part of the global ecosystem which
encompasses it.

Key words: nonrenewable resources, renewable resources, solar technologies, sustainable
development.
JEL classification: Q01, Q32, Q42.

1. OVERVIEW OF THE CURRENT STATE OF NONRENEWABLE RESOURCES

Natural resources have always underlain the development of society, but for a long time
economists understood and assimilated their importance only from the perspective of gaining. The
ecological crisis that mankind is experiencing at the moment, heightened by the outbreak of the
energy and raw materials crisis in the ’70s, has led to an increase in the economists’ level of

depletion of resources leaves its mark on the activities in every field, their rational use converting
into a unanimous aspiration.
Along the years people started to talk more and more about eco-development as being a
complex relationship between economic development and the environment, and this has happened
because the society became aware of the fact that the irrational exploitation of nature and its
indiscriminate use can have, besides beneficial results on wellfare in general, unfavourable
consequences on the ecological equilibrium.
However, the vast majority of economists (neoclassicals, marxists, keynesians or postkeynesians) have ignored the ecological aspect, the environmental impact. They have often been
inclined to dissociate economy from the ecological framework, to which it is fundamentally,
interdependently related, and most of their basic concepts were no longer appropriate for describing
economic activities.
The situation is worsened by the fact that most economists avoid to explicitly admit the value
system their models are based on, and tacitly accept the set of strongly unbalanced values which
dominate human culture and are embodied in its social instituions. These values have led to an
excessive focus on technology, on huge consumption and the accelerated exploitation of natural
resources, all this being motivated by the persistent obsession regarding growth. Undifferentiated
economic, technological and institutional growth is still regarded by most economists as the sign of
a “sound” economy, although it now causes ecological disasters, widely spread corporate crime,
social disintegration and a higher probability of nuclear war. (Capra, p.505)
What is paradoxical is that economists seem to not be able to adopt a dynamic view, despite
their obsession regarding gowth. Their tendency is to arbitrarily freeze the economy in its current
institutional structure, instead of seeing it as a constantly changing and evolving system, dependent
on the alteration of the ecological and social systems which encompass it.

2. POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS
In the context described above, the adequate presentation of economy in its social and
ecological aspects requires that the basic concepts and the variables of economic theories are
correlated with the ones used to describe the social and ecological systems. This involves a
multidisciplinary approach to the economic system, developed by numerous scientists over time.
Outstanding people, such as Nicholas Georgescu Roegen, Fridjof Capra and Lester R. Brown
– whose vision finds perfect fulfilment nowadays – have written about restoring balance and

According to them, growth has to be rational and maintain a dynamic balance between growth and
decline, so that the system as a whole remains flexible and open to change.

2.1 Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen

Along time, Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen has proved to be the first professional economist of
Romanian origin, who addressed the issue of the human species’ economy in a global ecological
context in a thorough manner (he was the one who studied the determining role of entropy on
economic life). In his fundamental paper – “The Entropy Law and the Economic Process”, he
presents the criticism of the classical and neoclassical “standard” economic theory, which is blamed
for its newtonian mechanism, that has developed great and real possibilities of autoregeneration.
According to it, all we do is pursue a global economy whose functioning is based upon the second
law of thermodynamics, which states that nothing is lost, nothing is created, everything is
transformed. Starting from this principle, standard economists have presented the economic activity
as the movement of a pendulum between supply and demand, where any disturbance can be
overcome by a “correct price”, which can only be the price of the free market. However, Roegen
draws attention to the fact that this entire demonstration was conducted in a purely ideatic, abstract
environment, completely detached from the physical one, the possibility of natural resource
depletion not representing a matter of interest standard economists.
Being unsatisfied with the solutions offered either by the classical theory, or, even more so,
by the neoclassical one, Roegen tried to impose his own paradigm, asserting that “the economic
process is, by its very nature, entropic and that the entropy law 1 governs both this process and its
evolution”. According to the outstanding economist, once the resources of the globe have been
exhausted, they become impossible to use in the future. In the classical economic theory, the needs
of the future generations are not taken into consideration at all. The same applies to business, where
nobody speaks about the ones who will live on this planet, those people who start their ever poorer
living regarding energy supply. The only solution to protect future generations against the presentday loss of energy is our own re-training – towards the responsibility based on care and love for the
human being – our future associate. Love for your own species is the key to solving tomorrow’s
1

Entropy represents the constant alteration of energy in a system of the universe. From an economic point of view,
entropy expresses the process of alteration of material and energy resources, a process which takes place both at the
level of the economic life, determined by people’s actions and control, and outside it. The entropy of any system
characterises its degree of disorder. (Bran, P., Economica valorii, Editura ASE , Bucureşti, 2002, p. 45).

generation will be substantially diminished within the framework of an economy rightly called
bioeconomy.
Taking these reality into account, Georgescu-Roegen conceptualises a few elements, which he
includes in a Minimal Bioeconomic Programme, capable of providing a balanced and long-lasting
standard of living for humankind, such as: avoiding the loss of any kind of energy or mass; freeing
the today’s man from his morbid tendencies to produce and consume all kinds of new products; the
necessity for the producers of goods (commodities) to focus on product durability, on their ease of
use and particularly on their maintenance and repair (Drăgan and Demetrescu, 1994).
However, N. Georgescu-Roegen did not make any illusions that his programme could be
easily adopted, that his recommendations, expressed almost as aphorisms, could be followed, at
least not in a foreseeable future, because, the great thinker concluded, maybe man’s destiny is that
of a short, yet intense, exciting and extravagant instead of a long, passive existence, lacking in
events. Some live long, others live fast, here is a formula which can function just as well for people
as for species. But even so, Roegen’s opinion is that man does not have the right to act to the
detriment of the other living species which populate the Earth.

2.2 Fridjof Capra
Another visionary of our times, Fridjof Capra – physicist and system theoretician, brings
some additional valuable ideas to the formerly described perspective, and in one of his books “The
Turning Point: Science, Society and the Rising Culture” he suggests a systemic approach to
economy, in order to bring order into this conceptual chaos, providing the necessary environmental
perspective. From a systemic viewpoint, economy is a living system, made up of human beings,
social organisms (institutions) and the ecosystems which surround them, which are in continuous
interdependence.
According to the systemic vision, the economy, regarded as a living system, is healthy if it is
in a state of dynamic equilibrium, characterized by continuous fluctuations of its variables. To
achieve and maintain such a healthy economic system, it is crucial to preserve the ecological
flexibility of the natural environment and to create the social flexibility needed to adapt to
environmental changes.
The fulfillment of this goal does not mean a return to the past, but the development of new
forms of technology and social organization, because many of the conventional, resource-intensive,
highly centralised technologies are now outdated.

Their advantages consist in the fact that they can be used on a small scale, in a decentralized
manner, they can respond to local conditions and can be designed so as to increase the degree of
autonomy, providing a maximum degree of flexibility. Thus, they are often called “soft
technologies”, because their environmental impact is much more reduced by the use of renewable
resources and the constant recycling of materials. Examples of such soft technologies are solar
collectors, wind generators and organic agriculture (Capra, 2004, p. 508).
Moving from "hard" technologies to the "soft" ones is needed in areas related to energy
production. The deepest roots of the current energy crisis can be found in irrational production and
consumption patterns that have become characteristic for our society. In order to solve the crisis,
there is no need of more energy, as it would enhance the existing problems, but of deep changes
regarding values, attitudes and lifestyles. Nevertheless, while this long-term goal is being pursued,
we must as well replace the use of nonrenewable resources for energy production with renewable
resources and make the transition from “hard” to “soft” technologies, so as to achieve an ecological
balance.
Currently, most energy policies of the industrialised countries reflect the intensive use of
natural resources, energy being produced from nonrenewable resources - oil, natural gas, coal and
uranium – through centralized, rigidly programmed technologies, which are wasteful and unhealthy.
However, nuclear energy is by far the most dangerous element of using “hard” natural resources.
A healthy way of solving the energy crisis would be a "softer" approach of energy production,
which would involve the following main aspects (Capra, 2004, p.510): energy conservation through
more efficient consumption, intelligent use of nonrenewable resources as "bridge fuels" during the
transition period and the rapid development of “soft” technologies for energy production out of
renewable sources. Such a threefold approach would not only be favourable to the environment and
ecologically balanced, but it would also be the cheapest and the most efficient energy policy. A
Harvard Business School study showed that increasing efficiency and investments in new
technologies represent the most economical sources of energy, providing a greater number of work
places (Capra, 1979 in Stobaugh et al., 2004).
The reality is that on the long term, we need a renewable energy source, economically
efficient and environmentally benign. Solar energy is the only type of energy that meets these
criteria. The sun has been the main source of energy for our planet for billions of years, and life, in
its countless forms, has resourcefully adapted to solar energy throughout the planetary evolution.
All the energy we use, with the exception of nuclear power, represents a stored form of solar
energy. (Capra, 2004, p.513).

competitive compared to conventional energy sources, but this is not true. Some forms of solar
energy are already competitive; others can become so in a few years’ time. “Many people still
suppose that solar energy is something related to the future and wait for a technological discovery.
This supposition represents an error, as active and passive solar heating is present here and now as
an alternative to the conventinal sources of energy”, shows the Harvard Business School study
(Capra, 1979 in Stobaugh et al., 2004).
Other technologies with tremendous potential are the photovoltaic and wind generators,
which would bring about fundamental structural changes for the utilities industry. Today the major
obstacle to rapid development of new technologies is represented by the utilities companies that are
unwilling to give up their monopoly in the field of electricity production.
F. Capra states that the way towards a solar future is open and all that is necessary is accurate
public information about the solar energy potential, together with appropriate social and economic
policies, so as to facilitate the transition to the solar era. At the same time, the renowned
theoretician offers the example of Barry Commoner, a man who designed a detailed scenario for
replacing most of the unrenewable energy sources with solar energy on a 50-year timespan scale.
(Capra, 1979 in Commoner, 2004). His proposal neither entails major technological innovations,
nor does it depend on drastic measures of energy preservation. The key to the project is the role of
natural gas as main bridge fuel. The underlying idea is the increase of production, the extension of
the current natural gas distribution grid and, afterwards, the gradual replacing of natural gas with
methane from solar sources. In order to do so, methane-generating devices have to be built
whereever there is a sufficient amount of biomass available.
According to Commoner’s scheme, which, of course, is only one of the numerous possible
plans, the initial step of the transition would consist in putting up gas generators wherever it is
possible and building more extensive gas distribution grids for their supply. At the same time,
active and passive solar heating systems would expand and greater and greater amounts of solar
methane made out of biomass would be added to natural gas in the distribution grid. The use of
photovoltaic cells and wind generators would significantly increase in a few years’ time and the
total production of solar energy would gradually increase until reaching approximately 20% of the
total energy budget in 25 years’ time. At that stage, in the middle of the transition period, both
solar energy and natural gas put together would make up a little bit more than half of the total
energy budget of a state, which would make it possible to completely eliminate the reliance on
nuclear energy. In the second half of the transition, oil and coal needs would progressively
decrease down to zero and the natural gas production would fall to around half of the present-day

10% natural gas share could be cut out, but it would be important to maintain this source of energy
as a backup, in order to compensate for the irregularities brought about by climate fluctuations
(Capra, 2004, p. 520).
The main obstacles against the solar transition are not technical, but political. The transition
from nonrenewable to renewable resources forces oil companies to give up their dominant role in
the world economy and fundamentally alter their activities. One solution would be for most of the
oil companies to invest in innovative businesses, as many of them have already started. Certainly,
problems will arise in other industries, as solar transition generates conflicts between social and
private interests. In F. Capra's view, the soft energy path would obviously serve the interest of all
energy users, but a reasonable transition to the solar era would only be possible if we are able, as a
society, to put long-term social advantages above short-term personal gains.

2.3. Lester R. Brown

One of the best-known scientists in the world - Lester R. Brown - is the founder of the
Worldwatch Institute, and founder and president of the Earth Policy Institute. The Telegraph of
Calcutta refers to him as "the guru of the environmental movement", and the Washington Post
called him "one of the world's most influential thinkers."
With the help of the institute set up by him, he published yearly reports called: Global Issues
of Humankind – State of the World, translated into 35 languages and released at the same time in
different countries around the world. Through papers such as the one published in 2003 “Plan B,
Rescuing a Planet under Stress and a Civilization in Trouble”, considered by many specialists to be
of the same magnitude as the first Report to the Club of Rome in 1974, he warned the global
community about the major dangers humankind and nature are facing. In order to avoid the
destruction of the planet, Lester Brown comes up with the following proposals: setting up a budget
for the recovery of the planet through the UNO and its financial programs; using current techniques
for protecting and restoring the environment; promoting the recycling of raw materials, a process
which takes place naturally in the environment; a short stage for the transition from the use of fossil
fuels (oil, natural gas, coal) to the use of renewable resources (wind, biomass, hydrogen,
photovoltaic devices, tides).
Thus, setting up a new global economic model has become the great challenge of the century,
which has generated answers such as Brown’s B Plans (taking into account the fact that the so-

decline and, eventually, towards collapse).
Finally, a middle path which realistically integrates the requirements of a global economic
model and the ecological aspirations of the future generations is represented by the “society of
moderation” project. The essential problem is finding a balance between the existing natural
capacities and the needs (present and future) of the society. The human ecological footprint has
become so heavy that the planet is seriously affected. The rapacious character of the “consumer
society” is strongly denounced.
Both the exaggerated individual consumption model and its collective expression and the
western model which the societies of the emerging countries have drawn the conclusion they should
follow in order to develop are thus challenged. Extremes can never constitute a viable solution. We
can neither preach for a utopian economic de-growth, nor continue on the same path, believing that
adaptation will occur owing to the force of circumstances. On the contrary, tools must be identified
and promoted in order to allow a reduction in fossil energy consumption, in the material and
resource flows. We do not need to become a society of privation, but a society of moderation, and
in L. Brown’s opinion, we must do it quickly, as the world of tomorrow, whether we like it or not,
will be radically different from that of today.

3. CONCLUSIONS

People have long lived under the impression that progress is linear, that every day will bring
about a step forward. The only thing is that the current “market” logic fatally leads to the opposite
direction. However, a new logic can progressively be substituted to it. But, in order for that to be
possible, the foundations of the present society must be amended and the “philosophical stone”,
which would allow the conciliation between the maintenance of economic and social growth and
the good management of the environmental issues, must be found.
In an era of extremes, the middle path seems to be the most appropriate, as well as the most
feasible in approaching such an issue. Thus, the rational use of natural resources is the main mean
of achieving an efficient increase in production, which can be accomplished by saving the factors of
production in the process of extracting and processing them. Thus, technical and scientific progress
(the informational resource) and the use of human potential (the only abundant resource) become
the main tools for solving the contradictions between the continuous increase of social needs and
the limited possibilities that the environment provides.
