Background
Ensuring food security is one of the most pressing global development challenges
(Godfray et al. 2010; World Bank 2008). Food prices are an important aspect of food
security (Swinnen and Squicciarini 2012; Pinstrup-Andersen 2009) and especially for
the poor (Dawe and Timmer 2012). The 2008 food price crisis re-awakened interest in
the drivers of food prices and there is now a voluminous amount of literature on the
drivers and consequences of food price volatility (see for example Abbott et al. 2009;
Mitchell 2008; Ivanic and Martin 2008; Headey and Fan 2008; Kamgnia 2011; Ulimwengu
and Ramadan 2009).
The drivers of food prices have been variously reported as increased reliance on biofuels (Ajanovic 2011; Rosegrant 2008; Mitchell 2008), climate induced supply rigidities
in some major agricultural countries (Baffes et al. 2015; Fischer et al. 1995; Rosenzweig
and Parry 1994); and increasing demand pressure due to an expanding global population (Dyson 1996), among others. However, our understanding of the drivers of food
prices especially in the developing world is still limited.
In Uganda discussions have majorly concentrated on the consequences of the
high food prices (Benson et al. 2008; Matovu and Twimukye 2009; Ulimwengu and
Ramadan 2009). Only a scanty amount of literature has focused on the drivers of
food prices in Uganda (see for example Dillon and Barrett 2013; Haggblade and
Dewina 2010). This paper, therefore, contributes to a better understanding of the
drivers of food prices in Uganda. In particular, the paper offers novel insights into

the role of energy and climatic shocks in Ugandan food price processes using a formal approach and in a single empirical framework.
Uganda presents an interesting case study for the examination of the drivers of food
prices in developing agrarian economies. First, agriculture is the dominant sector but
majority of poor households are net buyers of food (Simler 2010; Benson et al. 2008).
Therefore food prices have important welfare effects for the people (Simler 2010;
Wodon and Zaman 2010; Ulimwengu and Ramadan 2009). Second, agricultural sector
is still predominantly dependant on the vagaries of the weather and therefore climatic
shocks are likely to play a major role in the performance of the agricultural sector
(Mwaura and Okoboi 2014) with implications for food prices. Third, historical trends
suggest that global food prices follow international oil prices with possible pass through
effects to domestic prices (Fig. 1).
Literature has identified three channels through which energy price shocks affect
food prices: first, energy prices affect the cost of farm inputs including inorganic
fertilizer and fuel for farm machinery (Gilbert 2010; Dillon and Barrett 2013); second,
the increased production of bio-fuels may have implications for food production and
prices due to reallocation of agricultural resources to fuel production (de Gorter et al.
2013; Dillon and Barrett 2013; Mitchell 2008; Rosegrant 2008); third, energy prices can
drive up transport costs, which in turn affect the costs of food transportation and distribution (Dillon and Barrett 2013; Gilbert 2010; Badiane and Shively 1998; Mitchell
2008; Benson et al. 2008).
Against this background, this paper investigates the drivers of food prices in Uganda,
highlighting the importance of climate and energy shocks. The unique feature of this
paper is threefold: first; we estimate three vector error correction models – two for the
food markets (domestic and external) and one for the energy sector; second we account
for climatic shocks and seasonality effects; third we examine these issues in a single
equation framework that exploits cointergration techniques and general-to-specific
modelling.
Results indicate that energy prices are important food price drivers in the long run.
In addition, temperature shocks have a bigger short run effects on food prices than

Fig. 1 The evolution of world and domestic food and energy rainfall shocks. Other important drivers of food prices include exchange rates, international food prices and demand factors. These findings contribute to a growing strand
of literature that offers deeper insights into the national level drivers of food prices.
The remainder of the paper is organised as follows: Section two presents the theoretical framework; section three presents the estimation strategy and data; section four
provides the results; finally section five concludes.

prices. Tradable foods are subject to international competition while non-tradable
foods are not. As such while the price of tradable food is determined in the international/regional market non-tradable food prices are determined in the domestic market. Both tradable and non-tradable food prices are affected by energy price shocks

In our model energy shocks affect the prices of both traded and non-traded food
prices through their effects on the prices of farm inputs and transportation costs.
The tradable food sector

The traded food prices are determined in the international market through the interfÃ

action of the exchange rate, (et), and the international food prices, pt ; assuming purchasing power parity (PPP), where Uganda is a price taker, such that,

We expect both international food prices and exchange rate depreciation to positively
affect the prices of traded food.
The non-traded food sector

The non-traded food prices are determined in the domestic food market through agricultural production and real national income. Following Mawejje and Lwanga (2015)

the price of non-traded food commodities P t

The Uganda Bureau of Statistics collects two types of food indices. The ‘food price
index’ (FOOD) is a composite index that includes both domestic and imported food
prices. The ‘food crop price index’ (FCROP) includes only the domestic non-traded and
perishable food prices. We used the non-traded food crop price index in the domestic
food price equation. Please see Appendix 5 for a detailed breakdown of the CPI and its
components.

Climate shocks

We identify climate shocks as the deviations of monthly temperature and rainfall realisations from their respective long term means (see for example Maystadt and Ecker

Estimation strategy and data
The vector error correction models

We develop three vector error correction models, as a first step, for the three markets
namely: the domestic food market, the external food market, and the energy market.
The estimated models take the general form:
0

Δxit ¼ π i þ αi βi xit−1 þ

Xk
j¼1

∅i Δxit−j þ εit

ð7Þ

Where; i = {1, 2, 3} represents the domestic food market, external food market, and
the energy market; xi are vectors of variables that are integrated either of order 1 order;
αi are the adjustment parameters, βi are matrices of long-run coefficients, ∅ i are the
0

short run coefficients, πi are vectors of constants. It then follows that αi βi xit−1 represent
the stationary error correction terms, which define the deviations from long run equilibrium in the markets.
We obtain the long run equilibrium relationships for the three markets following
the sequence below: 1) in the first step we estimate the vector auto regressive models
and obtain the optimal lag lengths. 2) The second step involves determining the num0

ber of co-integrating relationships in the long run matrices αi βi xit−1 following the
Johansen procedure. 3) The third step involves estimation of the unrestricted cointegrating relations in the vector error correction models (based on equation 7) and
tests of hypotheses (or imposition of implied restrictions) to determine the long run
equilibrium relationship. 4) The fourth step involves checking for model stability and
residual analysis to check for normality, autocorrelation and heteroskedasticity of the
residual process.

The single equation model

The food price model is estimated as a single equation that includes lagged vector error
correction terms from the external (traded) food market, domestic (non-traded) food
market, energy market, lagged climate anomalies, as well as monthly dummy variables
to control for seasonality in the food price processes. In addition, the model includes
all short run variables used in the vector error correction models up to their 12th lags.
The single equation error correction food price model, therefore, takes the form in
equation 8.

adjustment parameters.
In estimating the food price model in equation 8 above we followed the general-tospecific approach; starting with twelve lags in the full model, to arrive at a parsimonious
representation of the food price model for Uganda, where only the significant parameters
are retained.
The data

We use monthly data spanning a 12 year period (2000–2011) that gives rise to a fairly
long time series with 144 data points for each variable. The Uganda specific data were
obtained from the Bank of Uganda (BOU) and the Uganda Bureau of Statistics (UBOS),
and the international food price data was obtained from the Food and Agricultural
Organization of the United Nations (FAO). The FAO compiles a monthly international
food price index as a weighted average of meat, dairy, cereal, edible oils and sugar
prices. For purposes of this paper, we use the international cereal price index given that
cereals are the more traded food items for Uganda.
The Uganda Bureau of Statistics provides two food price indices: The Food crop price
index (FCROP) which includes the (non-traded) perishables such as stable foods, fruits
and vegetables and the food price index (FOOD) which is a combination of the (traded)
processed and the perishables food prices. Unfortunately the Bureau does not provide a
stand-alone price index for the traded food sector and we could not extract out the
traded component because we lacked the necessary information to do so. For this reason our results should be interpreted with caution. However, this shortcoming notwithstanding, we believe the results provide useful insights into the roles of the domestic
and external food markets in local food price processes.
Other variables used in the analysis include: nominal exchange rate (XRATE); international cereal price index (CEREAL), real output (GDP), rainfall (RAINAN) and
temperature (TEMPAN) anomalies, international oil prices (CRUDE) and domestic oil prices (AGO). Table 1 shows the descriptive statistics of the data. Where appropriate,
the data were transformed and presented in their natural logarithm forms. Transformed series are preceded with the letter “l”. Where applicable, all data is presented in
constant or real terms unless otherwise stated.
The climate data is generated as the averages of 13 weather stations in the following
areas: Makerere, Entebbe, Soroti, Namulonge, Kasese, Lira, Gulu, Kabale, Mbarara,
Masindi, Arua, Kitgum, and Jinja. These weather stations span all ecological zones in
Uganda.
The graphical data expositions are provided in Appendix 1. We tested for the presence of unit roots (Table 2) following the procedures provided by Phillips and Perron
(1988) hereafter P-P; and Dickey and Fuller (1979) hereafter D-F. Test results show that
rainfall and temperature shocks are stationary in levels i.e. I(0), while the rest of the
variables are stationary in first differences i.e. I(1).

Results and discussions
The external food market

The long run co-integrating external food market is expressed in equation 9, assuming
that domestic food prices adjust to exchange rate and movements in international food
prices:
lfood t ¼ β0 þ β1 lxratet þ β2 lcereal t þ εt

ð9Þ

Where lfood is the natural logarithm of the food price index; lxrate is the natural
logarithm of the nominal exchange rate, and lcereal is the natural logarithm of the
international cereal price index. The various lag selection criteria including the LR,
FPE, AIC, HQIC and SBIC indicate an optimal lag length of 2 as shown in Table 3.
The Johansen co-integration procedure (Table 4) does not reject the null hypothesis
of one cointegrating vector.
Cointegration analysis in the external food market shows that there is a long-run relationship between prices in the traded food sector, international food prices and nominal exchange rates. This relationship is expressed in Table 5.
Results from the external food market (Table 5) indicate that in the long run, a one
percentage depreciation of the nominal exchange rate results into a 1.6 % increase in
the food price index, and a one percent increase in international cereal price index

leads to a 0.2 increase in the food price index. Thus international pass-through from
international food prices is weaker. In addition, the error correction term indicates that
4 % of all deviations from equilbirum in the current month are corrected in the following month.
The LM test indicates no autocorrelation in the model residuals at two lags. However,
the Jacque-Bera test for normality rejects the null hypothesis of normality of the error
structure. The inverse roots of the characteristic polynomial indicate that the model is
stable given that all roots locate within the unit circle (Appendix 2).
The domestic food market

Following Mawejje and Lwanga (2015), we assume that non-traded food prices are determined in the domestic market through agricultural production (supply) and real
non-agricultural national income (demand). We interpolate quarterly data for agricultural production and real national income to arrive at the monthly series that we use in
the model. Domestic food prices would be driven by other inputs such as wages and inputs. However such data are not available given the extent of subsistence/informal
farming in Uganda (Gollin & Rogerson 2014) and the limited use of modern technologies (Kasirye 2013). The estimated vector error correction model for the agricultural
sector takes the form expressed in equation 10.

national output. The various lag selection criteria including the AIC and FPE indicate
an optimal lag length of 4 as shown in Table 6.
The Johansen co-integration procedure indicates the existence of one cointegrating
vector (Table 7) that explains the long-run equilibrium in the Uganda domestic food
market.
Cointegration analysis in the domestic food market confirms the existence of a longrun relationship between domestic food prices, real per capita GDP, and rainfall anomalies. This relationship is expressed in Table 8.
Results from the domestic food price model indicate that in the long run, a one percentage increase in real national output increases the domestic food crop price index
by 1.89 percentage points. In addition a one percentage increase in agricultural production reduces the food crop index by 0.49 percent. These results suggest that demand
pressures have a stronger effect on food crop prices than supply shocks. The error correction coefficient indicates that 21 % of all deviations in the domestic food market are
corrected within a month’s period.
The LM test fails to reject the null hypothesis of no autocorrelation indicating that
our model suffers no autocorrelation. The Jacque-Bera test for normality, which is a
joint test for skewness and kurtosis, rejects the null hypothesis of normality of the error
structure. This is not a cause for worry, however, given the large sample properties of
our estimation approach. The inverse roots of the characteristic polynomial indicate
that the model is stable seeing that all roots locate within the unit circle (Appendix 3).
The energy sector

Although Uganda discovered commercially viable oil resources in 2006 (Mawejje &
Bategeka 2013) the country is still heavily dependent on imported petroleum products
to meet its domestic energy demand (Lee 2013). Therefore shocks in the energy markets are channelled through international prices of oil products and the exchange rate.
We estimate the long run equilibrium in the domestic energy markets, using vector

ð11Þ

Where lago is the natural logarithm of domestic pump price for a litre of diesel;
lcrude is the natural logarithm of international price for a barrel of crude oil, and lxrate
is the natural logarithm of the nominal exchange rate. The various lag selection criteria
including the LR, FPE, and AIC indicate that the optimal lag length for the energy market is 2 as shown in Table 9.
The Johansen co-integration procedure as applied to the energy sector does not reject
the null hypothesis of one cointegrating vector (Table 10). We are therefore confident
that at least one cointegrating vector explaining the long-run equilibrium in the domestic agricultural sector exists.
Cointegration analysis in the energy market shows that there is a long-run relationship between domestic fuel prices, international prices, and nominal exchange rates.
This relationship is expressed in Table 11.
This model indicates that in the long run, a one percentage increase in international fuel
prices results into a 0.5 % increase in domestic fuel prices, and a one percent depreciation
of the nominal exchange rate leads to a 0.7 % increase in the domestic fuel prices. These
results suggest that exchange rate movements matter more for domestic fuel prices than
for international oil prices. The error correction term indicates that 25 % of all deviations
in the domestic energy markets are corrected in the following month.
The LM test indicates no autocorrelation in the model residuals at two lags. However,
the Jacque-Bera test for normality rejects the null hypothesis of normality of the error
structure. The inverse roots of the characteristic polynomial indicate that the model is
stable given that all roots locate within the unit circle (Appendix 4).

prices in Uganda. The adjustment coefficients for the domestic food and energy markets are -0.085 and -0.040 implying that 8.5 and 4.0 % of all disequilibrium in the domestic food market and energy sectors are corrected in the following month
respectively.
Results indicate significant food price inertia in the short run. Lagged food prices enters the short-run model with significant coefficients in the first, second, fifth and sixth
lags. The search for a parsimonious model rejected disequilibrium in the external food
sector as an important source of food inflation. This suggests that transmission of
world food prices to the domestic market is low and is consistent with, among others:
Baffes et al (2015); Benson et al (2008); and Minot (2011).
Results indicate that temperature shocks are more important predictors of food
prices than rainfall shocks in Uganda. Rainfall shocks were not significant and therefore
dropped from the parsimonious model. These results are consistent with earlier research that showed temperature shocks have more devastating effects on food consumption Lazzaroni and Bedi (2014) and economic growth (Alagidede et al 2014;
Lanzafame 2014).
The nominal exchange rate variable enters the food price model positively in the first
month suggesting quick adjustment of domestic food prices to exchange rate movements. A one percent depreciation of the nominal exchange rate increases the food
price index by 0.21 % within the first month.
The international food prices influence the domestic food prices in the short run.
The international cereal price index enters the short run food price model positively
and is significant in the fifth month. The coefficient of the fifth lag of international
cereal prices is 0.088 indicating that a one percent increase in international cereal
prices corroborates 0.088 % increase in the domestic food prices with a five month lag.
This confirms our earlier assertions that international food price movements are transmitted into the domestic food prices more slowly.

Further, results indicate that demand pressures, captured by real national income
positively affect food prices, and supply factors captured by total agricultural output depress food prices. The short run coefficients for national income and agricultural output are 0.640 and -0.168 respectively indicating that a one percentage point increase in
national income increases the food price index by 0.64 % and a one percent increase in
agricultural output depresses the food price index by 0.168 percentage points.
Domestic fuel prices enter the food price model positively and significant in the first
month. A one percent increase in the domestic fuel prices results in a 0.07 increase in
the food price index within one month. These results suggest that short run energy
movements are transmitted through to food prices.
Finally, the results highlight the importance of seasonal factors in the Uganda food
price processes. Taking the month of December as the reference period, the monthly
(seasonal) dummy variables are significant during the months of February, March, May,
June, July, and October.
After estimating the single equation model for food prices, we carried out some diagnostics tests to establish the suitability of the statistical properties of the model. Test
results (Table 13) indicate that the short run single equation model is well specified.

Conclusions and policy recommendations
Food prices are an important aspect of food security. Therefore, a deeper understanding of food security issues requires an in-depth understanding of the drivers of prices.
Uganda presents an interesting case for an in-depth understanding of food prices. Agriculture is the dominant sector but majority of poor households are net buyers of food.
This implies that food prices have important welfare effects for the people. However,
technology adoption in Ugandan agriculture is low and the sector is still predominantly
dependant on the vagaries of the weather. In addition, trends in the data suggest that
that food prices follow international oil prices with possible pass through effects to domestic prices

This paper set out to examine the importance of energy and climate shocks in
Uganda’s food price processes. The unique features of this paper are threefold: first,
we identified climate shocks and their implications for food prices. Second, we incorporated the complementary role of energy prices in food price processes. Third,
we examined these issues in a single equation model exploiting cointegration techniques
and general-to-specific methods. Results indicate that energy prices have a long
run cointegrating relationship with food prices. In addition, temperature shocks are
more important than rainfall shocks in explaining food price variability. However, international pass-through of international prices to domestic prices was shown to be limited.
These findings have important implications for policy in Uganda. In the short run,
policies geared towards mitigating the effects of weather variability, such as investment in small scale irrigation technologies, post harvest storage facilities, and drought
