INTRODUCTION
Assessing the state of an economy is a huge undertaking, and the complexity it entails is
on the scale of the nations measured. Problems can arise from the onset, as the method used
for analysing an economy can lead to very different results. One can analyse an economy with
regards to its output (GDP), which is the most popular method used today. Other methods
include checking for the inequalities in an economy, and then the Gini index would be used. A
more holistic approach, although far from perfect, would be to analyse the Human
Development Index for a given country, which takes into account the education, income and
health of the citizens. These could all be broadly described as economic indexes.
The world in which we live is far more complex though, and a simple analysis of the
output of an economy or the spending patterns of its citizens simply will not do justice. Given
the fact that one of the key problems humankind is facing at this moment is related to the
environment, concerns have been voiced with regard to the inability of many of aforementioned
indexes to accurately account for the loss in biodiversity, the negative effects of human-induced
global warming and pollutants, the changes in the natural hydrological cycle, etc. (e.g. Daly,
1992, 2005).
Following years of research, we now have some measures of these effects and,
accordingly, some aggregate indexes for the state of the environment in a given economy. These

include: the Index of Sustainable Economic Welfare (Daily & Cobb, 1989; Cobb et al., 1995)
and the Genuine Progress Indicator (UNDP, 1996). These are holistic indexes, on par with the
HDI, and are regarded as the next generation measurement tools for an economy, because they
reveal much more than the economic output of a country.
With regards to the environment, Rees and Wackernagel (1994) developed a
measurement for the environmental state of an economy called the environmental footprint*.
The strength of this index lies in the fact that it focuses on a single aspect, the environment,
eliminating the haphazard job of aggregating qualitatively different entities, while the results it
returns are meaningful and can be correlated with the information given by economical
indexes, say GDP.
1. METHODOLOGY & PRELIMINARY DATA
The ecological footprint index consists of two parts: the effective ecological footprint of
a community on the land it occupies, and the biocapacity of the land. The effective ecological
footprint of a community is the mark left on the land by the inhabitants (both sink and source
side†), as measured in global hectares‡. The biocapacity is the annual capacity of the land to
regenerate (both sink and source side), as measured also in global hectares. Therefore, if one
substracts the effective ecological footprint from the biocapacity, one can get a crude
measurement of the strain on the environment put by the inhabitants. There is room for
improvement (for example, the ecological footprint methodology does not account for the lifesupport and human health and welfare functions of the environment – see Ekins, 2003), but the
method has already been implemented by some Governments, in order to assess their impact
on the environment. For the EU, the following data could be accessed:

2. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
At a first glance, the results are somewhat grim: only 4 out of the 24 EU members for
which we could obtain data have a positive gross ecological footprint. We interpret this as
meaning that 4 countries out of the 24 studied states place a strain on their environment (source
and sink side wise) less than the regenerative capacities of the land occupied. Conversely, 20
countries were, for the year 2007, overshooting the pressure on their environment, by taking in
more resources than the land can regenerate, dumping more wastes than it can assimilate, or
both.
The ecological footprint concept depends on two components: the effective ecological
footprint of the given community and the biocapacity of the land to regenerate. Both of these
quantities, as measured in global hectares, can fluctuate yearly, which means that the figures in
the previous tables can vary from year to year. Given this fact, we can exclude one country that
is near unity (δ=1), because Lithuania, which scored a δ of 90.71% for 2007, can go above
100% the next year, due to either a drop in biocapacity (from natural or artificial causes), an
increase in the effective ecological footprint (due to increased human activity, for example), or
a concurrence of both these effects. By eliminating Lithuania, as an inconclusive case, we are
left with 23 countries.
Although we have only eliminated one country, the strongest message is conveyed by the
countries with δ values situated furthest from 1. These outliers tell us the most about the impact

of the economic growth on the environment. Before going into an analysis of those countries,
we should first clarify what δ=1 means. There is a growing body of literature (although not
from mainstream economics, and much of it coming from other fields, such as biology), which
suggests that ecosystems provide valuable (although weakly quantifiable) assets for humankind
(inter alia, Costanza & Daly, 1992; Vitousek, 1994; Chapin III et al., 1997; Costanza et al.,
1997; Myers, 1997; Daily et al., 2000; Balnavera et al., 2001; Heal, 2004;). These include
such functions as: complex and diverse genetic repository (through biodiversity), maintenance
of the hydrological cycle, maintenance of the carbon cycle, maintenance of the nitrogen cycle,
control over the climate, etc.
Focusing on just the biodiversity aspect, which has provided incommensurable assets in
the past, and will undoubtedly provide more in the future, it is clear that any patch of land that
has a δ value of 1 leaves little room for biodiversity to flourish. Much revenue is earned via
tourism, due to biodiversity; many pharmaceuticals are derived from compounds found in wild
flora or fauna. There is also a generally accepted theory in biology, which suggests that
ecosystem resilience is highly dependent on the diversity of its flora and fauna (Tilman &
Downing, 1994; Tilman et al., 1996; Tilman et al., 1997; Tilman et al., 2006). This places even
more value on biodiversity, due to the strengthening role it plays in the environment*.
These are all legitimate reasons not to discard the natural environment as a whole, when
assessing the health of an economy. The implications of our reasoning are that a δ value equal
to 1, while feasible strictly from the perspective of the human community, exhausts the source
functions, the sink functions, or both, of the given environment, therefore leaving little for the
local flora or fauna to thrive on. The inherent losses in biodiversity in such cases lead to a
lowered resilience for the ecosystem, which in turn boomerangs back to more losses in
biodiversity. Finally, due to the fact that biodiversity is tied in complex ways to the ecosystem,
this leads to a drop in the biocapacity of the land, therefore reducing the sink functions, the
source functions, or both (this effect can readily be seen in the impoverishment of the lands,
due to the modern usage of large scale monocultures).
The previous paragraphs add weight to an already alarming situation. Going back to the
analysis, we conclude that 10 of the 24 countries for which data was available, have overshot
the regenerative capacities of their appropriated land by a factor of at least 2; 7 of these

*Determining,

however, even a grosso modo value for the benefits accrued from ecosystems is a very difficult undertaking
(e.g. Costanza & Folke, 1997; Costanza 2000b; Heal 2000). For an attempt at measuring these benefits see Costanza et al.
(1997). For the uncertainty regarding such evaluations, see Arrow & Fisher (1974).

countries have surpassed the regenerative limit by a factor of 3; Spain, Greece, Italy,
Netherlands and Belgium have exceeded this limit by more than 4 times. In simple terms, in
order for these last 5 countries to be ecologically sustainable, at least with regards to the human
appropriation of the sink and source functions of the ecosystem, the lands they possess would
have to be 4 times larger in surface size*. Of the 3 remaining countries (those with a positive
ecological footprint - Lithuania was excluded from the analysis), only Finland is using less than
half the regenerative capacity of the land it possesses.
One might ask then, if so many countries are actually exceeding the carrying capacity of
the land they appropriate, how can their communities still thrive? Many of the countries with
a negative ecological footprint consist of highly developed economies, and would otherwise be
seen as models for societal and economic development. How can some of these countries fail
so hard at being ecologically friendly? The answer to this question is unclear, and the question
in itself could be the subject of an entire thesis. It is beyond the scope of this article to come up
with arguments supporting one side or the other. It is highly probable that the ecological
footprint correlates positively with the energy consumption in a economy (although one might
be right in pointing out that the energy intensity of a country is just as much a telling index as
the primary energy consumption, since it reveals much about the efficiency in using the said
energy), and also with the population density of that country†.
Clearly, there are other factors at work here, besides the ones mentioned, and some of
them might not even be of a physical and quantifiable nature. Psychological factors‡, culturally
induced behaviors, the impact of religion, traditions, etc., all might have a role in explaining
the ecological footprint of a given country, and many of these factors could be unique to the
given country, which would imply that making generalizations on the subject is a hazardous
enterprise. But if determining the causes clearly requires more research, in many fields of the
human knowledge, not just economics, the mechanism that sustains this process is clear: many
countries can afford to go beyond the regenerative limits of the lands they own, simply because
they are importing biocapacity. Many developed countries can afford to undergo long periods
characterised by a negative ecological footprint, because there are other countries which are in

*As

usual, the same assumption of an average productivity hectare is assumed.
Notice that in Figure 1, all the countries with either high population density or high energy consumption have similarly high
δ values. In the same figure, the dotted rectangle denotes the four countries with a positive gross ecological footprint value,
while the dotted elipse encompases countries with similar x/y/z values. The remaining outliers are countries with a high δ
value (>200).
‡For some interesting research in the field of environmental psychology, see inter alia, Proshansky et al. (1983); Hidalgo &
Hernandez (2001); Schultz (2002); Giuliani (2003); Mayer and Frantz (2004); Schultz et al. (2004).
effect creating carrying capacity and, at a global level, this helps lessen the environmental
impact. These countries rarely accrue benefits for this, although there are mechanisms which,
in time, will probably alleviate the problem (one such mechanism might be the Clean
Development Mechanism; for some promising results in this respect, see Castro et al., 2000).
Some examples include: developed countries that have destroyed much of their natural
biodiversity can still benefit from the genetic richness of flora and fauna found in less
developed countries, and in fact this is happening all the time, as researchers (generally located
in the highly developed countries) travel to less developed countries and, after years of
research, return with their fruits of labor and introduce pharmaceuticals and other products in
the global market. This would not be possible if less developed countries would have
appropriated much of the ecosystem functions, but nor would it be possible if the research
teams from the highly developed countries would be inexistent. Another example involves the
carbon cycle. Forests play a crucial role in this cycle, because, through photosynthesis, carbon
is fixated, and, in the process, oxygen is released (which is vital for humankind). The fact that
some countries have a negative ecological footprint could be indicative of a deficiency in the
carbon cycle (caused by deforestation). The carbon cycle is not however a local phenomenon,
which means that developed countries can afford this loss, as long as other countries,
knowingly or not, keep their forests pristine. This reasoning can be applied to most of the
contributions that an ecosystem has to human society. In a sense, the developed countries that
show a negative ecological footprint are owing their existence to borrowed carrying capacity,
imported from the less developed countries, and most of the time the latter receive only
moderate compensation for their services.
CONCLUSIONS
This article focused on the ecological problems that some EU members have, and the indicator
used was their ecological footprint. We analysed 24 of the 28 members, because information
on Cyprus, Malta, Luxembourg and Sweden could not be obtained. Given the particular
geography and population density of Cyprus, we could hypothesise a negative ecological
footprint, while Sweden would most likely have a positive ecological footprint, since it is one
of the least populated countries in the world, and has sprawling forests. Malta most likely is on
par with Cyprus, while for Luxembourg, we can only guess that it might follow the trend set
by the majority of EU members. This are all speculations, though. For the countries we have
had data, the following conclusions can be emphasised:


20 of the 24 analysed countries have overshot the regenerative capacities of their land,
for the year 2007. This means that, for that year, either the source functions of the
ecosystem have been surpassed, the sink functions have been exceeded, or both;



4 countries (Estonia, Finland, Latvia and Lithuania) returned a positive ecological
footprint, although one (Lithuania) remains inconclusive, due to the contiguity of the
values of ecological footprint of consumption (3.32) and biocapacity (3.66);



of the countries with a negative ecological footprint, 10 of the 24 have overshot the
regenerative capacities of the appropriated land by a factor of at least 2; 7 of these
countries have surpassed the regenerative limit by a factor of 3; Spain, Greece, Italy,
Netherlands and Belgium have exceeded this limit by more than 4 times;



Finland is the country with the lowest gross ecological footprint value, since, for 2007,
it had used the source and sink functions of the ecosystem up to less than a half of its
regenerative capacity;



all the countries with a negative gross ecological footprint value are ecologically
unsustainable, and their continued existence is due to the preservation of ecosystems in
mostly lesser developed countries. This situation is poorly addressed by the global
market,

as

some
