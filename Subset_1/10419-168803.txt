etc. (Gogoneaţă, 2010; National Environmental Protection Agency - NEPA, 2013).
Certainly, within the EU, sustainable development is subject to numerous summits, treaties
and agreements, the most important being the "Lisbon Treaty" in 2007 (NEPA, 2013).
Our country actively participated in these events and as a result, on 12 November 2008, the
Government approved the National Sustainable Development Strategy 2013-2020-2030
(Government of Romania, 2008).
If initially, sustainable development implied the conservation of current resources for future
generations (Gogoneaţă, 2010), the concept evolved and currently seeks balance between
three areas - ecology, society and economy. Based on these 3 poles - environmental, social
and economic - development respects environmental integrity, contributing to the wellbeing of individuals and societies based on economic performance achieved in this
framework. In other words, environment protection is a prerequisite, economic efficiency is
a means and social and individual development is an objective of sustainable development
(Gendron and Revéret, 2000).
Therefore, the business field suffers major changes due to its need to include sustainable
development objectives in each company strategy. Retailing, as a connection between
producers and consumers is an important link in the logistics chains. As such, it plays a
major role in influencing both producers and consumers, by raising awareness among them
about the principles of sustainable development (Jones et al., 2005; Erol et al., 2009, United
Nations Environment Programme - UNEP, 2011).
Sustainable development approach to retailing is the object of researches and studies
outlined in the academic literature. There are two angles to this approach. The first one
reveals the progress registered in retailing in applying sustainable development practices:
reducing energy and water consumption, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, the use of
clean technologies, waste recycling, green building design, selecting a healthy trading
range, employment of responsible human resources, etc. The second angle of approach
reflects the influences upstream, for raising the awareness of producers regarding the
principles of sustainable development, and downstream for raising consumer awareness
(Burger and Christen, 2010; Wiese et al., 2012; Kotzab et al, 2011; Witold and Zelner,
2010).
Also, a number of sustainable practices applied by retailers can be identified. Thus, the
main sustainable practices applied in retailing are: energy efficiency, recycling and reusing
products and packaging, reducing waste, reducing greenhouse gas emissions, using minimal
packaging, increasing the use of biodegradable packaging, of green energy sources,
implementing green procurement practices etc. (Delai and Takahashi, 2013).
In addition, sustainable development in retailing involves specific measures in human
resources-related to employee continuing education, skills development, improving
working conditions. This leads to versatility, hourly flexibility and increase of
responsibility.
In relation to producers, sustainable supply chains are developed, based on the extensive
application of the principles of sustainable development, control of supply, development of
green criteria in selecting suppliers, fair trade orientation etc. (Kotzab et al., 2011) .

sustainable development, which, in retailing covers the compliance of products, the
distribution efficiency, the reduction of distribution costs, service differentiation, improving
market image, etc.
Firms were forced to integrate sustainable development principles into their daily practices
and to present the impact and their contribution to sustainable development (Kolk et al.,
2010; Sharicz and Smith, 2011). The results of such pressures have resulted in the
proliferation of product codes, reporting guidelines, best practices, etc. (Robinson et al.,
2006).
Subsequent to the development of the strategy of sustainable development, Romania has
adopted numerous regulations relating to: general legislation for environmental protection,
packaging, electrical and electronic equipment waste, used tires, end of life vehicles,
batteries and accumulators, waste oils, waste transfer and transport etc. The statistics in
these areas are, however, carried out at national level without distinguishing between the
fields of activity. Thus, we can say that there are no data on the evolution of sustainable
development indicators in retailing firms, as well as in other sectors of the national
economy (ANMP, 2012).
Studies and researches in our country have revealed little impact of the implementation of
sustainable development policies and low awareness of its favourable impact on the
environment, society and economy (Olaru et al., 2010, Toma, 2011).
We propose in this article to highlight the status of the trade in Romania in relation to the
expansion of the presence of large international groups and the manifestation of the global
economic crisis. One aim of this research relates to measuring the effectiveness of the big
players in the field of activity in our country. Also, we consider the identification of
sustainable practices in the Romanian retailing companies.
1. Trends in retailing
Retailing market is globalized. Creating sources of competitive advantage is becoming
increasingly difficult. One success factor is the innovation. In the retailing industry,
innovation is manifested in the form of the shops, brand politics, commercial range, internal
processes, consumer experience, information technology, new communication and payment
tools, methods of order fulfilment, etc. (Reinartz et al., 2011)
As Eckhard Cordes stated - CEO of METRO Group, the retail sector suffered major
changes in recent years, citing the introduction of RFID technology at the operational level,
the increasingly wider awareness of environmental issues and climate change "and
revolutions occuring in retailing of emerging markets, particularly eastern Europe, China
and India" (Kraft and Mantrala, 2010, p V).
Cox and Brittain (2004), similar to Kotler and Armstrong (2001), analyse the trends in
retailing in a classical manner, mentioning the shift of consumption of goods towards
services (catering, holidays, financial services, etc.), the decrease of business units due to
competition from large commercial networks, the orientation of entrepreneurs towards
bigger and bigger retail shopping centres, with a wide range of products and services, the
polarization of retailing in that department stores are turning to the concept of "one - stop" ,
while the smaller retailers tend to specialize. Also, a tendency of concentration can be
trade groups, especially in the food trade area and a strong development of electronic
commerce, in particular due to the development of technology and its costs which are
getting lower.
Among European retail trends, Dawson (2010) noted that large commercial companies
(Wal-Mart, Carrefour, Tesco, Metro, etc.) "grow" faster than the rate of growth of the retail
sector, also noted a sharp strategic approach to management decisions, an organizational
structure becoming more complex due to the increase of the size of trade companies, and a
growth of the role of large retailers in coordinating the value chain, so that the value can be
obtained throughout the chain, not just at the final point of sale. It also noted the growing
trend of brands notoriety stores that are somewhat at the expense of branded products or
trademarks established.
It also needs to be observed the trend of growing notoriety of brands stores that are
somewhat at the expense of branded products or renowned trademarks.
Among the trends that can be observed in relation to the retailing industry in emerging
markets is "bullwhip effect" in the development of modern retail trade. This phenomenon is
enshrined in economics about supply chain management - delivery (Lee, Padmanabhan and
Whang, 1997; Lee, So and Tang, 2000; Balan, 2008) and describes the increased amplitude
of the demand as it moves from the end customer to the manufacturer. In the retailing case,
the bullwhip effect is generated by the very favourable response from consumers in
emerging markets to modern retail formats in the form of signals whose amplitude
increases as they reach major decision makers in the industry, land owners and commercial
and real estate brokers. The bullwhip effect materializes in an accumulation of commercial
spaces, which often prove inefficient due to high prices of acquisition or rental, seasoned
with an acute shortage of lands and commercial spaces. The supply chain role is played by
the external environment of the firm, defined through its essential aspects: demographic,
economic, natural (environment), technological, political and cultural (Kotler, 1997), and
the role of stocks of goods is taken by the number of retail business units sales,
respectively, the cumulative area of commercial premises.
2. Research methodology
In developing our approach we proceeded to the selection of 12 retail companies, this
selection defining a reference field. The selection criteria of ranked firms are related to
retail development as a main activity and a yearly turnover of more than a billion Ron.
Of the twelve companies present in the ranking, two are using cash & carry format, five are
using the hypermarket format, two are using the discount format and three are using the
supermarket format.
It is relevant to note that the company Carrefour Romania SA operates simultaneously by
25 hypermarkets and around 50 supermarkets, but given that official reports towards state
authorities do not distinguish according to the company in two formats and sales volumes is
provided predominantly by hypermarkets, we considered that the company operates
exclusively on the latter format.

represents less than 1% of the total number of companies in this sector. This is a conclusive
picture on the degree of concentration on this market.
For the study we used a descriptive research. This was determined by the nature of the
information that we wanted to achieve and by the need for specific tools for collecting the
relevant data.
Data collection was performed by the method of investigation of secondary sources:
 Publications of the Romanian institutions - the National Bank of Romania, National
Institute of Statistics, Ministry of Public Finance and others, and international institutions Eurostat , and the magazine Piața, relevant to the retail sector;
 Online research sites of the chosen companies.
Please note that the data collected about the 12 selected companies in the benchmark were
analyzed in their dynamic between 2007-2011, to provide a conclusive picture and avoid
difficulties related to the reporting period of the documents and their dissemination.

It can be seen that the average annual growth rate of turnover for the twelve selected
companies is 23.41%. The companies with the highest growth rates are Profi Rom Food
Ltd. (43.77% per year) - its turnover increased in the last five years over four times, Mega
Image Ltd. (38.13% per year) - its turnover increased in the last five years over three times,
and Kaufland Romania SCS (27.09% per year) - - its turnover more than doubled in the last
five years, propelling it from the third rank in 2007 to the first rank in 2011.

one between the years 2009 - 2011 to register a decrease in turnover, with an average
annual rate of 7.07%.
Even if they consider deflating the Consumer Price Index (CPI), the increased turnover
deflated is consistent. In Table no. 2 we can see that the turnover of selected companies
grow by an average annual rate of 17.83%. Besides the company METRO Cash & Carry
Ltd. which presented a decrease also in the previous case, there emerged two more firms
with turnover decrease: Romania Hypermarche SA (CORA) with 4.11% decrease per year
and Billa Romania Ltd., with 3.37% decrease per year.

The consistent growth in turnover of selected companies, with an annual average rate of
about 20% over the reference sector, cannot be explained solely by the increase of
economic performance, but also by the continued expansion of the firms. The expansion of
modern retail firms is reflected in the number of units, the total sales and number of
employees. In Table no. 3 is presented the top of the selected companies, calculated on the
average number of employees in 2011.
It can be seen that the average annual growth of turnover of firms in the top is accompanied
by a substantial increase in the number of employees, an average of 15.47% per year, which
confirms the growth hypothesis based on expansion mentioned above.
However, changes in the number of employees are very different from one firm to another:
Kaufland Romania SCS has doubled the number of employees, increasing it by about 5,000
employees during the years 2007-2011; Profi Rom Food SRL has increased more than four
times the number of employees between the years 2007 – 2011, and Selgros Cash & Carry
Ltd reduced its number of employees by approximately 15% in the same period.

Table no. 4 shows top main companies in the Romanian retail market, calculated according
to the total area sales in 2012. Values in the table are those at December 31 of each year.
In 2012, it can be seen a decrease of approximately 150,000 square feet in the REAL, Hypermarket Romania SRL company's portfolio, which are to be found in the Auchan
Romania SA company's portfolio. This is the result of a transaction finalised in 2012
between METRO Group, as owner, and Auchan Groupe, transaction through which, the
Real hypermarkets division from Eastern Europe is sold to the latter (METRO GROUP,
2012). Mega Image SRL can be also noted, with major annual average growth rate of total
area selling (43.92%) and Profi Rom Food SRL (32.66%) as well as Kaufland Romania
SCS with average annual growth of about 50,000 square meters.

4. Economic efficiency of main players in the Romanian retail market
Among the indicators considered relevant, presented in this chapter can be listed market
share, work productivity, productivity of the commercial area, rates of return, general
liquidity index, and general leverage rate and the inventory turnover. A component analysis
of the turnover, the economic rate of return and the commercial rate of return is shown in
the data sheets of public companies in order to detect elements that favoured the positive
developments to the detriment of those which favoured negative developments.
Table no. 6 presents the top of the first twelve Romanian trading companies by market
share in 2011, calculated by reporting to the reference market.
In 2011, the combined market share of the first twelve companies from the top is 46.09%,
while the market share of the first five companies in the top, in the same year is 31.56%.
The dynamics of the market shares of selected companies is also remarkable, Kaufland
Romania SCS doubling its market share in the period 2008 - 2011 and Profi Rom Food
SRL nearly tripling its market share in the same period.

quite natural, given the specific predominant selling of large lots, but also due to the fact
that this format is among the first companies that have entered the market in Romania.
The dynamics of labour productivity in the companies presented is insignificant (average
increase of 0.47% per year), but taken on each company has very different values. METRO
Cash & Carry Ltd, albeit registers a consistent decrease in productivity (average 8% per
year in the period 2009-2011) retains top position in this ranking. Auchan Romania ltd. in
the period between 2007 and 2011, recorded the highest average annual growth rate of
labor productivity (15.85%), while Romania Hypermarché ltd. has the highest average
annual rate of decline (11 , 61%).
It is notable that the productivity of firms in the ranking is twice higher than the average
national productivity and is comparable to that of Germany or the European Union, but
only half of that of France.

The highest value of the sales area productivity is obtained by Metro Cash & Carry Ltd.
(6.123 Euro / sq. m / year) due to its specific predominant selling of large batches and due
to the maturity of the market in Romania (as well as for labor productivity) and the lowest
sales area productivity is the company Lidl Discount Ltd. (2.929 Euro / sq. m / year), most
likely due to a strategy mainly oriented towards extension (perspective that can be observed
in the average annual growth of the total area of sales) and less towards efficiency.
Sales area productivity growth between the years 2010 - 2011 is negative (8% per year),
most likely due to the expansion of network stores (average annual growth rate of sales area
11.45%) coupled with a rebound of consumption due to deteriorating economic conditions,

rate (5.91%).
It is noted positively Profi Rom Food Ltd., with an average sales area productivity increase
of 14.87% per year, and negatively Romania Hypermarche SA with an average decrease
sales area productivity of 22.27% per year. Even in this situation, Romania Hypermarche
SA still holds an honourable second place in the top of the selected firms.
The values of the sales area productivity of main Romanian companies selected for this
study are comparable to those of the main companies in the retail market in Germany, as
shown in Table No. 9.

In 2011, from the point of view of commercial rate of return, expressed as the ratio between
net income and turnover, in Table no. 10 can be seen the top firms in the reference range.
Carrefour Romania Ltd. ranks first, with a commercial rate of return of 3.32%, while the
last position is occupied by Lidl Discount Ltd. with a negative commercial rate of return of
16.88%. Compared to the annual inflation rate, only Carrefour Romania SA has a higher
commercial rate of return, all other companies in the ranking being under the rate.
The negative dynamics of commercial rate of return can be attributed to the bullwhip effect
in the development of modern trade (average annual growth rate of sales area, 11.45% in
the period 2010 - 2012 - Table no. 4) in conjunction with rebound consumption due to the
deteriorating general economic climate.

Both the small average turnover and the low productivity per firm in Romania can be
attributed to the large number of companies reported in the reference range, although in the
period 2008 - 2010 the number decreased by an average of 9% per year.
5. Aspects of the sustainable development in major Romanian retail firms
From the very beginning it should be noted that, in Romania, there is no statistical data on
sustainable development indicators for the retailing trade. However, The National Institute
of Statistics developed "Statistical indicators of sustainable development "(INSSE, n.d.),
with components related to aspects of structural change and macroeconomic balances,
climate change and clean energy, sustainable transport, sustainable consumption and
production, etc. In spite of this, there are no separate data related to retailing. The same
situation can be seen in the case of the National Environmental Protection Agency, which
does not provide distinct data for the retail sector.
Therefore, we did a research of the sites of the Romanian retail companies retained in the
reference field. Of the 12 companies, only one, REWE ( Romania ) Ltd., operating the
chain Penny Market XXL, does not allow free access to the site, being required a
registration. As a consequence, our analysis was performed on the rest of the companies in
the reference range.
A first observation is that if the international groups they belong to have clear concerns on
the implementation of sustainable development policies, in Romania, only 6 companies are
interested in these issues: Kaufland Romania SCS , Selgros Cash & Carry Ltd, Real Hypermarket Romania ltd., Auchan Romania SA , Mega Image Ltd. and Billa Romania
Ltd.. This can be explained in several ways: lack of legislative pressure, the way in which
the retail market operates, the sources of competitiveness and low expectations of the

voluntary for purposes of image and social responsibility.
Of the six companies, only one, Auchan Romania SRL, develops a "Sustainability Report"
(Auchan, 2013), which briefly summarizes a number of courses of action and concerns
regarding sustainable development. Also, absolute data and specific reporting indicators are
not presented.
The other five companies state a number of concerns, actions and objectives related to
sustainable development, but these ones reach just certain parts of sustainable development.
Kaufland promotes “Commitment to people and the environment"(Kaufland, nd), made up
of three areas:
 Environmental protection - recycling, green technology, office materials
 Range - certified products, organic products, protection of forests and animals
 Society - environmental action, educational campaigns, healthy lifestyle
Selgros Cash & Carry promotes "Social responsibility" (Selgros, nd), stating a range of
charitable actions, educational ones, sponsorship of sports teams, environmental protection
- ecology, renovation.
Real Hypermarket has a recycling program in which the main activities carried out are
specified (Real Hypermarket, nd).
Mega Image has two components, namely "Factory for a clean future", with activities
related to green energy, recycling, partnerships, raising of awareness of suppliers towards
corporate responsibility and "Mega Image Fund for Community” focusing on social,
environmental and educational projects (Mega Image , nd).
Billa Romania mentions "social responsibility" with two components (Billa Romania, nd):
 Sustainability - bags, flyers, recycling, energy
 Social, charitable, environmental
In conclusion, we note a relatively low concern for the principles of sustainable
development in business firms in the reference range. Mainly, their activities relate to
corporate social responsibility and environmental protection. We find that human resources
are not included in the policy of sustainable development. Actions for raising awareness of
consumers and producers are sporadic. Finally, information on the studied sites are not
updated.
6. Discussions
From the data and analysis presented it can be concluded that the major players in modern
trade will keep on developing, on the one hand due to the erosion of market share relating
to traditional commerce, and on the other hand, due to the expanding number of
commercial business units, even if the development rhythm will be slowed amid
unfavorable economic context.
In order to integrate the principles of sustainable development policy in their own business,
retailers can adopt a series of measures aimed at finding out the environmental impact of
their activities, their influence on the behavior of members of supply chains and consumer
education.
is aimed at designing sustainable green buildings, implementation of energy and water
conservation, waste recycling, appropriate policies for recruitment, training and motivation
of the workforce etc. (Witold and Zelner , 2010).
Building sustainable supply chains turns out to be the right decision in terms of both
economic and competitiveness (Kotzab et al. , 2011). In this sense, a series of actions are
required, actions aimed at achieving: cooperation in developing of innovative products with
sustainable features, stimulation in the adoption of clean production techniques and
technologies, the use of sustainable criteria for selection of suppliers, development of active
partnerships with manufacturers and their inclusion in corporate social responsibility
programs, effective communication, etc. (UNEP , 2011) .
Consumer education is one aspect of sustainable development with favorable impact. In
such an approach, priority should be given to finding solutions to stimulate sustainable
consumption, to offer incentives for buying eco-friendly products, to offer advice on the
sustainable features of the products, on how to use and destroy them, etc. (Petregal Diaz ,
2006).
Conclusions
Romanian retail market is growing, but the growth rates are lower and lower. This growth
is mixed, based on both extensive development (opening new stores) and intensive
development (efficiency of the operation of sales areas). The tendency of sector
concentration continues, the number of firms being diminished, but the size of their
surfaces increasing.
The efficiency of the exploit of commercial areas is in the European average, but the value
of sales is given mainly by the level of prices (mark-up rates) and not by the quantity of
goods sold. The attractiveness of investments in this sector is given both by the absolute
size of the Romanian market, but also by the benefits of labour costs in our country (lower
than the European average).
Concerns for integrating the principles of sustainable development in the strategies of retail
firms are modest, aiming, notably, corporate social responsibility and environmental
protection. This latter aspect gets some attention due to legislative constraints, and due to
incentives granted by public authorities. In addition, the principles of sustainable
development are significant savings opportunities (energy, fuel, water, etc.). In parallel,
they constitute a challenge for policies of planning and territorial development employment, local supply, waste management etc.
There are several issues which limit our research of which may be listed:
 No account was taken of a very important factor influencing the evolution of the
turnover of firms in the ranking - the evolution of the number of stores, respectively of the
total area sell of the main players in the reference period of 2003-2012. This is due to the
difficulty to obtain statistics from reliable sources.
 The research area was restricted to twelve companies, the first in the ranking in the
relevant field, by the share they hold and the features they have.
 There are political factors which influence both national and international economic
level, that have not been taken into account and whose relevance has not been estimated.
should be mentioned:
 The speculative behaviour in the management of large players in the retail market, a
strategic plan without substance and the lack of attention paid to the impact of
macroeconomic factors have led to the failures evidenced by the closure of large
commercial establishments (Metro, Carrefour, Real) or even to the exit of Romania's
market of some of the major players (Tengelmann, SPAR, Interex - Groupement des
Mousquetaires-ITM Entreprises, Real, etc.).
 The latest national regulation regarding cash&carry type wholesale allows the sale to
both individuals and businesses within the same locations provided that the
”retail/wholesale price differentiation” is maintained thus aligning the national legislation
to the new trend represented by the warehouse club format (warehouse club or membership
