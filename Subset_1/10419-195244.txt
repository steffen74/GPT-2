The impact of pharmaceutical innovation on cancer
mortality in Mexico, 2003–2013
Frank R. Lichtenberg1,2

Received: 31 January 2017 / Revised: 26 June 2017 / Accepted: 26 September 2017 /
Cancer mortality has declined in Mexico during the last 2 decades. As shown in
Fig. 1, the age-standardized cancer mortality rate1 of males declined by 13%, and
that of females declined by 11%, between 1995 and 2014.2 The mortality rate, or
(unconditional) probability of death from cancer, depends to an important extent on
two variables: the probability of getting (being diagnosed with) cancer, and the
probability of dying from cancer, conditional on having been diagnosed with
cancer: prob(death) & prob(diagnosis) * prob(death|diagnosis).3 Therefore, the
decline in the mortality rate could be due to either a decline in cancer incidence4, a
decline in the probability of dying from cancer, conditional on having been
diagnosed with cancer (e.g., due to improved treatment), or both.
The Mexican cancer incidence rate declined by 13% (from 147.3 to 128.4)
between 2002 and 2008, although it increased 2% (from 128.4 to 131.5) between
2008 and 2012.5 Since the cancer incidence rate declined at least as rapidly as the
cancer mortality rate in recent years, the decline in cancer mortality could be
entirely due to declining cancer incidence. However, the measurement of cancer
incidence is subject to signiﬁcant potential errors. For example, a decline in cancer
surveillance or screening could lead to a decline in measured cancer incidence, even
when true incidence is not declining.
The previous studies (Lichtenberg 2014a, 2015, 2016a, b) have shown that
pharmaceutical innovation—the introduction and use of new cancer drugs—has
signiﬁcantly reduced cancer mortality in countries at a ‘‘very high’’ level of human
development (as deﬁned by the United Nations Development Programme6). In this
study, I will assess the impact that pharmaceutical innovation and cancer incidence
had on cancer mortality in Mexico, a country at a lower (but still ‘‘high’’) level of

An age-standardized rate (ASR) is a summary measure of the rate that a population would have if it had
a standard age structure. Standardization is necessary when comparing several populations that differ with
respect to age, because age has a powerful inﬂuence on the risk of cancer. The ASR is a weighted mean of
the age-speciﬁc rates; the weights are taken from population distribution of the standard population. The
most frequently used standard population is the World Standard Population. The calculated incidence or
mortality rate is then called age-standardized incidence or mortality rate (world). It is also expressed per
100,000. See http://globocan.iarc.fr/Pages/glossary.aspx#MORTALITY.

In addition, between 1998 and 2013, mean age at death from cancer also increased by 1.8 years, from
62.3 to 64.1. Source: author’s calculations based on WHO Mortality Database (World Health
Organization (2016b)).

This approximation assumes that the probability that someone who has never been diagnosed with
cancer dies from cancer is quite small. This is plausible, because the cancer mortality rate (the
unconditional probability of dying from cancer) is about half as great as the cancer incidence rate (the
probability of being diagnosed with cancer).

Incidence is the number of new cases arising in a given period in a speciﬁed population. This
information is collected routinely by cancer registries. It can be expressed as an absolute number of cases
per year or as a rate per 100,000 persons per year.

Source: OECD Health Statistics 2016 database. Data on incidence prior to 2002 are not available. The
decline in incidence may be due, in part, to a decline in cigarette smoking, a major risk factor for lung
cancer. Between 2002 and 2015, the fraction of the population aged 15 ? who are daily smokers declined
from 12.4 to 7.6%.

human development. As in the previous studies, a difference-in-difference research
design will be used: I will investigate whether the decline in mortality was greater
for cancer sites (breast, lung, colon, etc.) subject to more pharmaceutical innovation
and greater declines in incidence. As shown in Fig. 2, the rate of decline in the
mortality rate varied considerably across cancer sites. The mortality rate declined by
at least 34% for 3 cancer sites (cervix, stomach, and lung), but increased for 3 other
cancer sites (colon, ovary, and breast).
In Sect. 2, I will formulate an econometric model of cancer mortality. The data
sources used to estimate these models are described in Sect. 3. Empirical results are
presented in Sect. 4. Rough estimates of the number of life-years gained in 2013
from the reduction in cancer mortality attributable to pharmaceutical innovation,
and of the average cost-effectiveness (cost per life-year gained) of new cancer
drugs, are developed in Sect. 5. Sect. 6 provides a summary and conclusions.

2 Econometric model of cancer mortality
The basic model which I will use to assess the impact of pharmaceutical innovation
and cancer incidence on age-standardized cancer mortality rates in Mexico is:
MORTst ¼ bk CUM NCEs;tÀk þ c INCIDENCEs;tÀ1 þ as þ dt þ est ;

cancer at site s; dt = a ﬁxed effect for year t.
Inclusion of year and cancer-site ﬁxed effects controls for the overall decline in
cancer mortality and for stable between-cancer-site differences in mortality.
Negative and signiﬁcant estimates of bk in Eq. (1) would signify that cancer sites for
which there was more pharmaceutical innovation had larger declines in mortality,
controlling for changes in incidence.
Due to data limitations, the number of new chemical entities is the only cancersite-speciﬁc, time-varying, measure of medical innovation in Eq. (1). Both a
patient-level US study and a longitudinal country-level study have shown that
controlling for numerous other potential determinants of mortality does not reduce,
and may even increase, the estimated effect of pharmaceutical innovation. The
study based on patient-level data (Lichtenberg 2013) found that controlling for race,
education, family income, insurance coverage, Census region, BMI, smoking, the
mean year the person started taking his or her medications, and over 100 medical
conditions had virtually no effect on the estimate of the effect of pharmaceutical
innovation (the change in drug vintage) on life expectancy. The study based on
longitudinal country-level data (Lichtenberg 2014b) found that controlling for ten
health expenditure (public and private), the DPT immunization rate among children
ages 12–23 months, HIV prevalence, and tuberculosis incidence] increased the
coefﬁcient on pharmaceutical innovation by about 32%.
Failure to control for non-pharmaceutical medical innovation (e.g., innovation in
diagnostic imaging, surgical procedures, and medical devices) is also unlikely to
bias estimates of the effect of pharmaceutical innovation on premature mortality, for
two reasons. First, more than half of US funding for biomedical research came from
pharmaceutical and biotechnology ﬁrms (Dorsey et al. 2010). Much of the rest came
from the federal government (i.e., the NIH), and new drugs often build on upstream
government research (Sampat and Lichtenberg 2011). The National Cancer Institute
(2016a, b) says that it ‘‘has played an active role in the development of drugs for
cancer treatment for 50 years… [and] that approximately one half of the
chemotherapeutic drugs currently used by oncologists for cancer treatment were
discovered and/or developed’’ at the National Cancer Institute. Second, the previous
research based on US data (Lichtenberg 2014a, c) indicates that non-pharmaceutical
medical innovation is not positively correlated across diseases with pharmaceutical
innovation. However, while non-pharmaceutical medical innovation may not be
correlated with pharmaceutical innovation across diseases in the US, this need not
hold for Mexico.
The measure of pharmaceutical innovation in Eq. (1)—the number of chemical
substances previously registered to treat cancer at site s—is not the theoretically
ideal measure. Mortality is presumably more strongly related to the drugs actually
used to treat cancer than it is to the drugs that could be used to treat cancer. A
preferable measure is the mean vintage of drugs used to treat cancer at site s in year
P
P
t, deﬁned as VINTAGEst = d Qdst LAUNCH_YEARd/ d Qdst, where Qdst = the
quantity of drug d used to treat cancer at site s in year t, and LAUNCH_YEARd = the world launch year of drug d.7 Unfortunately, measurement of VINTAGEst is
infeasible: even though data on the total quantity of each drug in each year (Qd.t = Rs
Qdst) are available, many drugs are used to treat multiple diseases. There is no way
to determine the quantity of drug d used to treat cancer at site s in year t.8 However,
Lichtenberg (2014c) showed that in France, there is a highly signiﬁcant positive
correlation across drug classes between changes in the (quantity-weighted) vintage
of drugs and changes in the number of chemical substances previously registered
within the drug class.

According to the Merriam Webster dictionary, one deﬁnition of vintage is ‘‘a period of origin or
manufacture (e.g., a piano of 1845 vintage)’’. http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/vintage.
Solow (1960) introduced the concept of vintage into economic analysis. Solow’s basic idea was that
technical progress is ‘‘built into’’ machines and other goods and that this must be taken into account when
making empirical measurements of their roles in production. This was one of the contributions to the
theory of economic growth that the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences cited when it awarded Solow
the 1987 Alfred Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences (Nobelprize.org 2016).

Outpatient prescription drug claims usually do not show the indication of the drug prescribed. Claims
for drugs administered by doctors and nurses (e.g., chemotherapy) often show the indication of the drug,
‘world launch’ of cancer drugs and their ‘Mexico launch’.9 According to Solow’s
vintage hypothesis, later, vintage goods (e.g., drugs whose world launch years were
later) are likely to be of higher quality than earlier vintage goods. Holding constant
the Mexican launch year of a drug, the shorter the lag from world launch year to
Mexican launch year, the later the world launch year of the drug, and (according to
the vintage hypothesis), the higher the drug’s quality. However, controlling for the
length of time between the ‘world launch’ of cancer drugs and their ‘Mexico launch’
is problematic. I can compute the mean lag between the world launch year and the
Mexican launch year for cancer sites and years in which at least one drug had been
launched in Mexico. However, I cannot compute the mean lag for cancer sites and
years in which no drugs had been launched in Mexico. As shown in Table 2, 8
cancer sites had 0 drug launches by 1995; 4 cancer sites had 0 drugs launches by
2004. Controlling for the length of time between the ‘world launch’ of cancer drugs
and their ‘Mexico launch’ would require excluding those observations.
In Eq. (1), mortality from cancer at site s in year t depends on the number of new
chemical entities (drugs) to treat cancer at site s that had been launched in Mexico
by the end of year t - k, i.e., there is a lag of k years. Equation (1) will be estimated
for different values of k: k = 0, 3, 6,…,18. A separate model is estimated for each
value of k, rather than including multiple values (CUM_NCEs,t, CUM_NCEs,t-3,
CUM_NCEs,t-6,…) in a single model, because CUM_NCE is highly serially
correlated (by construction), which would result in extremely high multicollinearity
if multiple values were included. One would expect there to be a substantial lag,
because new drugs diffuse gradually—they will not be used widely until years after
registration. Data from the IMS Health MIDAS database can be used to provide
evidence about the process of diffusion of new medicines. I used data from that
source linked to data on Mexican drug launch dates (described below) to estimate
the following model:
À
Á
ln N RXdy ¼ qd þ py þ edy ;
ð2Þ
where N_RXdy= the number of standard units of cancer drug d sold in Mexico per
thousand population y years after it was launched (y = 0–3, 4–7, 8–11, 12–15,
16–19 years); qd = a À
ﬁxed effect for drug d; py = a ﬁxed effect for age y.
Á
The expression exp py À p16À19 is a ‘‘relative utilization index’’: it is the mean
ratio of the annual number of standard units of a cancer drug sold per thousand
population y years after it was ﬁrst launched in Mexico to the annual number of
standard units of the same drug sold per thousand population 16–19 years after it
was ﬁrst launched in Mexico.
Using annual data on the number of standard units of cancer drugs sold in Mexico
during the period 1999–2010, I estimated Eq. (2). Estimates of the ‘‘relative
utilization index’’ are shown in Fig. 3. These estimates indicate that utilization of a
drug is strongly positively related to how long the drug has been on the market. On
average, a drug is used 50 times as often per year 16–19 years post-launch as it is

Number of years since launch

Fig. 3 Relative utilization of cancer drugs in Mexico, by number of years since launch (index: ratio of
utilization y years since launch to utilization 16–19 years since launch)

0–3 year post-launch. Utilization appears to rise especially rapidly after year 11,
when drug patents tend to expire and generics enter the market.
The effect of a drug’s launch on mortality is likely to depend on both the quality
and the quantity of the drug. Indeed, it is likely to depend on the interaction between
quality and quantity: a quality improvement will have a greater impact on mortality
if drug utilization (quantity) is high. Although newer drugs tend to be of higher
quality than older drugs (see Lichtenberg 2014d), the relative quantity of very new
drugs is quite low, so the impact on mortality of very new drugs is lower than the
impact of older drugs.
In principle, mortality in year t should depend on a distributed lag of incidence,
i.e., on INCIDENCEs,t, INCIDENCEs,t-1, INCIDENCEs,t-2, INCIDENCEs,t-3…
Unfortunately, data on incidence by cancer site are available for only 2 years (2002
and 2012); this is why INCIDENCEs,t-2 is the only incidence variable included in
Eq. (1). The limited availability of incidence data also means that we can only use
mortality data for 2 years (2004 and 2014). Writing the model for each of these
years:
MORTs;2003 ¼ bk CUM NCEs;2003Àk þ cINCIDENCEs;2002 þ as þ d2003 þ es;2003 ;
ð3Þ
MORTs;2013 ¼ bk CUM NCEs;2013Àk þ c INCIDENCEs;2012 þ as þ d2013 þ es;2013 :

Á
þ c INCIDENCEs;2012 À INCIDENCEs;2002
þ ðd2013 À d2003 Þ þ ðes;2013 À es;2003 Þ:
ð5Þ
Equation (5) may be rewritten as follows:
DMORTs ¼ bk DCUM NCE ks
þ c DINCIDENCE 1s þ d0 þ e0s ;

ð6Þ

where DMORTs = MORTs,2013 - MORTs,2003 = the 2003–2013 change in the
age-standardized mortality rate from cancer at site s; DCUM_NCE_ks =
CUM_NCEs,2013k - CUM_NCEs,2003-k = the number of drugs for cancer at site
s launched between year 2003 - k and 2013 - k; DINCIDENCE_1s =
INCIDENCEs,2012 - INCIDENCEs,2002 = the 2002–2012 change in the age-standardized incidence rate of cancer at site s; d0 = d2013 - d2003.
Equation (6) indicates that the 2003–2013 change in the age-standardized mortality
rate depends on two variables: the number of drugs launched between year 2003 - k
and 2013 - k, and the 2002–2012 change in the age-standardized incidence rate.
For estimates of bk from Eqs. (1) and (6) to be consistent estimates of the effect
of drug launches on mortality, the ‘‘parallel trends’’ assumption needs to be
satisﬁed. A simple way to test the validity of this assumption is to estimate a version
of Eq. (6) that includes a control for the trend in mortality in the ‘pre-period’, e.g.,
the period 1993–2003. Therefore, I will estimate the following model:
DMORTs ¼ bk DCUM NCE ks þ c DINCIDENCE 1s
þ p DMORT PREs þ d0 þ e0s ;

ð7Þ

where DMORT_PREs = MORTs,2003 - MORTs,1993 = the 1993–2003 change in
the age-standardized mortality rate from cancer at site s.

3 Data sources
Age-standardized cancer mortality rate data were obtained from the WHO Cancer
Mortality database (World Health Organization (2016a)).
Age-standardized cancer incidence rate data were obtained from GLOBOCAN
International Agency for Research on Cancer (2016). Mortality and incidence data
are reported separately by sex. For cancers affecting both sexes, we computed the
simple mean of the sex-speciﬁc rates. For cancers affecting only one sex (breast,
cervical, ovarian, and prostate), we computed 50% of the single-sex rate.
Data on drugs approved for different types of cancer were obtained from the US
National Cancer Institute.
Data on Mexican launch dates of drugs were obtained from the IMS Health New
in the IMS New Product Focus database) is usually the year in which the drug was ﬁrst
sold in Mexico (as indicated in the IMS MIDAS database). In a few cases, the drug was
ﬁrst sold in Mexico in the year after the Mexican launch year. I deﬁne CUM_NCEst as
the number of post-1981 new chemical entities (i.e., NCEs ﬁrst launched anywhere in
the world after 1981) used to treat cancer at site s that had been launched in Mexico by
the end of year t. Since the New Product Focus data are left-censored (no pre-1982
data), this measure is subject to error, because CUM_NCEst will not (but should)
include pre-1982 NCEs that were ﬁrst launched in Mexico after 1981. If this
measurement error is random, it is likely to bias estimates of bk towards zero.
Annual data on the number of standard units of cancer drugs sold in Mexico
during the period 1999–2010 were obtained from the IMS Health MIDAS database.
Data on age-standardized mortality and incidence rates, by cancer site and year,
are shown in Table 1.
Data on the number of post-1981 drugs ever launched in Mexico, by cancer site
and year, are shown in Table 2.
Mexican launch dates of drugs used to treat different types of cancer are shown in
Appendix Table 5.

4 Empirical results
Estimates of the pharmaceutical innovation (bk) parameters of the cancer mortality
rate model (Eq. (1) for different values of k are shown in Table 3. Each estimate is
from a separate model. For simplicity, estimates of the incidence coefﬁcient (c) are
not shown here. Estimates of the incidence coefﬁcient were positive and signiﬁcant
(and virtually identical) in all models, indicating that mortality declined more for
cancer sites that had larger declines in incidence.
The ﬁrst seven rows of Table 3 show estimates based on mortality and incidence
data for both sexes combined. Row 1 shows the estimate of b0, i.e., of the
pharmaceutical innovation coefﬁcient when there is no lag between the number of
drugs ever launched and the mortality rate. The estimate of b0 is negative but only
marginally statistically signiﬁcant (p = 0.07). This is not surprising, since, as shown
in Fig. 3, utilization of recently launched drugs tends to be quite low.
Row 2 shows the estimate of b3, i.e., of the pharmaceutical innovation coefﬁcient
when there is a 3-year lag between the number of drugs ever launched and the mortality
rate. The estimate of b3 is negative and statistically signiﬁcant (p = 0.03). Rows 3–7 of
Table 3 show estimates of bk for k = 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18, respectively. All ﬁve bk
estimates are negative and statistically signiﬁcant (p B 0.031). These estimates signify
that the mortality rate is inversely related to the number of drugs that had ever been
launched 3–18 years earlier, controlling for the incidence rate.10 The estimates of bk
based on data for both sexes combined are plotted in Panel A of Fig. 4.
10

Controlling for incidence is important. If DINCIDENCE_2s is excluded from the model, none of the bk
parameter estimates are statistically signiﬁcant. DCUM_NCE_k and DINCIDENCE_2 are positively
correlated across cancer sites—there were more drug launches for cancer sites that had larger increases in

To calculate the change in the mean mortality rate attributable to pharmaceutical
innovation, we can multiply the estimate of bk (column 1 of Table 3) by the mean
value of DCUM_NCE_k (column 5); the result is shown in column 6. These
calculations imply that new drugs launched during the period 1991–2001 had the
largest (most negative) effect on the 2003–2011 change in mortality. Henceforth, I
will focus on the estimates of the model when k = 12.
The two explanatory variables (DCUM_NCE_12 and DINCIDENCE_1) in the
mortality change (DMORT) model jointly explain 77% of the variance across
cancer sites in the 2003–2013 change in the mortality rate. The mean mortality rate
declined by 0.47 between 2003 and 2013. The estimates imply that new drugs
launched during 1991–2001 reduced the mean mortality rate by 0.47. The mean
mortality rate in 2003 was 2.99, so this indicates that new drugs launched during
1998–2008 reduced the mean mortality rate by 16% (= 0.47/2.99), i.e., at an average
annual rate of about 1.6%. The decline in incidence also reduced the mean mortality
as ? dt ? est for different values of k

Estimates in bold are statistically signiﬁcant (p-value \ .05)

also indicate that if no new drugs had been launched during 1991–2001 and the
incidence rate had not declined between 2002 and 2012, the mortality rate would
have increased by 0.28 between 2003 and 2013, although the estimated increase (the
intercept) is not statistically signiﬁcant.
Rows 8–14 of Table 3 show estimates based on mortality and incidence data for

Fig. 4 Estimates of bk parameters of Eq. (1), MORTst = bk CUM_NCEs, t-k ? c INCIDENCEs, t-1 ? as
? dt ? est for different values of k. a Both sexes, b females, c males

Rows 15–21 of Table 3 show estimates based on mortality and incidence data for
males only. The estimates are not statistically signiﬁcant when k B 9, but all three
estimates for k C 12 are negative and statistically signiﬁcant. These estimates are
plotted in Panel C of Fig. 4. The difference between the effects of pharmaceutical
innovation on female and male cancer mortality rates is not statistically signiﬁcant.
For example, the p value on the difference between the female and male estimates
of b12 in Table 3 (0.0972 = - 0.2218 to (- 0.3191)) is 0.51 (Chi-square = 0.44).
Launching of new drugs in Mexico may not be strictly exogenous with respect to
instrument that I used for CUM_NCEs,t-k (the number of drugs to treat cancer at site
s that had been launched in Mexico by the end of year t-k) is
CUM_NCE_FOREIGNs,t-k (the number of drugs to treat cancer at site s that had
been launched outside of Mexico by the end of year t-k), deﬁned as follows:
P
CUM_NCE_FOREIGNs,t-k = d INDds LAUNCHED_FOREIGNd,t-k = the number of new chemical entities (drugs) to treat cancer at site s that had been launched
outside of Mexico by the end of year t-k (k = 0, 3, 6,…,18):LAUNCHED
FOREIGNd;tÀk ¼ 1 if drug d had been launched outside of Mexico by the end
of year t À k¼ 0 if drug d had not been launched outside of Mexico by the end
of year t À k:
The ﬁrst stage of the two-stage IV estimation procedure is to estimate the
following equation:
CUM NCEs;tÀk ¼ X CUM NCE FOREIGNs;tÀk þ as þ dt þ est :

ð8Þ

CUM_NCE_FOREIGNs,t-k is a good instrument for CUM_NCEs,t-k: when
k = 12, the estimate of X is 0.8368 (Z = 6.24; p \ 0.0001). The second stage is to
estimate Eq. (1), replacing the actual value of CUM_NCEs,t-k by its predicted value
from Eq. (8). The IV estimate of b12 for both sexes (IV estimate = 0.2329;
Z = 4.06; p \ 0.0001) is very similar to the OLS estimate shown in row 5 of
Table 3.
As discussed earlier, the ‘‘parallel trends’’ assumption needs to be satisﬁed for the
estimates in Table 3 and Fig. 4 to be consistent estimates of the effect of drug
launches on mortality. To provide evidence about the validity of this assumption, in
Table 4, I present estimates of Eq. (7), which includes a control for the trend in
mortality in the ‘pre-period’, e.g., the period 1993–2003. These estimates are based
on a smaller set of cancer sites, because, as shown in Table 1, data on agestandardized mortality rates are less complete in 1993 than they are in 2003 and
2013. Rows 22–28 of Table 4 show estimates of Eq. (7) based on data for both
sexes combined for this smaller set of cancer sites when the trend in mortality in the
‘pre-period’ (1993–2003) is excluded from the equation. Rows 29–35 show
estimates of Eq. (7) based on the same sample when the trend in mortality in the
‘pre-period’ is included in the equation. The coefﬁcient (p) on the pre-period
mortality trend is signiﬁcant (and positive) only when k C 15. Controlling for the
pre-period mortality trend does not substantially change the estimates of bk. The
2003–2013 change in the age-standardized mortality rate is inversely related to the
change in the number of drugs ever launched 12–18 years earlier, controlling for the
2002–2012 change in incidence and the ‘pre-period’ (1993–2003) change in the
mortality rate.
The relationship across cancer sites between the number of new drugs launched
during 1985–1995 and the 2003–2013 change in the mortality rate, controlling for
the ‘‘pre-period’’ (1993–2003) change in the mortality rate and the 2002–2012
change in the incidence rate, is shown in Fig. 5; this chart corresponds to the
estimate of b18 shown in row 35 of Table 4. The ﬁgure indicates that the three

and the 2003–2013 change in the mortality rate, controlling for the 1993–2003 change in the mortality
2002–2012 change in the incidence rate and the trend in mortality in the preperiod. Excluding these three cancer sites from the sample does not have much
effect on the estimate of b18; when they are excluded, the estimate of b18 is - 0.357
(t = 8.15; p = 0.0039).

5 Discussion
The estimates indicate that the launch of new drugs subsequently reduced cancer
mortality. New drugs launched during 1991–2001 are estimated to have reduced the
age-standardized cancer mortality rate by 16%, i.e., at an average annual rate of
about 1.6%.
Now, I will develop a rough estimate of the number of life-years gained in 2013
from the reduction in cancer mortality attributable to pharmaceutical innovation, and
of the average cost-effectiveness (cost per life-year gained) of new cancer drugs.
To do this, I will estimate the decline in the premature mortality rate
attributable to pharmaceutical innovation. The premature mortality rate is the
number of potential years of life lost (PYLL) per 100,000 population (OECD
2017a, b). PYLL is a summary measure of premature mortality that provides an
explicit way of weighting deaths occurring at younger ages. The calculation of
PYLL involves summing up deaths occurring at each age and multiplying this with
the number of remaining years to live up to a selected age limit.11 The limit of
70 years was chosen for the calculations in OECD Health Statistics. To assure
cross-country and trend comparison, the PYLL are standardized, for each country
and each year. The total OECD population in 2010 is taken as the reference
population for age standardization.
As shown in Table 1, between 2003 and 2013, the age-standardized mortality rate for
all cancers combined declined by 15%, from 73.0 to 62.3. The estimates in Table 4
imply that virtually, this entire decline was due to the previous launches of new cancer
drugs. During the same period, according to the OECD, the premature cancer mortality
rate (the number of PYLL before age 70/100,000 population below age 70) declined by
11.4%, from 782.4 to 693.4. It seems reasonable to assume that this entire decline was
also due to the previous launches of new cancer drugs. Therefore, in the absence of the
previous new drug launches, premature cancer mortality would have been 12.8% (= (1/
(1 - 0.114)) - 1) higher in 2013 than it actually was. Actual PYLL before age 70 due
to cancer in 2013 was 823,209 (= 693.4 * (118,720,632/100,000)). I estimate that in the
absence of previous new drug launches, premature cancer mortality would have been
928,870 (= 112.8% * 823,209).
This calculation implies that 105,661 life-years before age 70 were gained in
2013 due to new cancer drugs. This is a rough estimate of the longevity beneﬁt in
2013 to people under 70 of cancer drugs launched during the period 1991–2001. To
calculate the average cost-effectiveness of these drugs, I would like to measure
11
This measure incorporates both the reduction in the number of deaths and the increase in mean age at
during the period 1991–2001. Unfortunately, these data are not available. However,
I do have unpublished data from the IMS Health MIDAS database on expenditure
(by or on behalf of all patients) by drug in 2010. Expenditure in 2010 on cancer
drugs launched during 1991–2001 was $315 million.12 72% of people diagnosed
with cancer in 2012 were below age 70 (source: GLOBOCAN). Expenditure in
2010 by or on behalf of people below age 70 on cancer drugs launched during
1994–2004 may, therefore, have been $227 million (= 72% * $315 million).
These calculations imply that the cost per life-year gained by people below age
70 from new cancer drugs was in the neighborhood of $2146 (= $227 million/
105,661 life-years). This ﬁgure may be somewhat underestimated, since it is based
on 2010 expenditure data.13 On the other hand, Lichtenberg (2014a) showed that in
the US, about 25% of the cost of new drugs (for all diseases) tends to be offset by
reduced expenditure on old drugs, so the cost per life-year gained may have been
below $2000.
The World Health Organization considers interventions whose cost per qualityadjusted life-year (QALY) gained is less than per capita GDP to be ‘‘very costeffective’’ (Bertram et al. 2016); Mexico’s per capita GDP in 2011 was $10,307.14
The estimated cost per life-year gained from the previous pharmaceutical innovation
is also well below the vast majority of estimates from the value-of-life literature of
the value of a life-year (see Hirth et al. 2000).

6 Summary and conclusions
I assessed the impact that pharmaceutical innovation had on cancer mortality in
Mexico during the period 2003–2013, by investigating whether there were larger
declines in mortality for cancer sites (breast, lung, colon, etc.) that were subject to
more pharmaceutical innovation, controlling for changes in cancer incidence. New
drugs launched during 1991–2001 are estimated to have reduced the agestandardized cancer mortality rate by 16%, i.e., at an average annual rate of about
1.6%. I estimated that 105,661 life-years before age 70 were gained in 2013 due to
cancer drugs launched during 1997–2007, and that the cost per life-year gained was
in the neighborhood of $2146. By the standards of the World Health Organization,
new cancer drugs have been very cost-effective in Mexico.
The contribution of cancer drug innovation to Mexican longevity growth has
been valuable, but, perhaps, it could have been even larger. According to the IMS
Institute for Healthcare Informatics (2016), during the period 2010–2014, 49 new
cancer medicines were launched worldwide. As shown in Fig. 6, about twice as

Expenditure in 2010 on all post-1981 cancer drugs was $393 million. This represents 2.4% of total
2010 pharmaceutical expenditure ($16.6 billion of US dollars at exchange rate) reported in MIDAS. The
OECD estimate of total pharmaceutical sales in 2010 is 24% higher: $20.6 billion.
13
According to the OECD, between 2010 and 2013, total pharmaceutical sales (in US$ at exchange rate)
increased 3.6% (from $20.6 billion to $21.3 billion).

Fig. 6 Number of 2010–2014 cancer medicines that have been launched in various regions

many of these have been launched in the US as have been launched in Mexico.15 In
addition, as shown in Fig. 3, when new drugs are launched in Mexico, their
diffusion is quite slow.
Due to unavailability of data, this study is subject to several limitations. The
measure of pharmaceutical innovation—the number of chemical substances
previously launched to treat cancer—is not the theoretically ideal measure. The
number of chemical substances previously launched was the only cancer-sitespeciﬁc, time-varying, measure of medical innovation. The previous research based
on US data indicates that non-pharmaceutical medical innovation is not positively
correlated across diseases with pharmaceutical innovation, but this may not apply to
Mexico. Future research may be able to overcome these and other limitations.

Abstract I assess the impact that pharmaceutical innovation had on cancer mortality in Mexico during the period 2003–2013, by investigating whether there were
larger declines in the age-standardized mortality rate of cancer sites (breast, lung,
colon, etc.) that were subject to more pharmaceutical innovation, controlling for
changes in the age-standardized cancer incidence rate. The estimates indicate that
new drugs launched during 1991–2001 reduced the age-standardized cancer mortality rate by 16%, i.e., at an average annual rate of about 1.6%. I estimate that
105,661 life-years before age 70 were gained in 2013 due to cancer drugs launched
during 1991–2001, and that the cost per life-year gained was in the neighborhood of
$2146. By the standards of the World Health Organization, new cancer drugs have
been very cost-effective in Mexico. The contribution of cancer drug innovation to
Mexican longevity growth has been valuable, but, perhaps, it could have been even
larger. Only half as many new cancer drugs were launched in Mexico during
2010–2014 as were launched in the US. In addition, when new drugs are launched in
Mexico, their diffusion tends to be quite slow.

Cancer mortality has declined in Mexico during the last 2 decades. As shown in
Fig. 1, the age-standardized cancer mortality rate1 of males declined by 13%, and
that of females declined by 11%, between 1995 and 2014.2 The mortality rate, or
(unconditional) probability of death from cancer, depends to an important extent on
two variables: the probability of getting (being diagnosed with) cancer, and the
probability of dying from cancer, conditional on having been diagnosed with
cancer: prob(death) & prob(diagnosis) * prob(death|diagnosis).3 Therefore, the
decline in the mortality rate could be due to either a decline in cancer incidence4, a
decline in the probability of dying from cancer, conditional on having been
diagnosed with cancer (e.g., due to improved treatment), or both.
The Mexican cancer incidence rate declined by 13% (from 147.3 to 128.4)
between 2002 and 2008, although it increased 2% (from 128.4 to 131.5) between
2008 and 2012.5 Since the cancer incidence rate declined at least as rapidly as the
cancer mortality rate in recent years, the decline in cancer mortality could be
entirely due to declining cancer incidence. However, the measurement of cancer
incidence is subject to signiﬁcant potential errors. For example, a decline in cancer
surveillance or screening could lead to a decline in measured cancer incidence, even
when true incidence is not declining.
The previous studies (Lichtenberg 2014a, 2015, 2016a, b) have shown that
pharmaceutical innovation—the introduction and use of new cancer drugs—has
signiﬁcantly reduced cancer mortality in countries at a ‘‘very high’’ level of human
development (as deﬁned by the United Nations Development Programme6). In this
study, I will assess the impact that pharmaceutical innovation and cancer incidence
had on cancer mortality in Mexico, a country at a lower (but still ‘‘high’’) level of

An age-standardized rate (ASR) is a summary measure of the rate that a population would have if it had
a standard age structure. Standardization is necessary when comparing several populations that differ with
respect to age, because age has a powerful inﬂuence on the risk of cancer. The ASR is a weighted mean of
the age-speciﬁc rates; the weights are taken from population distribution of the standard population. The
most frequently used standard population is the World Standard Population. The calculated incidence or
mortality rate is then called age-standardized incidence or mortality rate (world). It is also expressed per
100,000. See http://globocan.iarc.fr/Pages/glossary.aspx#MORTALITY.

In addition, between 1998 and 2013, mean age at death from cancer also increased by 1.8 years, from
62.3 to 64.1. Source: author’s calculations based on WHO Mortality Database (World Health
Organization (2016b)).

This approximation assumes that the probability that someone who has never been diagnosed with
cancer dies from cancer is quite small. This is plausible, because the cancer mortality rate (the
unconditional probability of dying from cancer) is about half as great as the cancer incidence rate (the
probability of being diagnosed with cancer).

Incidence is the number of new cases arising in a given period in a speciﬁed population. This
information is collected routinely by cancer registries. It can be expressed as an absolute number of cases
per year or as a rate per 100,000 persons per year.

Source: OECD Health Statistics 2016 database. Data on incidence prior to 2002 are not available. The
decline in incidence may be due, in part, to a decline in cigarette smoking, a major risk factor for lung
cancer. Between 2002 and 2015, the fraction of the population aged 15 ? who are daily smokers declined
from 12.4 to 7.6%.

human development. As in the previous studies, a difference-in-difference research
design will be used: I will investigate whether the decline in mortality was greater
for cancer sites (breast, lung, colon, etc.) subject to more pharmaceutical innovation
and greater declines in incidence. As shown in Fig. 2, the rate of decline in the
mortality rate varied considerably across cancer sites. The mortality rate declined by
at least 34% for 3 cancer sites (cervix, stomach, and lung), but increased for 3 other
cancer sites (colon, ovary, and breast).
In Sect. 2, I will formulate an econometric model of cancer mortality. The data
sources used to estimate these models are described in Sect. 3. Empirical results are
presented in Sect. 4. Rough estimates of the number of life-years gained in 2013
from the reduction in cancer mortality attributable to pharmaceutical innovation,
and of the average cost-effectiveness (cost per life-year gained) of new cancer
drugs, are developed in Sect. 5. Sect. 6 provides a summary and conclusions.

2 Econometric model of cancer mortality
The basic model which I will use to assess the impact of pharmaceutical innovation
and cancer incidence on age-standardized cancer mortality rates in Mexico is:

cancer at site s; dt = a ﬁxed effect for year t.
Inclusion of year and cancer-site ﬁxed effects controls for the overall decline in
cancer mortality and for stable between-cancer-site differences in mortality.
Negative and signiﬁcant estimates of bk in Eq. (1) would signify that cancer sites for
which there was more pharmaceutical innovation had larger declines in mortality,
controlling for changes in incidence.
Due to data limitations, the number of new chemical entities is the only cancersite-speciﬁc, time-varying, measure of medical innovation in Eq. (1). Both a
patient-level US study and a longitudinal country-level study have shown that
controlling for numerous other potential determinants of mortality does not reduce,
and may even increase, the estimated effect of pharmaceutical innovation. The
study based on patient-level data (Lichtenberg 2013) found that controlling for race,
education, family income, insurance coverage, Census region, BMI, smoking, the
mean year the person started taking his or her medications, and over 100 medical
conditions had virtually no effect on the estimate of the effect of pharmaceutical
innovation (the change in drug vintage) on life expectancy. The study based on
longitudinal country-level data (Lichtenberg 2014b) found that controlling for ten
health expenditure (public and private), the DPT immunization rate among children
ages 12–23 months, HIV prevalence, and tuberculosis incidence] increased the
coefﬁcient on pharmaceutical innovation by about 32%.
Failure to control for non-pharmaceutical medical innovation (e.g., innovation in
diagnostic imaging, surgical procedures, and medical devices) is also unlikely to
bias estimates of the effect of pharmaceutical innovation on premature mortality, for
two reasons. First, more than half of US funding for biomedical research came from
pharmaceutical and biotechnology ﬁrms (Dorsey et al. 2010). Much of the rest came
from the federal government (i.e., the NIH), and new drugs often build on upstream
government research (Sampat and Lichtenberg 2011). The National Cancer Institute
(2016a, b) says that it ‘‘has played an active role in the development of drugs for
cancer treatment for 50 years… [and] that approximately one half of the
chemotherapeutic drugs currently used by oncologists for cancer treatment were
discovered and/or developed’’ at the National Cancer Institute. Second, the previous
research based on US data (Lichtenberg 2014a, c) indicates that non-pharmaceutical
medical innovation is not positively correlated across diseases with pharmaceutical
innovation. However, while non-pharmaceutical medical innovation may not be
correlated with pharmaceutical innovation across diseases in the US, this need not
hold for Mexico.
The measure of pharmaceutical innovation in Eq. (1)—the number of chemical
substances previously registered to treat cancer at site s—is not the theoretically
ideal measure. Mortality is presumably more strongly related to the drugs actually
used to treat cancer than it is to the drugs that could be used to treat cancer. A
preferable measure is the mean vintage of drugs used to treat cancer at site s in year
P
P
t, deﬁned as VINTAGEst = d Qdst LAUNCH_YEARd/ d Qdst, where Qdst = the
quantity of drug d used to treat cancer at site s in year t, and LAUNCH_YEARd = the world launch year of drug d.7 Unfortunately, measurement of VINTAGEst is
infeasible: even though data on the total quantity of each drug in each year (Qd.t = Rs
Qdst) are available, many drugs are used to treat multiple diseases. There is no way
to determine the quantity of drug d used to treat cancer at site s in year t.8 However,
Lichtenberg (2014c) showed that in France, there is a highly signiﬁcant positive
correlation across drug classes between changes in the (quantity-weighted) vintage
of drugs and changes in the number of chemical substances previously registered
within the drug class.

According to the Merriam Webster dictionary, one deﬁnition of vintage is ‘‘a period of origin or
manufacture (e.g., a piano of 1845 vintage)’’. http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/vintage.
Solow (1960) introduced the concept of vintage into economic analysis. Solow’s basic idea was that
technical progress is ‘‘built into’’ machines and other goods and that this must be taken into account when
making empirical measurements of their roles in production. This was one of the contributions to the
theory of economic growth that the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences cited when it awarded Solow
the 1987 Alfred Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences (Nobelprize.org 2016).

Outpatient prescription drug claims usually do not show the indication of the drug prescribed. Claims
for drugs administered by doctors and nurses (e.g., chemotherapy) often show the indication of the drug,
‘world launch’ of cancer drugs and their ‘Mexico launch’.9 According to Solow’s
vintage hypothesis, later, vintage goods (e.g., drugs whose world launch years were
later) are likely to be of higher quality than earlier vintage goods. Holding constant
the Mexican launch year of a drug, the shorter the lag from world launch year to
Mexican launch year, the later the world launch year of the drug, and (according to
the vintage hypothesis), the higher the drug’s quality. However, controlling for the
length of time between the ‘world launch’ of cancer drugs and their ‘Mexico launch’
is problematic. I can compute the mean lag between the world launch year and the
Mexican launch year for cancer sites and years in which at least one drug had been
launched in Mexico. However, I cannot compute the mean lag for cancer sites and
years in which no drugs had been launched in Mexico. As shown in Table 2, 8
cancer sites had 0 drug launches by 1995; 4 cancer sites had 0 drugs launches by
2004. Controlling for the length of time between the ‘world launch’ of cancer drugs
and their ‘Mexico launch’ would require excluding those observations.
In Eq. (1), mortality from cancer at site s in year t depends on the number of new
chemical entities (drugs) to treat cancer at site s that had been launched in Mexico
by the end of year t - k, i.e., there is a lag of k years. Equation (1) will be estimated
for different values of k: k = 0, 3, 6,…,18. A separate model is estimated for each
value of k, rather than including multiple values (CUM_NCEs,t, CUM_NCEs,t-3,
CUM_NCEs,t-6,…) in a single model, because CUM_NCE is highly serially
correlated (by construction), which would result in extremely high multicollinearity
if multiple values were included. One would expect there to be a substantial lag,
because new drugs diffuse gradually—they will not be used widely until years after
registration. Data from the IMS Health MIDAS database can be used to provide
evidence about the process of diffusion of new medicines. I used data from that
source linked to data on Mexican drug launch dates (described below) to estimate
the following model:
À
Á
ln N RXdy ¼ qd þ py þ edy ;
ð2Þ
where N_RXdy= the number of standard units of cancer drug d sold in Mexico per
thousand population y years after it was launched (y = 0–3, 4–7, 8–11, 12–15,
16–19 years); qd = a À
ﬁxed effect for drug d; py = a ﬁxed effect for age y.
Á
The expression exp py À p16À19 is a ‘‘relative utilization index’’: it is the mean
ratio of the annual number of standard units of a cancer drug sold per thousand
population y years after it was ﬁrst launched in Mexico to the annual number of
standard units of the same drug sold per thousand population 16–19 years after it
was ﬁrst launched in Mexico.
Using annual data on the number of standard units of cancer drugs sold in Mexico
during the period 1999–2010, I estimated Eq. (2). Estimates of the ‘‘relative
utilization index’’ are shown in Fig. 3. These estimates indicate that utilization of a
drug is strongly positively related to how long the drug has been on the market. On
average, a drug is used 50 times as often per year 16–19 years post-launch as it is

Number of years since launch

Fig. 3 Relative utilization of cancer drugs in Mexico, by number of years since launch (index: ratio of
utilization y years since launch to utilization 16–19 years since launch)

0–3 year post-launch. Utilization appears to rise especially rapidly after year 11,
when drug patents tend to expire and generics enter the market.
The effect of a drug’s launch on mortality is likely to depend on both the quality
and the quantity of the drug. Indeed, it is likely to depend on the interaction between
quality and quantity: a quality improvement will have a greater impact on mortality
if drug utilization (quantity) is high. Although newer drugs tend to be of higher
quality than older drugs (see Lichtenberg 2014d), the relative quantity of very new
drugs is quite low, so the impact on mortality of very new drugs is lower than the
impact of older drugs.
In principle, mortality in year t should depend on a distributed lag of incidence,
i.e., on INCIDENCEs,t, INCIDENCEs,t-1, INCIDENCEs,t-2, INCIDENCEs,t-3…
Unfortunately, data on incidence by cancer site are available for only 2 years (2002
and 2012); this is why INCIDENCEs,t-2 is the only incidence variable included in
Eq. (1). The limited availability of incidence data also means that we can only use
mortality data for 2 years (2004 and 2014). Writing the model for each of these
years:
MORTs;2003 ¼ bk CUM NCEs;2003Àk þ cINCIDENCEs;2002 þ as þ d2003 þ es;2003 ;
ð3Þ
MORTs;2013 ¼ bk CUM NCEs;2013Àk þ c INCIDENCEs;2012 þ as þ d2013 þ es;2013 :

þ c INCIDENCEs;2012 À INCIDENCEs;2002
þ ðd2013 À d2003 Þ þ ðes;2013 À es;2003 Þ:
ð5Þ
Equation (5) may be rewritten as follows:
DMORTs ¼ bk DCUM NCE ks
þ c DINCIDENCE 1s þ d0 þ e0s ;

ð6Þ

where DMORTs = MORTs,2013 - MORTs,2003 = the 2003–2013 change in the
age-standardized mortality rate from cancer at site s; DCUM_NCE_ks =
CUM_NCEs,2013k - CUM_NCEs,2003-k = the number of drugs for cancer at site
s launched between year 2003 - k and 2013 - k; DINCIDENCE_1s =
INCIDENCEs,2012 - INCIDENCEs,2002 = the 2002–2012 change in the age-standardized incidence rate of cancer at site s; d0 = d2013 - d2003.
Equation (6) indicates that the 2003–2013 change in the age-standardized mortality
rate depends on two variables: the number of drugs launched between year 2003 - k
and 2013 - k, and the 2002–2012 change in the age-standardized incidence rate.
For estimates of bk from Eqs. (1) and (6) to be consistent estimates of the effect
of drug launches on mortality, the ‘‘parallel trends’’ assumption needs to be
satisﬁed. A simple way to test the validity of this assumption is to estimate a version
of Eq. (6) that includes a control for the trend in mortality in the ‘pre-period’, e.g.,
the period 1993–2003. Therefore, I will estimate the following model:
DMORTs ¼ bk DCUM NCE ks þ c DINCIDENCE 1s
þ p DMORT PREs þ d0 þ e0s ;

ð7Þ

where DMORT_PREs = MORTs,2003 - MORTs,1993 = the 1993–2003 change in
the age-standardized mortality rate from cancer at site s.

3 Data sources
Age-standardized cancer mortality rate data were obtained from the WHO Cancer
Mortality database (World Health Organization (2016a)).
Age-standardized cancer incidence rate data were obtained from GLOBOCAN
International Agency for Research on Cancer (2016). Mortality and incidence data
are reported separately by sex. For cancers affecting both sexes, we computed the
simple mean of the sex-speciﬁc rates. For cancers affecting only one sex (breast,
cervical, ovarian, and prostate), we computed 50% of the single-sex rate.
Data on drugs approved for different types of cancer were obtained from the US
National Cancer Institute.
Data on Mexican launch dates of drugs were obtained from the IMS Health New
in the IMS New Product Focus database) is usually the year in which the drug was ﬁrst
sold in Mexico (as indicated in the IMS MIDAS database). In a few cases, the drug was
ﬁrst sold in Mexico in the year after the Mexican launch year. I deﬁne CUM_NCEst as
the number of post-1981 new chemical entities (i.e., NCEs ﬁrst launched anywhere in
the world after 1981) used to treat cancer at site s that had been launched in Mexico by
the end of year t. Since the New Product Focus data are left-censored (no pre-1982
data), this measure is subject to error, because CUM_NCEst will not (but should)
include pre-1982 NCEs that were ﬁrst launched in Mexico after 1981. If this
measurement error is random, it is likely to bias estimates of bk towards zero.
Annual data on the number of standard units of cancer drugs sold in Mexico
during the period 1999–2010 were obtained from the IMS Health MIDAS database.
Data on age-standardized mortality and incidence rates, by cancer site and year,
are shown in Table 1.
Data on the number of post-1981 drugs ever launched in Mexico, by cancer site
and year, are shown in Table 2.
Mexican launch dates of drugs used to treat different types of cancer are shown in
Appendix Table 5.

4 Empirical results
Estimates of the pharmaceutical innovation (bk) parameters of the cancer mortality
rate model (Eq. (1) for different values of k are shown in Table 3. Each estimate is
from a separate model. For simplicity, estimates of the incidence coefﬁcient (c) are
not shown here. Estimates of the incidence coefﬁcient were positive and signiﬁcant
(and virtually identical) in all models, indicating that mortality declined more for
cancer sites that had larger declines in incidence.
The ﬁrst seven rows of Table 3 show estimates based on mortality and incidence
data for both sexes combined. Row 1 shows the estimate of b0, i.e., of the
pharmaceutical innovation coefﬁcient when there is no lag between the number of
drugs ever launched and the mortality rate. The estimate of b0 is negative but only
marginally statistically signiﬁcant (p = 0.07). This is not surprising, since, as shown
in Fig. 3, utilization of recently launched drugs tends to be quite low.
Row 2 shows the estimate of b3, i.e., of the pharmaceutical innovation coefﬁcient
when there is a 3-year lag between the number of drugs ever launched and the mortality
rate. The estimate of b3 is negative and statistically signiﬁcant (p = 0.03). Rows 3–7 of
Table 3 show estimates of bk for k = 6, 9, 12, 15, and 18, respectively. All ﬁve bk
estimates are negative and statistically signiﬁcant (p B 0.031). These estimates signify
that the mortality rate is inversely related to the number of drugs that had ever been
launched 3–18 years earlier, controlling for the incidence rate.10 The estimates of bk
based on data for both sexes combined are plotted in Panel A of Fig. 4.
10

Controlling for incidence is important. If DINCIDENCE_2s is excluded from the model, none of the bk
parameter estimates are statistically signiﬁcant. DCUM_NCE_k and DINCIDENCE_2 are positively
correlated across cancer sites—there were more drug launches for cancer sites that had larger increases in

To calculate the change in the mean mortality rate attributable to pharmaceutical
innovation, we can multiply the estimate of bk (column 1 of Table 3) by the mean
value of DCUM_NCE_k (column 5); the result is shown in column 6. These
calculations imply that new drugs launched during the period 1991–2001 had the
largest (most negative) effect on the 2003–2011 change in mortality. Henceforth, I
will focus on the estimates of the model when k = 12.
The two explanatory variables (DCUM_NCE_12 and DINCIDENCE_1) in the
mortality change (DMORT) model jointly explain 77% of the variance across
cancer sites in the 2003–2013 change in the mortality rate. The mean mortality rate
declined by 0.47 between 2003 and 2013. The estimates imply that new drugs
launched during 1991–2001 reduced the mean mortality rate by 0.47. The mean
mortality rate in 2003 was 2.99, so this indicates that new drugs launched during
1998–2008 reduced the mean mortality rate by 16% (= 0.47/2.99), i.e., at an average
annual rate of about 1.6%. The decline in incidence also reduced the mean mortality
as ? dt ? est for different values of k

Estimates in bold are statistically signiﬁcant (p-value \ .05)

also indicate that if no new drugs had been launched during 1991–2001 and the
incidence rate had not declined between 2002 and 2012, the mortality rate would
have increased by 0.28 between 2003 and 2013, although the estimated increase (the
intercept) is not statistically signiﬁcant.
Rows 8–14 of Table 3 show estimates based on mortality and incidence data for

Fig. 4 Estimates of bk parameters of Eq. (1), MORTst = bk CUM_NCEs, t-k ? c INCIDENCEs, t-1 ? as
? dt ? est for different values of k. a Both sexes, b females, c males

Rows 15–21 of Table 3 show estimates based on mortality and incidence data for
males only. The estimates are not statistically signiﬁcant when k B 9, but all three
estimates for k C 12 are negative and statistically signiﬁcant. These estimates are
plotted in Panel C of Fig. 4. The difference between the effects of pharmaceutical
innovation on female and male cancer mortality rates is not statistically signiﬁcant.
For example, the p value on the difference between the female and male estimates
of b12 in Table 3 (0.0972 = - 0.2218 to (- 0.3191)) is 0.51 (Chi-square = 0.44).
Launching of new drugs in Mexico may not be strictly exogenous with respect to
instrument that I used for CUM_NCEs,t-k (the number of drugs to treat cancer at site
s that had been launched in Mexico by the end of year t-k) is
CUM_NCE_FOREIGNs,t-k (the number of drugs to treat cancer at site s that had
been launched outside of Mexico by the end of year t-k), deﬁned as follows:
P
CUM_NCE_FOREIGNs,t-k = d INDds LAUNCHED_FOREIGNd,t-k = the number of new chemical entities (drugs) to treat cancer at site s that had been launched
outside of Mexico by the end of year t-k (k = 0, 3, 6,…,18):LAUNCHED
FOREIGNd;tÀk ¼ 1 if drug d had been launched outside of Mexico by the end
of year t À k¼ 0 if drug d had not been launched outside of Mexico by the end
of year t À k:
The ﬁrst stage of the two-stage IV estimation procedure is to estimate the
following equation:
CUM NCEs;tÀk ¼ X CUM NCE FOREIGNs;tÀk þ as þ dt þ est :

ð8Þ

CUM_NCE_FOREIGNs,t-k is a good instrument for CUM_NCEs,t-k: when
k = 12, the estimate of X is 0.8368 (Z = 6.24; p \ 0.0001). The second stage is to
estimate Eq. (1), replacing the actual value of CUM_NCEs,t-k by its predicted value
from Eq. (8). The IV estimate of b12 for both sexes (IV estimate = 0.2329;
Z = 4.06; p \ 0.0001) is very similar to the OLS estimate shown in row 5 of
Table 3.
As discussed earlier, the ‘‘parallel trends’’ assumption needs to be satisﬁed for the
estimates in Table 3 and Fig. 4 to be consistent estimates of the effect of drug
launches on mortality. To provide evidence about the validity of this assumption, in
Table 4, I present estimates of Eq. (7), which includes a control for the trend in
mortality in the ‘pre-period’, e.g., the period 1993–2003. These estimates are based
on a smaller set of cancer sites, because, as shown in Table 1, data on agestandardized mortality rates are less complete in 1993 than they are in 2003 and
2013. Rows 22–28 of Table 4 show estimates of Eq. (7) based on data for both
sexes combined for this smaller set of cancer sites when the trend in mortality in the
‘pre-period’ (1993–2003) is excluded from the equation. Rows 29–35 show
estimates of Eq. (7) based on the same sample when the trend in mortality in the
‘pre-period’ is included in the equation. The coefﬁcient (p) on the pre-period
mortality trend is signiﬁcant (and positive) only when k C 15. Controlling for the
pre-period mortality trend does not substantially change the estimates of bk. The
2003–2013 change in the age-standardized mortality rate is inversely related to the
change in the number of drugs ever launched 12–18 years earlier, controlling for the
2002–2012 change in incidence and the ‘pre-period’ (1993–2003) change in the
mortality rate.
The relationship across cancer sites between the number of new drugs launched
during 1985–1995 and the 2003–2013 change in the mortality rate, controlling for
the ‘‘pre-period’’ (1993–2003) change in the mortality rate and the 2002–2012
change in the incidence rate, is shown in Fig. 5; this chart corresponds to the
estimate of b18 shown in row 35 of Table 4. The ﬁgure indicates that the three

Fig. 5 Relationship across cancer sites between the number of new drugs launched during 1985–1995
and the 2003–2013 change in the mortality rate, controlling for the 1993–2003 change in the mortality
2002–2012 change in the incidence rate and the trend in mortality in the preperiod. Excluding these three cancer sites from the sample does not have much
effect on the estimate of b18; when they are excluded, the estimate of b18 is - 0.357
(t = 8.15; p = 0.0039).

5 Discussion
The estimates indicate that the launch of new drugs subsequently reduced cancer
mortality. New drugs launched during 1991–2001 are estimated to have reduced the
age-standardized cancer mortality rate by 16%, i.e., at an average annual rate of
about 1.6%.
Now, I will develop a rough estimate of the number of life-years gained in 2013
from the reduction in cancer mortality attributable to pharmaceutical innovation, and
of the average cost-effectiveness (cost per life-year gained) of new cancer drugs.
To do this, I will estimate the decline in the premature mortality rate
attributable to pharmaceutical innovation. The premature mortality rate is the
number of potential years of life lost (PYLL) per 100,000 population (OECD
2017a, b). PYLL is a summary measure of premature mortality that provides an
explicit way of weighting deaths occurring at younger ages. The calculation of
PYLL involves summing up deaths occurring at each age and multiplying this with
the number of remaining years to live up to a selected age limit.11 The limit of
70 years was chosen for the calculations in OECD Health Statistics. To assure
cross-country and trend comparison, the PYLL are standardized, for each country
and each year. The total OECD population in 2010 is taken as the reference
population for age standardization.
As shown in Table 1, between 2003 and 2013, the age-standardized mortality rate for
all cancers combined declined by 15%, from 73.0 to 62.3. The estimates in Table 4
imply that virtually, this entire decline was due to the previous launches of new cancer
drugs. During the same period, according to the OECD, the premature cancer mortality
rate (the number of PYLL before age 70/100,000 population below age 70) declined by
11.4%, from 782.4 to 693.4. It seems reasonable to assume that this entire decline was
also due to the previous launches of new cancer drugs. Therefore, in the absence of the
previous new drug launches, premature cancer mortality would have been 12.8% (= (1/
(1 - 0.114)) - 1) higher in 2013 than it actually was. Actual PYLL before age 70 due
to cancer in 2013 was 823,209 (= 693.4 * (118,720,632/100,000)). I estimate that in the
absence of previous new drug launches, premature cancer mortality would have been
928,870 (= 112.8% * 823,209).
This calculation implies that 105,661 life-years before age 70 were gained in
2013 due to new cancer drugs. This is a rough estimate of the longevity beneﬁt in
2013 to people under 70 of cancer drugs launched during the period 1991–2001. To
calculate the average cost-effectiveness of these drugs, I would like to measure
11
This measure incorporates both the reduction in the number of deaths and the increase in mean age at
during the period 1991–2001. Unfortunately, these data are not available. However,
I do have unpublished data from the IMS Health MIDAS database on expenditure
(by or on behalf of all patients) by drug in 2010. Expenditure in 2010 on cancer
drugs launched during 1991–2001 was $315 million.12 72% of people diagnosed
with cancer in 2012 were below age 70 (source: GLOBOCAN). Expenditure in
2010 by or on behalf of people below age 70 on cancer drugs launched during
1994–2004 may, therefore, have been $227 million (= 72% * $315 million).
These calculations imply that the cost per life-year gained by people below age
70 from new cancer drugs was in the neighborhood of $2146 (= $227 million/
105,661 life-years). This ﬁgure may be somewhat underestimated, since it is based
on 2010 expenditure data.13 On the other hand, Lichtenberg (2014a) showed that in
the US, about 25% of the cost of new drugs (for all diseases) tends to be offset by
reduced expenditure on old drugs, so the cost per life-year gained may have been
below $2000.
The World Health Organization considers interventions whose cost per qualityadjusted life-year (QALY) gained is less than per capita GDP to be ‘‘very costeffective’’ (Bertram et al. 2016); Mexico’s per capita GDP in 2011 was $10,307.14
The estimated cost per life-year gained from the previous pharmaceutical innovation
is also well below the vast majority of estimates from the value-of-life literature of
the value of a life-year (see Hirth et al. 2000).

6 Summary and conclusions
I assessed the impact that pharmaceutical innovation had on cancer mortality in
Mexico during the period 2003–2013, by investigating whether there were larger
declines in mortality for cancer sites (breast, lung, colon, etc.) that were subject to
more pharmaceutical innovation, controlling for changes in cancer incidence. New
drugs launched during 1991–2001 are estimated to have reduced the agestandardized cancer mortality rate by 16%, i.e., at an average annual rate of about
1.6%. I estimated that 105,661 life-years before age 70 were gained in 2013 due to
cancer drugs launched during 1997–2007, and that the cost per life-year gained was
in the neighborhood of $2146. By the standards of the World Health Organization,
new cancer drugs have been very cost-effective in Mexico.
The contribution of cancer drug innovation to Mexican longevity growth has
been valuable, but, perhaps, it could have been even larger. According to the IMS
Institute for Healthcare Informatics (2016), during the period 2010–2014, 49 new
cancer medicines were launched worldwide. As shown in Fig. 6, about twice as

Expenditure in 2010 on all post-1981 cancer drugs was $393 million. This represents 2.4% of total
2010 pharmaceutical expenditure ($16.6 billion of US dollars at exchange rate) reported in MIDAS. The
OECD estimate of total pharmaceutical sales in 2010 is 24% higher: $20.6 billion.
13
According to the OECD, between 2010 and 2013, total pharmaceutical sales (in US$ at exchange rate)
increased 3.6% (from $20.6 billion to $21.3 billion).

Fig. 6 Number of 2010–2014 cancer medicines that have been launched in various regions

many of these have been launched in the US as have been launched in Mexico.15 In
addition, as shown in Fig. 3, when new drugs are launched in Mexico, their
diffusion is quite slow.
Due to unavailability of data, this study is subject to several limitations. The
measure of pharmaceutical innovation—the number of chemical substances
previously launched to treat cancer—is not the theoretically ideal measure. The
number of chemical substances previously launched was the only cancer-sitespeciﬁc, time-varying, measure of medical innovation. The previous research based
on US data indicates that non-pharmaceutical medical innovation is not positively
correlated across diseases with pharmaceutical innovation, but this may not apply to
Mexico. Future research may be able to overcome these and other limitations.
