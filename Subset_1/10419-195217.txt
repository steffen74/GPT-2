
Nowadays, economies in Latin America are becoming more and more knowledge
based. Innovation becomes essential to spur economic growth and to raise living
standards. At the ﬁrm level, either competition or collusion could reward innovation
by providing strong incentives for ﬁrms to be more efﬁcient than their rivals. This
paper aims to study the extent to which innovation incentives in a duopoly change
according to the extent of product substitutability and the ‘‘technological distance’’
of ﬁrms. We draw particular attention to ﬁrms’ (full/partial) collusive behavior and
attempt to address the following questions: What type of collusion (partial, full,
none) should ﬁrms choose, and which one is more conducive to technological
advancement and a ﬁrm’s growth? How do ﬁrms choose different types of collusion,
and how do these affect market outcomes? Can the collusive strategy improve the
consumer surplus and the social welfare, and which one serves best?
Innovation through R&D investment leads to more efﬁcient use of resources,
creating sustainable competitive advantages. The most important aspect of R&D
investment is the externality (spillovers) which has been studied through the
divergence between the social and private returns of production process. The public
goods feature of knowledge generates spillovers which allow others to use the
owner’s innovation free of charge. Due to the spillover effect, the rate of return from
an innovation is lesser and as a result, the incentives for carrying out R&D are
reduced. The individual ﬁrm fears that competitors use its internal research results
and thus probably increase their proﬁts without having to bear the expenses.
Therefore, the researching ﬁrm will only have limited incentive to invest in R&D.
However, from the collective viewpoint, spillovers strengthen the dissemination of
new knowledge available for the whole society, and improve the social welfare
(Amir 2000).
Within a game where ﬁrms are ﬁrst engaged in costly research efforts to adopt a
lower-cost technology and then compete in a Cournot fashion with homogeneous
products, (D’Aspremont and Jacquemin 1988) (henceforth ‘‘AJ’’) show that ﬁrms
invest more under R&D cooperation than under R&D competition for sufﬁciently
high spillover effects (full competition versus full cooperation). Kamien et al.
(1992) (henceforth ‘‘KMZ’’) extend the AJ model to a more general framework with
product differentiation and allow ﬁrms to participate in a research joint venture
(RJV). They show that ﬁrms should be encouraged to form a RJV only if they
coordinate their R&D decisions while maintaining competition for sales. Concerning the welfare effects of cooperative R&D with spillovers, cooperation raises social
welfare when the spillover is high (Suzumura 1992).
Compared to aforementioned works, this paper emphasizes the ‘‘close relationship’’ between product differentiation and R&D spillovers. The key feature is to
consider that the extent of product differentiation determines the ability of a ﬁrm to
appropriate its rival’s R&D effort. In addition, this ability is inﬂuenced by the
sensibility of spillovers relative to product differentiation, in other words,
technological distance. Several explanations can be provided to justify this ‘‘close
production technique resulting from rival’s R&D effort. Second, the exchange of
technological information between engineers of competing ﬁrms is recognized as an
important source of R&D spillovers (Severinov 2001). Spillovers are believed to be
higher between technological neighbors. According to this view, the ability to make
productive use of another ﬁrm’s knowledge depends on the degree of technological
distance between ﬁrms. Every technology has a somewhat unique set of applications
and language. Researchers in similar technological ﬁelds will interact in professional organizations, publish in commonly read journals, and, increasingly, browse
a common set of web pages. It is natural to consider that the dissemination of
technological knowledge across competing ﬁrms is strong when ﬁrms’ technologies
are similar. Furthermore, the above-mentioned ‘‘close relationship’’ is divided into
two categories: concave relationship (technological proximity) where ﬁrms adopt
similar technologies (i.e., the similar smart phones produced by Apple, Blackberry,
Nokia ...), convex relationship (technological alienation) where ﬁrms adopt
different technologies (i.e., electricity can be produced by different technologies).
To be more concrete, we take the electricity production, for example, electric power
companies are differentiated by voltages, a commercial consumer may need a
voltage level of 11 kV or 440 V while a residential consumer needs power at level
of 240 V, this difference of voltages refers to product differentiation. The electricity
can be produced by different technologies (i.e., solar panels, wind turbines, nuclear
energy), this refers to the extent of technological distance. The R&D ﬂow between
companies employing the same output (voltage) and the same technique is
obviously greater.
In location models, the distance between ﬁrms determines the degree of product
differentiation. By considering that R&D spillover depends negatively on ﬁrms’
product location, it is shown that R&D effort is positively associated with the
differentiation of products1 (Piga and Poyago-Theotoky 2005). However, they do
not address the important issue of cooperative behavior between ﬁrms in their
models.
In this paper, we consider a two-stage game where ﬁrms with heterogeneous
products competing in a Cournot fashion engage in upstream R&D and downstream
production. At each stage, the competing ﬁrms can either coordinate their decisions
or adopt non-cooperative strategy. This assumption allows us to compare the Subgame Perfect Nash Equilibrium (henceforth ‘‘SPNE’’) emerging in the four separate
scenarios : full competition, semi-collusion in Production2, Semi-collusion in R&D3
and Full Collusion4. Compared to Kamien et al. (1992) which claim that the R&D
investment by ﬁrms engaged in Semi-collusion in R&D is unambiguously greater
than that in the Full Competition regime irrespective of spillovers, we demonstrate
in fact which regime generates more R&D effort in equilibrium depends upon both

spillover.

restrict our attention to the concave relationship, Full Collusion participants spend
most on R&D, and Semi-collusion participants spend more than ﬁrms in the Full
Competition regime. This ranking of R&D efforts is unalterable and independent of
the product differentiation, and the competition at the upstream stage depresses
R&D investment. Firms colluding in R&D regardless of their production strategy
always yield more proﬁt and generate higher social welfare than ﬁrms colluding in
output independently of R&D strategy. When products are close substitutes, the
synergy effects prevail over the anti-competitive effects due to the high spillovers,
Full Collusion becomes a welfare-enhancing regime. Focusing on the convex
relationship, R&D cooperation may reduce ﬁrms’ interest to invest in R&D, and it is
possible that ﬁrms in the Full Collusion regime produce most and generate the
highest level of social welfare. Furthermore, horizontal mergers might be
interpreted as a Full Collusion where the participants coordinate their decisions
with respect to all of strategic variables. Thus, we launch the discussion about
antitrust policy, and shed light on the leniency of the total welfare standard and the
restrictiveness of the consumer welfare standard.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the model and
solves the SPNE in the four alternative regimes. We compare R&D effort, proﬁt,
consumer surplus and social welfare according to ﬁrms’ behavior (competitive or
collusive) in Sect. 3. Section 4 concludes this paper.

2 The model
2.1 Hypothesis
Consider an industry with two ﬁrms producing imperfectly substitutable goods. The
representative consumer has a quasi-linear utility function
1
Uðqi ; qj Þ ¼ aðqi þ qj Þ À ðq2 þ q2 þ 2cqi qj Þ
j
2 i

ð1Þ

where ‘‘qi ’’ is the output of ﬁrm i; ‘‘a’’ is a constant which is assumed to be
sufﬁciently large so that all ﬁrms product positive amounts in equilibrium; ‘‘c’’
measures the substitutability5 between the products and c 2 ½0; 1Þ. The utility
function generates the following inverse demand function faced by ﬁrm i:
pi ðqi ; qj Þ ¼ a À qi À cqj

ð2Þ

The production technology exhibits a constant marginal cost ‘‘c’’ which can be
reduced by investing in R&D. Due to spillovers (b), the R&D effort not only leads
to a decrease in its own marginal cost, but also reduces the marginal cost of the rival

5

If c ¼ 0, ﬁrms’ products are not substitutable and each ﬁrm acts as a monopolist. Note that, when
products are perfect substitutes, the spillover obviously equals to 1 and the game cannot be solved. See
marginal cost is
Ci ðxi ; xj Þ ¼ c À xi À bxj

ð3Þ

The R&D cost is assumed to be quadratic (1 x2 ), which reﬂects the decreasing
2 i
returns to R&D effort.
The individual proﬁt of ﬁrm i is deﬁned by
À
Á
1
pi ¼ pi ðqi ; qj Þ À Ci ðxi ; xj Þ qi À x2
2 i

with i 6¼ j; i; j ¼ 1; 2

ð4Þ

The social welfare is the sum of producer surplus (denoted by PS) and consumer
surplus (denoted by CS):
W ¼ PS þ CS

with PS ¼ pi þ pj ; CS ¼ U À pi qi À pj qj

ð5Þ

The key feature of the model is to consider that the extent of product substitutability
(c) determines the ability of a ﬁrm to appropriate its rival’ R&D effort. When
products are less differentiated, competing ﬁrms share closer technological spaces,
and one ﬁrm can beneﬁt more from the rival’s effort. We assume that the relationship between the spillover parameter (b) and the degree of product differentiation (c) is described by:
!
1 3
bðc; hÞ ¼ ch with h 2 ; ; c 2 ½0; 1Þ
ð6Þ
2 2
where the parameter ‘‘h’’ determines both the sensibility of the R&D spillover to the
degree of product differentiation, in other words, the measure of technological
distance6, and the level of spillovers for a given value of differentiation (see Fig. 1).
The assumption h 2 ½1 ; 3 is necessary to guarantee the equilibrium existence in the
2 2
four alternative scenarios. The range of h permits us to touch upon the issue of
concavity (technological proximity, h\1) and convexity (technological alienation,
h [ 1). As ob [ 0 and ob \0, we incur that, for any given value of c, the concave
oc
oh
relationship implies a more important spillover effect than the convex relationship.
From the perspective of technological distance, the concavity refers to the situations
where ﬁrms adopt similar technologies. Under concavity condition, the more differentiated are the products (close to 0), R&D spillovers are more sensitive to c. One
can imagine that the concavity (h\1) corresponds to industries that are geographically concentrated and that rely upon sources of basic scientiﬁc knowledge or
general purpose technologies (GPT) in the cluster7 beneﬁt most from the exchange
of knowledge and technology. By contrast, under convexity condition, the less
differentiated are products (close to 1), the more sensitive R&D spillovers with
respect to c, and the convexity delineates the situations where ﬁrms adopt different
technologies.
6

From the perspective of technological distance, it is straightforward that the more technologies are
similar, the greater are spillovers, for a given level of product differentiation.

7


We consider a two-stage game where ﬁrms act simultaneously at each stage.
Firms select a strategic action (R&D effort) at the ﬁrst stage anticipating correctly
its impact at the second stage. The two competing ﬁrms can either coordinate their
decisions or adopt non-cooperative strategy at each stage. When ﬁrms collude in
one dimension (R&D or production) and compete in another one, such behavior is
called semi-collusion (Fershtman and Gandal 1994). We compare the SPNE
emerging in the four alternative scenarios (Table 1) such as Full Competition, Semicollusion in Production, Semi-collusion in R&D and Full Collusion.
2.2 Sub-game equilibrium in the four regimes
2.2.1 Full competition
We begin with regime F, where there is no cooperation in any of the stages. The
SPNE is obtained by backward induction. Firm i chooses output qi to maximize
individual proﬁt pi , and the ﬁrm i’s output as a function of R&D efforts is given by:

When the technological distance is large enough (h [ 1 þ log 2 ), the technologies

adopted by ﬁrms are very different, one ﬁrm’s production will be negatively
affected by its rival’s R&D investment. By substituting Eq. (7) into the proﬁt
function Eq. (4), we can rewrite the proﬁt function as pF ðxF ; xF Þ. In the ﬁrst stage,

Despite the ostensibly widespread use of Full Collusion to exploit the complementarities in ﬁrm’s R&D process, the formal literature on R&D has almost focus
exclusively on research joint venture, whereby ﬁrms share out technological
knowledge (b ¼ 1) while continuing to compete against each other in product
market (see Kamien et al. 1992).8 Here, we regard this scenario as the framework of
multi-dimensional coordination in which ﬁrms cooperate in both R&D and
production stages. Since, the products are imperfectly substitutable, Full Collusion9
means that the ﬁrms maximize their joint proﬁt in each stage.

In the following section, we will compare these four aforementioned regimes in
terms of signiﬁcative relevance such as R&D investment, proﬁt, consumer surplus
and social welfare.

3 Comparison of different regimes
3.1 R&D effort
We start with the comparison of R&D investment level and address the question:
which regime generates the highest level of R&D effort in equilibrium? To compare
individual levels of R&D under different regimes, let us deﬁne the functions fk ðc; hÞ,
gk ðc; hÞ and jF ðc; hÞ

Kamien et al. (1992) provide a thorough analysis of RJV, contrasting the case of RJV Competition
where ﬁrms pool R&D results, but behave non-cooperatively at both stages, and RJV Cartelization (the
pooling of R&D results with cooperative determination of R&D investment, but competition in
subsequent product market stage). Suzumura (1992) and Suzumura and Yanagawa (1993) contain a
closely related analysis. D’Aspremont and Jacquemin (1988) do allow for merger under which ﬁrms pool
R&D results and cooperate in both stage of the game. It is worth noting that there are the analysis of the
converse case to RJV, where all ﬁrms compete in R&D stage, but then collude in outputs, see Fershtman
and Gandal (1994) and Brod and Shivakumar (1999).

pattern implies the ranking of R&D efforts into ﬁve zones (Fig. 2).

When ﬁrms have same behavior in the upstream stage, the downstream
cooperation can incite ﬁrms to exert more R&D investment.
When ﬁrms adopt different technologies and produce differentiated goods
(cf. Fig. 2, green area), the ﬁrms colluding in production will invest most in
R&D.


Under technological proximity, ﬁrms with two-stage cooperation have most
incentive to invest in R&D without ambiguity.

First of all, we ﬁnd when ﬁrms have same behavior (cooperation or competition)
in the upstream R&D stage, ﬁrms allowed to cooperate in the product market always
exert more R&D efforts in equilibrium, compared to ﬁrms competing in the
downstream stage (xM [ xR and xP [ xF 8 c; h). As we know, R&D efforts reduce
the marginal cost and indirectly lead to a decrease of the product price. When ﬁrms
can collude in the downstream stage, they restrict their outputs for a given R&D
effort and as a consequence, the negative impact of R&D efforts on the product
price is alleviated. Conversely, an intense product competition dissipates the
beneﬁts of R&D effort and, therefore, shrinks the incentive to invest in R&D. The
output cooperation has a positive impact on R&D investment and then induces ﬁrms
to undertake more R&D than they would under competition in the downstream
stage.
The output cooperation reinforces the R&D effort for a given behavior at
upstream stage. However, when the behavior at downstream stage is given, the
R&D cooperation does not unambiguously increase research efforts. If we compare
the regime F with the regime R (corresponding, respectively, to the lowest level in
terms of R&D effort), it is found that R&D cooperation could be detrimental to
R&D effort in zone I and zone II. This ﬁnding is in sharp contrast with the existing
literature, for instance, Kamien et al. (1992) show that xR is unambiguously greater
than xF without taking into account the close relationship emphasized in this paper.
The striking outcome we ﬁnd here is that R&D investment under regime P can be
the largest (cf. Fig. 2, green area). It is different from the conventional wisdom that
merged (two-stage cooperation) ﬁrms have more incentive to invest in R&D,
because they appropriate all of the R&D efforts. The spillover effect (in zones I,II
and III) constitutes a positive, but very small externality. When ﬁrms cooperate in
the upstream stage (regimes M, R), on the one hand this small externality is
internalized, on the other hand the R&D cooperation cannot promote the spending
on common research of ﬁrms due to technological alienation (convexity). However,
Semi-collusion in Production can intensify the R&D competition by production
cooperation, and incites ﬁrms to invest more in R&D. Therefore, the regime P leads
R&D spillover is concave (red area), the ranking of R&D efforts
(xM [ xR [ xP [ xF ) does not alter, and it is independent of the product
differentiation. It means that the Full Collusion participants spend more on R&D
than Semi-collusion ones, under concave relationship (technological proximity).
From the aggregate surplus point of view, the welfare performance of R&D
investment in the different scenarios can be gauged, and we compare them with the
First-Best welfare criterion (Suzumura 1992). ‘‘Appendix 1’’ provides the proof of
the expression xFB :
xFB ¼

Að1 þ ch Þ
ð1 þ cÞ À ð1 þ ch Þ2

ð17Þ

Obviously, xFB is the signiﬁcant standard accessing whether the R&D investment is
efﬁcient, when the denominator ð1 þ cÞ À ð1 þ ch Þ2 is positive.

emphasize the area xFB [ maxfxF ; xR ; xP ; xM g. The smooth curve xFB ¼ 0 divides
the pattern into two parts and the left one represents xFB [ 0. The intersection area
between the smooth curve and the zigzag curve (xFB ¼ xP ) deﬁnes combinations of
c and h where xP [ xFB . D’Aspremont and Jacquemin (1988) and Henriques (1990)
show that the social optimum R&D effort was unambiguously greater than the level
of R&D investment in equilibrium under the fully cooperative or non-cooperative or
mixed10 game. Compared to them, we ﬁnd the similar result when ﬁrms produce
sufﬁciently heterogeneous goods. Furthermore, it is worthwhile to note xP can be
higher than xFB in an inﬁnitesimal area where a higher level of R&D effort
corresponds to a wasteful duplication.
3.2 Output and consumer surplus
Due to symmetric equilibria, output is considered as an index of consumer surplus
ðCSk ¼ ð1 þ cÞðqk Þ2 with k ¼ fF; P; R; MgÞ. We trace out the meaningful areas by
plotting the following curves:

The level of output and consumer welfare in fully cooperative scenario can
be higher (cf. Fig. 4, green area) than that in partially cooperative or fully
non-cooperative situations.
When ﬁrms adopt similar technologies (concavity), R&D cooperation
(regimes M and R) encourages ﬁrms to produce more, and leads to ﬁerce
output competition.
Firms under Full Competition can produce most and achieve the highest
level of consumer welfare (red area), if and only if they use very different
technologies and produce highly differentiated goods.

Apart from Semi-collusion in Production, each regime can yield the highest level
of output (consumer surplus) for plausible parameter combinations. When ﬁrms
produce sufﬁciently similar goods, the Full Collusion regime ensures the highest
level (green area). This ﬁnding is in contrast with the traditional literature ‘‘the ﬁrms
under Full Competition always produce more than the ﬁrms under Full Collusion
scenarios’’11. The reason behind this is the substitutability–spillover relationship:
11

D’Aspremont and Jacquemin (1988) and Henriques (1990) demonstrate the level of output in noncooperative two-stage case is always higher than that in fully cooperative situation. In addition, they
claim that the mixed game can generate more output than non-cooperative two-stage game for large
spillovers, on the other hand, it induces ﬁrms under Full Collusion to spend more on
R&D (Result 1), accordingly the marginal cost of Full Collusion participants is
sufﬁciently reduced, ﬁrms under Full Collusion have interest to expand their output.
We also ﬁnd that the output level is the highest in the regime R when the goods are
sufﬁciently differentiated (zones II,III,IV,V). Furthermore, if the sensibility
parameter h is comparatively large (technological alienation), Full Competition
generates the highest output level (zone I). The reason of the instable relationship
between qR and qM arises from the sensibility of output to R&D effort: in the
symmetric equilibria, the sensibility under regime R and M is, respectively, given by
oqR 2 À chþ1 þ 2ch À c

It is found that oqR [ oqM , this inequality discloses that the output in the regime R is
ox
ox
more sensitive to R&D effort compared to the one in the regime M. In addition,
xM [ xR holds true at all time (Result 1). Indeed, qM can be greater than qR in some
zones (VI and VII).
There is no stable hierarchy because the impact of R&D effort is complicated and
exerts two conﬂicting effects on the output of rival ﬁrm. On the one hand, R&D effort is
managed to induce the ﬁrm to expand output at expense of its rival by cutting down its
own production cost. It is considered as the substitutability effect (an increase in its own
output leads to a decrease in rival’s output) which is greater, the more substitutable the
products are. On the other hand, the R&D effort can reduce the rival ﬁrm’s cost, thereby
increase its rival ﬁrm’s output. It is regarded as the spillover effect (boosting rival’s
output) which is greater the larger the spillover is. Since the spillover depends
positively on the degree of product differentiation, when products are quasi
homogeneous, both substitutability effect and spillover effect enlarge. Whether the
output (consumer surplus) increases depends on the interplay of these two conﬂicting
effects. If the spillover effect prevails over the substitutability effect, ﬁrms are
motivated to expand output; otherwise, they prefer to shrink output.
According to Fig. 4, it is clear that ﬁrms colluding in R&D produce more than ﬁrms
competing on R&D (qR ; qM [ qP ; qF ) when the relationship between substitutability
and spillover is concave (h\1). This result holds always true regardless of product
differentiation. Under the circumstance that the leakage of know-how is relatively
strong (concave relationship), ﬁrms cooperating on R&D are willing to spend more on
R&D efforts (Result 1), the marginal costs of both ﬁrms are reduced so much that the
spillover effect prevails over the substitutability effect, and ﬁrms are motivated to
expand output. The curve VF ¼ 0 is a watershed of the relationship between qR and qF
which is consistent with the corollary shown in Kamien et al. (1992)12.
12
They demonstrate the price (output) in R&D cartelization is less (more) than the price in R&D
stems from the variation of competition intensity13. Under regime R, upstream
collusion leads to much more ﬁerce rivalry in non-cooperative output stage.
Furthermore, since ﬁrms collude in output under regime P, the market becomes
looser, and the ﬁrms have more incentives to increase the price by reducing output.
We ﬁnd also that the ﬁrms colluding in output produce less than the ﬁrms
competing in production market when the goods are sufﬁciently differentiated
(zones I, II, III). First, the downstream output cooperation induces ﬁrms to increase
the price and decrease the output; second, as the low value for c generates the small
spillovers, the R&D efforts exerted by ﬁrm i cannot sufﬁciently reduce its rival ’s
marginal cost, this spillover effect is not strong enough to compensate the decrease
in output due to production cooperation, therefore, ﬁrms have to shrink output.
3.3 Proﬁt
According to Brod and Shivakumar (1999)14 (henceforth, ‘‘BS’’), the proﬁt under
Full Competition could be greater than under Semi-collusion in Production in some
cases. When there is the ‘‘close relationship’’ between product differentiation and
R&D spillovers, we have the following result:
Result 3
(i)
(ii)
(iii)

13

The ﬁrms in Full Collusion are most proﬁtable while the ﬁrms in Full
Competition are least proﬁtable.
When ﬁrms adopt similar technologies (concavity), they prefer taking part
in R&D Cartel to joining in Production Cartel (cf. Fig. 5, red area).
When ﬁrms adopt different technologies (convexity), the ﬁrms in Production Cartel could generate more proﬁt than that in R&D Cartel (cf. green
area pP [ pR and white area pP \pR ).

See Fershtman and Gandal (1994).

14

In an one-stage game, cartels increase industry proﬁts and exacerbate the consumer surplus. In a model
where ﬁrms collude in production, but compete in R&D, the cartel members may be worse off and
consumers better off due to over-investment by ﬁrms eager to improve their position in the cartel. Brod
and Shivakumar (1999) analyze a two-stage model and examine the effect of semi-collusion when the
non-production activity is R&D. Firms choose their R&D effort in a ﬁrst stage and output in a second
stage. They shed light on the fact that in the presence of spillovers, ﬁrms and consumers could be both
better off, peradventure both worse off, by a semi-collusive production cartel. We are attired by this
fascinating outcome. Thereupon, we try to approach the in-depth analysis and understand the driving
forces of this result. We ﬁnd, however, that the ﬁndings of Brod and Shivakumar (1999) are disputable.
The incorrect SPNE values of per-ﬁrm R&D effort, output and proﬁt due to improper handling result in
the inaccuracy of their main propositions. When the goods are sufﬁciently substitutable, the proposition 1
does not hold. In other words, there is no absolute predominance of production cartel in terms of R&D
effort. Since the optimum equilibrium of cartel at the production stage could be negative for certain
combination parameters (the degree of product differentiation and the level of spillovers), we ﬁnd the
region D depicted as ‘‘Consumers prefer Production Cartel; ﬁrms prefer Competition’’ could not always
satisfy the conditions mentioned in proposition 2. In ‘‘Appendix 2’’, we focus upon their calculative

Proof

The equilibrium individual ﬁrm’s proﬁts are arranged:
pM [ max ½pP ; pR  [ min ½pP ; pR  [ pF 8 c; h
pM [ pR [ pP [ pF 8 c if h\1
h

When the spillover is relative to the product differentiation, the proﬁt of the ﬁrms
in the regime P always prevails over the one in the regime F. This result is in
contrast with Brod and Shivakumar (1999) which shows that the proﬁt under regime
F could be higher than under regime P. Furthermore, in line with semi-collusion
literature (Matsui 1989; Fershtman and Gandal 1994), we establish the possibility
that R&D Cartel is less proﬁtable than Production Cartel.
We ﬁnd that the proﬁt of ﬁrms with fully cooperative behavior prevails over onedimension cooperation proﬁt which is higher than the proﬁt earned by the ﬁrm in
(Production Cartel or R&D Cartel) will be more beneﬁcial for ﬁrms.
Consider D as the difference of proﬁts in two semi-collusion scenarios:
D ¼ pP À pR

ð20Þ

We examine the proﬁt ranking with the same method used in the previous subsection. The result is illustrated in Fig. 5. The interesting conclusion which emerges
from this ﬁgure is that both Semi-collusion in R&D and Semi-collusion in Production can yield more proﬁt.
Under concave relationship (technological proximity), ﬁrms colluding in R&D
generate always more proﬁt than ﬁrms colluding in output. The intuition of this
result is the following: compared to the regime P, the distinctive advantage of the
regime R is that ﬁrms invest more in R&D under concave relationship (See
Result 1), thereby, ﬁrms are more competitive due to cost-saving by R&D
investment; furthermore, according to Result 2, ﬁrms in the regime R produce more
than ﬁrms in the regime P. Despite the fact that R&D investment is expensive, the
proﬁt of the ﬁrms in the regime R is still higher than that in the regime P when h\1.
The inverse outcome pP [ pR can take place for some plausible c under
convexity condition (technological alienation). In particular, when h is approximately greater than the critical value which is equal to 1:12, pP [ pR holds
always true.
3.4 Social welfare
In general, the welfare is damaged by collusion: in one-stage game, the collusion
always harms the welfare; whereas in two-stage game where ﬁrms ﬁrst choose R&D
efforts, collusion reduces welfare if it occurs in each of the two stages15. We
determine which regime is the most relevant with regard to aggregate surplus
(Fig. 6).

Full Collusion can generate the highest level in social welfare, in particular
when ﬁrms produce the similar goods (cf. Fig. 6, green area).
When ﬁrms produce the differentiated goods (red area), Semi-collusion in
R&D enhances most the social welfare.
Based on Fig. 6, the social welfare ranking will be:

WF [ WR [ WP [ WM
WR [ WF [ WP [ WM

WR [ WM [ WF [ WP

W R [ W M [ W P [ W F (zone V)
W M [ W R [ W F [ W P (zone VI)
W M [ W R [ W P [ W F (zone VII)
h

We highlight that the collusive behavior in both stages could enhance the welfare
(zones VI, VII). If we consider the social welfare equilibrium level in the Full
Competition regime as the criterion value, not only the Full Collusion regime but
also Semi-collusion can improve the welfare. For example, the regime R is the
welfare dominant regime when products are sufﬁciently differentiated. We ﬁnd also
under concavity condition, ﬁrms colluding in R&D regardless of their production
strategy always enhance more social welfare than ﬁrms colluding in output
independently of R&D strategy. Semi-collusion in Production can lead to a decrease
consumer surplus (output) which are depicted in Sect. 3.2 (Result 2), it is clear that
there are some points of dissimilarity, such as the location of the different zones and
the size of zones. In virtue of this dissimilarity, the discussion on antitrust policy is
unsealed. In what follows, we focus on the difference between consumer welfare
standard and total welfare standard.
3.5 Merger control: consumer welfare standard Vs total welfare standard
On the basis of Result 4, we conclude that society can beneﬁt from not only the
cooperative behavior in one dimension (Semi-collusion in R&D or in Production)
but also from the horizontal merger (Full Collusion). Therefore, all regimes can
yield the highest level of welfare for plausible parameter combinations.
Nowadays, most countries have laws or regulations that require competition
authorities to scrutinize horizontal mergers. These authorities normally do not
examine whether a particular merger is likely to affect welfare because it substantially
lessens competition (USA) or signiﬁcantly impedes effective competition (European
Union). The US or EU applies a consumer welfare criteria to mergers. Canada,
Australia and New Zealand, however, consider a merger’s effects on aggregate surplus
and had a very explicit aggregate surplus standard (Motta 2004).
Consequently, we make use of both total welfare standard and consumer welfare
standard within our framework, to analyze the difference between two abovementioned criteria, to examine whether the merger prohibited under aggregate
welfare standard can be authorized under consumer welfare standard or inversely.
From the perspective of competition policy, the regimes Full Competition and
Semi-collusion in R&D are considered as benchmarks. The competition authorities
authorize the merger satisfying the following condition using total welfare standard:
W M [ maxfW F ; W R g

ð21Þ

using consumer welfare standard:
CSM [ maxfCSF ; CSR g

ð22Þ

In Fig. 7, on the right side of curve Consumer Welfare Standard, the horizontal
merger is accepted by consumer welfare standard. Total welfare standard authorizes
the merger when the beach of parameter combination locates to the right of the
curve named Total Welfare Standard. It is straightforward that there is the gap
(dashed area) between two mentioned curves which sheds light on the looseness of
the total welfare standard and the preciseness of the consumer surplus standard. Due
to the prohibition by competition authorities, in the left side, the ﬁrms have to lean
to the less attracting regimes which yield less proﬁt compared to merger one.
Therefore, the ﬁrms prefer the Semi-collusion in R&D (semi-collusion16) in the
prohibited merger zone (pR [ pF ).
16
Note that in reality, the Production Cartel is prohibited. Thus, we exclude it in antitrust control

4 Concluding remarks
In the traditional one-dimensional framework, collusion increases producer proﬁts,
but damages consumer welfare without ambiguity (Textbook17 view). However, this
argument ignores the effects of other non-production activities, such as R&D.
Recently, as shown in Revisionist18 view, within two-dimensional game, semicollusion may be proﬁtable and efﬁcient (Brod and Shivakumar 1999) under some
circumstances, while it can be unproﬁtable and inefﬁcient. Previous works have

17

The textbook view: while the ﬁrms beneﬁt from product market collusion, consumer welfare is higher
under non-cooperation in the product market. See more in Jacquemin and Slade (1989).
18
The revisionist view: if the ﬁrms have the options for non-production activities, such as R&D, before
production, producers can be worse off and consumers can be better off. See more in Matsui (1989),
cooperation depends particularly on product differentiation and R&D spillovers.
This paper emphasizes the ‘‘close relationship’’ between product differentiation
and spillovers, and studies the signiﬁcative relevance in the scenarios where ﬁrms
can either coordinate their decisions or adopt non-cooperative strategy (Full
Competition, Full Collusion and Semi-collusion regimes) at each stage. Kamien
et al. (1992) claim that the investment by ﬁrms engaged in the regime R is
unambiguously greater than that in the regime F irrespective of spillovers. We
demonstrate in fact which regime generates more R&D effort in equilibrium
depends upon both the degree of product differentiation and the technological
distance. If we restrict our attention to the concave relationship, the ranking of R&D
efforts is unalterable and independent of the product differentiation, competitions at
the upstream stage depress R&D investment. Firms colluding in R&D regardless of
their production strategy always yield more proﬁt and generate higher social welfare
than ﬁrms colluding in output independently of R&D strategy. When products are
close substitutes, Full Collusion is a welfare-enhancing regime.
In addition, a discussion about antitrust policy is carried out. By focusing upon
the distinctness of different antitrust criteria, this framework sheds light on the
looseness of the total welfare standard and the preciseness of the consumer welfare
standard. This outcome will be veriﬁed, in future work, by considering the
interaction between Competition Authorities and ﬁrms, in a context of asymmetric
information19.
There are some possible extensions of this framework: ﬁrst, we will check the
robustness of the result obtained in this paper, when there would be more than two
ﬁrms in the market; second, we will investigate whether our model can get the
similar results within a dynamic20 duopoly game, by supposing the R&D
investments for cost-reducing innovation over continuous time; third, the parameter
of spillover depends only on the degree of product differentiation in this model,
however, the government can control the parameter of spillover using the
intellectual property right policy, and it is an important extension of this model
to enrich the policy implication; fourth, the degree of product differentiation is
exogenously given in our model, however, ﬁrms have strategic incentives to control
to maximize their proﬁt, and it is better to consider the case that the degree of
product differentiation is determined endogenously.

Abstract The paper investigates ﬁrms’ behavior and outcomes (levels of costreducing R&D, output, proﬁt and welfare in equilibrium) in a differentiated duopoly
with process innovation. One of the important features in this paper is that spillovers
operate in the R&D stage and are tied to the degree of product substitutability as
well as the extent of technological proximity/alienation of the research paths leading
to cost reduction. Using this feature, the paper tries to explore and compare four
separate organization setups (Full Competition, Semi-collusion in Production, Semicollusion in R&D and Full Collusion). It is found that under technological proximity, competitions at the upstream stage depress R&D investment, and ﬁrms
colluding in R&D regardless of their production strategy always yield more proﬁt
and generate higher social welfare than ﬁrms colluding in output; under technological alienation, R&D cooperation may reduce ﬁrms’ interest to invest in R&D,
and it is possible that ﬁrms in the Full Collusion regime produce most and generate
the highest level of social welfare.

Institute for quantitative economics, Research center for the applied statistics and big data,
Nowadays, economies in Latin America are becoming more and more knowledge
based. Innovation becomes essential to spur economic growth and to raise living
standards. At the ﬁrm level, either competition or collusion could reward innovation
by providing strong incentives for ﬁrms to be more efﬁcient than their rivals. This
paper aims to study the extent to which innovation incentives in a duopoly change
according to the extent of product substitutability and the ‘‘technological distance’’
of ﬁrms. We draw particular attention to ﬁrms’ (full/partial) collusive behavior and
attempt to address the following questions: What type of collusion (partial, full,
none) should ﬁrms choose, and which one is more conducive to technological
advancement and a ﬁrm’s growth? How do ﬁrms choose different types of collusion,
and how do these affect market outcomes? Can the collusive strategy improve the
consumer surplus and the social welfare, and which one serves best?
Innovation through R&D investment leads to more efﬁcient use of resources,
creating sustainable competitive advantages. The most important aspect of R&D
investment is the externality (spillovers) which has been studied through the
divergence between the social and private returns of production process. The public
goods feature of knowledge generates spillovers which allow others to use the
owner’s innovation free of charge. Due to the spillover effect, the rate of return from
an innovation is lesser and as a result, the incentives for carrying out R&D are
reduced. The individual ﬁrm fears that competitors use its internal research results
and thus probably increase their proﬁts without having to bear the expenses.
Therefore, the researching ﬁrm will only have limited incentive to invest in R&D.
However, from the collective viewpoint, spillovers strengthen the dissemination of
new knowledge available for the whole society, and improve the social welfare
(Amir 2000).
Within a game where ﬁrms are ﬁrst engaged in costly research efforts to adopt a
lower-cost technology and then compete in a Cournot fashion with homogeneous
products, (D’Aspremont and Jacquemin 1988) (henceforth ‘‘AJ’’) show that ﬁrms
invest more under R&D cooperation than under R&D competition for sufﬁciently
high spillover effects (full competition versus full cooperation). Kamien et al.
(1992) (henceforth ‘‘KMZ’’) extend the AJ model to a more general framework with
product differentiation and allow ﬁrms to participate in a research joint venture
(RJV). They show that ﬁrms should be encouraged to form a RJV only if they
coordinate their R&D decisions while maintaining competition for sales. Concerning the welfare effects of cooperative R&D with spillovers, cooperation raises social
welfare when the spillover is high (Suzumura 1992).
Compared to aforementioned works, this paper emphasizes the ‘‘close relationship’’ between product differentiation and R&D spillovers. The key feature is to
consider that the extent of product differentiation determines the ability of a ﬁrm to
appropriate its rival’s R&D effort. In addition, this ability is inﬂuenced by the
sensibility of spillovers relative to product differentiation, in other words,
technological distance. Several explanations can be provided to justify this ‘‘close
production technique resulting from rival’s R&D effort. Second, the exchange of
technological information between engineers of competing ﬁrms is recognized as an
important source of R&D spillovers (Severinov 2001). Spillovers are believed to be
higher between technological neighbors. According to this view, the ability to make
productive use of another ﬁrm’s knowledge depends on the degree of technological
distance between ﬁrms. Every technology has a somewhat unique set of applications
and language. Researchers in similar technological ﬁelds will interact in professional organizations, publish in commonly read journals, and, increasingly, browse
a common set of web pages. It is natural to consider that the dissemination of
technological knowledge across competing ﬁrms is strong when ﬁrms’ technologies
are similar. Furthermore, the above-mentioned ‘‘close relationship’’ is divided into
two categories: concave relationship (technological proximity) where ﬁrms adopt
similar technologies (i.e., the similar smart phones produced by Apple, Blackberry,
Nokia ...), convex relationship (technological alienation) where ﬁrms adopt
different technologies (i.e., electricity can be produced by different technologies).
To be more concrete, we take the electricity production, for example, electric power
companies are differentiated by voltages, a commercial consumer may need a
voltage level of 11 kV or 440 V while a residential consumer needs power at level
of 240 V, this difference of voltages refers to product differentiation. The electricity
can be produced by different technologies (i.e., solar panels, wind turbines, nuclear
energy), this refers to the extent of technological distance. The R&D ﬂow between
companies employing the same output (voltage) and the same technique is
obviously greater.
In location models, the distance between ﬁrms determines the degree of product
differentiation. By considering that R&D spillover depends negatively on ﬁrms’
product location, it is shown that R&D effort is positively associated with the
differentiation of products1 (Piga and Poyago-Theotoky 2005). However, they do
not address the important issue of cooperative behavior between ﬁrms in their
models.
In this paper, we consider a two-stage game where ﬁrms with heterogeneous
products competing in a Cournot fashion engage in upstream R&D and downstream
production. At each stage, the competing ﬁrms can either coordinate their decisions
or adopt non-cooperative strategy. This assumption allows us to compare the Subgame Perfect Nash Equilibrium (henceforth ‘‘SPNE’’) emerging in the four separate
scenarios : full competition, semi-collusion in Production2, Semi-collusion in R&D3
and Full Collusion4. Compared to Kamien et al. (1992) which claim that the R&D
investment by ﬁrms engaged in Semi-collusion in R&D is unambiguously greater
than that in the Full Competition regime irrespective of spillovers, we demonstrate
in fact which regime generates more R&D effort in equilibrium depends upon both

restrict our attention to the concave relationship, Full Collusion participants spend
most on R&D, and Semi-collusion participants spend more than ﬁrms in the Full
Competition regime. This ranking of R&D efforts is unalterable and independent of
the product differentiation, and the competition at the upstream stage depresses
R&D investment. Firms colluding in R&D regardless of their production strategy
always yield more proﬁt and generate higher social welfare than ﬁrms colluding in
output independently of R&D strategy. When products are close substitutes, the
synergy effects prevail over the anti-competitive effects due to the high spillovers,
Full Collusion becomes a welfare-enhancing regime. Focusing on the convex
relationship, R&D cooperation may reduce ﬁrms’ interest to invest in R&D, and it is
possible that ﬁrms in the Full Collusion regime produce most and generate the
highest level of social welfare. Furthermore, horizontal mergers might be
interpreted as a Full Collusion where the participants coordinate their decisions
with respect to all of strategic variables. Thus, we launch the discussion about
antitrust policy, and shed light on the leniency of the total welfare standard and the
restrictiveness of the consumer welfare standard.
The rest of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents the model and
solves the SPNE in the four alternative regimes. We compare R&D effort, proﬁt,
consumer surplus and social welfare according to ﬁrms’ behavior (competitive or
collusive) in Sect. 3. Section 4 concludes this paper.

2 The model
2.1 Hypothesis
Consider an industry with two ﬁrms producing imperfectly substitutable goods. The
representative consumer has a quasi-linear utility function
1
Uðqi ; qj Þ ¼ aðqi þ qj Þ À ðq2 þ q2 þ 2cqi qj Þ
j
2 i

ð1Þ

where ‘‘qi ’’ is the output of ﬁrm i; ‘‘a’’ is a constant which is assumed to be
sufﬁciently large so that all ﬁrms product positive amounts in equilibrium; ‘‘c’’
measures the substitutability5 between the products and c 2 ½0; 1Þ. The utility
function generates the following inverse demand function faced by ﬁrm i:
pi ðqi ; qj Þ ¼ a À qi À cqj

ð2Þ

The production technology exhibits a constant marginal cost ‘‘c’’ which can be
reduced by investing in R&D. Due to spillovers (b), the R&D effort not only leads
to a decrease in its own marginal cost, but also reduces the marginal cost of the rival

5

If c ¼ 0, ﬁrms’ products are not substitutable and each ﬁrm acts as a monopolist. Note that, when
products are perfect substitutes, the spillover obviously equals to 1 and the game cannot be solved. See
marginal cost is
Ci ðxi ; xj Þ ¼ c À xi À bxj

ð3Þ

The R&D cost is assumed to be quadratic (1 x2 ), which reﬂects the decreasing
2 i
returns to R&D effort.
The individual proﬁt of ﬁrm i is deﬁned by
À
Á
1
pi ¼ pi ðqi ; qj Þ À Ci ðxi ; xj Þ qi À x2
2 i

with i 6¼ j; i; j ¼ 1; 2

ð4Þ

The social welfare is the sum of producer surplus (denoted by PS) and consumer
surplus (denoted by CS):
W ¼ PS þ CS

with PS ¼ pi þ pj ; CS ¼ U À pi qi À pj qj

ð5Þ

The key feature of the model is to consider that the extent of product substitutability
(c) determines the ability of a ﬁrm to appropriate its rival’ R&D effort. When
products are less differentiated, competing ﬁrms share closer technological spaces,
and one ﬁrm can beneﬁt more from the rival’s effort. We assume that the relationship between the spillover parameter (b) and the degree of product differentiation (c) is described by:
!
1 3
bðc; hÞ ¼ ch with h 2 ; ; c 2 ½0; 1Þ
ð6Þ
2 2
where the parameter ‘‘h’’ determines both the sensibility of the R&D spillover to the
degree of product differentiation, in other words, the measure of technological
distance6, and the level of spillovers for a given value of differentiation (see Fig. 1).
The assumption h 2 ½1 ; 3 is necessary to guarantee the equilibrium existence in the
2 2
four alternative scenarios. The range of h permits us to touch upon the issue of
concavity (technological proximity, h\1) and convexity (technological alienation,
h [ 1). As ob [ 0 and ob \0, we incur that, for any given value of c, the concave
oc
oh
relationship implies a more important spillover effect than the convex relationship.
From the perspective of technological distance, the concavity refers to the situations
where ﬁrms adopt similar technologies. Under concavity condition, the more differentiated are the products (close to 0), R&D spillovers are more sensitive to c. One
can imagine that the concavity (h\1) corresponds to industries that are geographically concentrated and that rely upon sources of basic scientiﬁc knowledge or
general purpose technologies (GPT) in the cluster7 beneﬁt most from the exchange
of knowledge and technology. By contrast, under convexity condition, the less
differentiated are products (close to 1), the more sensitive R&D spillovers with
respect to c, and the convexity delineates the situations where ﬁrms adopt different
technologies.
6

From the perspective of technological distance, it is straightforward that the more technologies are
similar, the greater are spillovers, for a given level of product differentiation.

We consider a two-stage game where ﬁrms act simultaneously at each stage.
Firms select a strategic action (R&D effort) at the ﬁrst stage anticipating correctly
its impact at the second stage. The two competing ﬁrms can either coordinate their
decisions or adopt non-cooperative strategy at each stage. When ﬁrms collude in
one dimension (R&D or production) and compete in another one, such behavior is
called semi-collusion (Fershtman and Gandal 1994). We compare the SPNE
emerging in the four alternative scenarios (Table 1) such as Full Competition, Semicollusion in Production, Semi-collusion in R&D and Full Collusion.
2.2 Sub-game equilibrium in the four regimes
2.2.1 Full competition
We begin with regime F, where there is no cooperation in any of the stages. The
SPNE is obtained by backward induction. Firm i chooses output qi to maximize
individual proﬁt pi , and the ﬁrm i’s output as a function of R&D efforts is given by:

When the technological distance is large enough (h [ 1 þ log 2 ), the technologies

Despite the ostensibly widespread use of Full Collusion to exploit the complementarities in ﬁrm’s R&D process, the formal literature on R&D has almost focus
exclusively on research joint venture, whereby ﬁrms share out technological
knowledge (b ¼ 1) while continuing to compete against each other in product
market (see Kamien et al. 1992).8 Here, we regard this scenario as the framework of
multi-dimensional coordination in which ﬁrms cooperate in both R&D and
production stages. Since, the products are imperfectly substitutable, Full Collusion9
means that the ﬁrms maximize their joint proﬁt in each stage.

In the following section, we will compare these four aforementioned regimes in
terms of signiﬁcative relevance such as R&D investment, proﬁt, consumer surplus
and social welfare.

3 Comparison of different regimes
3.1 R&D effort
We start with the comparison of R&D investment level and address the question:
which regime generates the highest level of R&D effort in equilibrium? To compare
individual levels of R&D under different regimes, let us deﬁne the functions fk ðc; hÞ,
gk ðc; hÞ and jF ðc; hÞ

8

Kamien et al. (1992) provide a thorough analysis of RJV, contrasting the case of RJV Competition
where ﬁrms pool R&D results, but behave non-cooperatively at both stages, and RJV Cartelization (the
pooling of R&D results with cooperative determination of R&D investment, but competition in
subsequent product market stage). Suzumura (1992) and Suzumura and Yanagawa (1993) contain a
closely related analysis. D’Aspremont and Jacquemin (1988) do allow for merger under which ﬁrms pool
R&D results and cooperate in both stage of the game. It is worth noting that there are the analysis of the
converse case to RJV, where all ﬁrms compete in R&D stage, but then collude in outputs, see Fershtman
and Gandal (1994) and Brod and Shivakumar (1999).

We plot the curves fk ðc; hÞ ¼ 0, gk ðc; hÞ ¼ 0, jF ðc; hÞ ¼ 0 in c and h space and this
pattern implies the ranking of R&D efforts into ﬁve zones (Fig. 2).

When ﬁrms have same behavior in the upstream stage, the downstream
cooperation can incite ﬁrms to exert more R&D investment.
When ﬁrms adopt different technologies and produce differentiated goods
(cf. Fig. 2, green area), the ﬁrms colluding in production will invest most in
R&D.


Under technological proximity, ﬁrms with two-stage cooperation have most
incentive to invest in R&D without ambiguity.

First of all, we ﬁnd when ﬁrms have same behavior (cooperation or competition)
in the upstream R&D stage, ﬁrms allowed to cooperate in the product market always
exert more R&D efforts in equilibrium, compared to ﬁrms competing in the
downstream stage (xM [ xR and xP [ xF 8 c; h). As we know, R&D efforts reduce
the marginal cost and indirectly lead to a decrease of the product price. When ﬁrms
can collude in the downstream stage, they restrict their outputs for a given R&D
effort and as a consequence, the negative impact of R&D efforts on the product
price is alleviated. Conversely, an intense product competition dissipates the
beneﬁts of R&D effort and, therefore, shrinks the incentive to invest in R&D. The
output cooperation has a positive impact on R&D investment and then induces ﬁrms
to undertake more R&D than they would under competition in the downstream
stage.
The output cooperation reinforces the R&D effort for a given behavior at
upstream stage. However, when the behavior at downstream stage is given, the
R&D cooperation does not unambiguously increase research efforts. If we compare
the regime F with the regime R (corresponding, respectively, to the lowest level in
terms of R&D effort), it is found that R&D cooperation could be detrimental to
R&D effort in zone I and zone II. This ﬁnding is in sharp contrast with the existing
literature, for instance, Kamien et al. (1992) show that xR is unambiguously greater
than xF without taking into account the close relationship emphasized in this paper.
The striking outcome we ﬁnd here is that R&D investment under regime P can be
the largest (cf. Fig. 2, green area). It is different from the conventional wisdom that
merged (two-stage cooperation) ﬁrms have more incentive to invest in R&D,
because they appropriate all of the R&D efforts. The spillover effect (in zones I,II
and III) constitutes a positive, but very small externality. When ﬁrms cooperate in
the upstream stage (regimes M, R), on the one hand this small externality is
internalized, on the other hand the R&D cooperation cannot promote the spending
on common research of ﬁrms due to technological alienation (convexity). However,
Semi-collusion in Production can intensify the R&D competition by production
cooperation, and incites ﬁrms to invest more in R&D. Therefore, the regime P leads
R&D spillover is concave (red area), the ranking of R&D efforts
(xM [ xR [ xP [ xF ) does not alter, and it is independent of the product
differentiation. It means that the Full Collusion participants spend more on R&D
than Semi-collusion ones, under concave relationship (technological proximity).
From the aggregate surplus point of view, the welfare performance of R&D
investment in the different scenarios can be gauged, and we compare them with the
First-Best welfare criterion (Suzumura 1992). ‘‘Appendix 1’’ provides the proof of
the expression xFB :
xFB ¼

Að1 þ ch Þ
ð1 þ cÞ À ð1 þ ch Þ2

ð17Þ

Obviously, xFB is the signiﬁcant standard accessing whether the R&D investment is
efﬁcient, when the denominator ð1 þ cÞ À ð1 þ ch Þ2 is positive.

emphasize the area xFB [ maxfxF ; xR ; xP ; xM g. The smooth curve xFB ¼ 0 divides
the pattern into two parts and the left one represents xFB [ 0. The intersection area
between the smooth curve and the zigzag curve (xFB ¼ xP ) deﬁnes combinations of
c and h where xP [ xFB . D’Aspremont and Jacquemin (1988) and Henriques (1990)
show that the social optimum R&D effort was unambiguously greater than the level
of R&D investment in equilibrium under the fully cooperative or non-cooperative or
mixed10 game. Compared to them, we ﬁnd the similar result when ﬁrms produce
sufﬁciently heterogeneous goods. Furthermore, it is worthwhile to note xP can be
higher than xFB in an inﬁnitesimal area where a higher level of R&D effort
corresponds to a wasteful duplication.
3.2 Output and consumer surplus
Due to symmetric equilibria, output is considered as an index of consumer surplus
ðCSk ¼ ð1 þ cÞðqk Þ2 with k ¼ fF; P; R; MgÞ. We trace out the meaningful areas by
plotting the following curves:

The level of output and consumer welfare in fully cooperative scenario can
be higher (cf. Fig. 4, green area) than that in partially cooperative or fully
non-cooperative situations.
When ﬁrms adopt similar technologies (concavity), R&D cooperation
(regimes M and R) encourages ﬁrms to produce more, and leads to ﬁerce
output competition.
Firms under Full Competition can produce most and achieve the highest
level of consumer welfare (red area), if and only if they use very different
technologies and produce highly differentiated goods.

is arranged in the following form

Apart from Semi-collusion in Production, each regime can yield the highest level
of output (consumer surplus) for plausible parameter combinations. When ﬁrms
produce sufﬁciently similar goods, the Full Collusion regime ensures the highest
level (green area). This ﬁnding is in contrast with the traditional literature ‘‘the ﬁrms
under Full Competition always produce more than the ﬁrms under Full Collusion
scenarios’’11. The reason behind this is the substitutability–spillover relationship:
11

D’Aspremont and Jacquemin (1988) and Henriques (1990) demonstrate the level of output in noncooperative two-stage case is always higher than that in fully cooperative situation. In addition, they
claim that the mixed game can generate more output than non-cooperative two-stage game for large
spillovers, on the other hand, it induces ﬁrms under Full Collusion to spend more on
R&D (Result 1), accordingly the marginal cost of Full Collusion participants is
sufﬁciently reduced, ﬁrms under Full Collusion have interest to expand their output.
We also ﬁnd that the output level is the highest in the regime R when the goods are
sufﬁciently differentiated (zones II,III,IV,V). Furthermore, if the sensibility
parameter h is comparatively large (technological alienation), Full Competition
generates the highest output level (zone I). The reason of the instable relationship
between qR and qM arises from the sensibility of output to R&D effort: in the
symmetric equilibria, the sensibility under regime R and M is, respectively, given by
oqR 2 À chþ1 þ 2ch À c

It is found that oqR [ oqM , this inequality discloses that the output in the regime R is
ox
ox
more sensitive to R&D effort compared to the one in the regime M. In addition,
xM [ xR holds true at all time (Result 1). Indeed, qM can be greater than qR in some
zones (VI and VII).
There is no stable hierarchy because the impact of R&D effort is complicated and
exerts two conﬂicting effects on the output of rival ﬁrm. On the one hand, R&D effort is
managed to induce the ﬁrm to expand output at expense of its rival by cutting down its
own production cost. It is considered as the substitutability effect (an increase in its own
output leads to a decrease in rival’s output) which is greater, the more substitutable the
products are. On the other hand, the R&D effort can reduce the rival ﬁrm’s cost, thereby
increase its rival ﬁrm’s output. It is regarded as the spillover effect (boosting rival’s
output) which is greater the larger the spillover is. Since the spillover depends
positively on the degree of product differentiation, when products are quasi
homogeneous, both substitutability effect and spillover effect enlarge. Whether the
output (consumer surplus) increases depends on the interplay of these two conﬂicting
effects. If the spillover effect prevails over the substitutability effect, ﬁrms are
motivated to expand output; otherwise, they prefer to shrink output.
According to Fig. 4, it is clear that ﬁrms colluding in R&D produce more than ﬁrms
competing on R&D (qR ; qM [ qP ; qF ) when the relationship between substitutability
and spillover is concave (h\1). This result holds always true regardless of product
differentiation. Under the circumstance that the leakage of know-how is relatively
strong (concave relationship), ﬁrms cooperating on R&D are willing to spend more on
R&D efforts (Result 1), the marginal costs of both ﬁrms are reduced so much that the
spillover effect prevails over the substitutability effect, and ﬁrms are motivated to
expand output. The curve VF ¼ 0 is a watershed of the relationship between qR and qF
which is consistent with the corollary shown in Kamien et al. (1992)12.
12
They demonstrate the price (output) in R&D cartelization is less (more) than the price in R&D
stems from the variation of competition intensity13. Under regime R, upstream
collusion leads to much more ﬁerce rivalry in non-cooperative output stage.
Furthermore, since ﬁrms collude in output under regime P, the market becomes
looser, and the ﬁrms have more incentives to increase the price by reducing output.
We ﬁnd also that the ﬁrms colluding in output produce less than the ﬁrms
competing in production market when the goods are sufﬁciently differentiated
(zones I, II, III). First, the downstream output cooperation induces ﬁrms to increase
the price and decrease the output; second, as the low value for c generates the small
spillovers, the R&D efforts exerted by ﬁrm i cannot sufﬁciently reduce its rival ’s
marginal cost, this spillover effect is not strong enough to compensate the decrease
in output due to production cooperation, therefore, ﬁrms have to shrink output.
3.3 Proﬁt
According to Brod and Shivakumar (1999)14 (henceforth, ‘‘BS’’), the proﬁt under
Full Competition could be greater than under Semi-collusion in Production in some
cases. When there is the ‘‘close relationship’’ between product differentiation and
R&D spillovers, we have the following result:
Result 3
(i)
(ii)
(iii)

13

The ﬁrms in Full Collusion are most proﬁtable while the ﬁrms in Full
Competition are least proﬁtable.
When ﬁrms adopt similar technologies (concavity), they prefer taking part
in R&D Cartel to joining in Production Cartel (cf. Fig. 5, red area).
When ﬁrms adopt different technologies (convexity), the ﬁrms in Production Cartel could generate more proﬁt than that in R&D Cartel (cf. green
area pP [ pR and white area pP \pR ).

See Fershtman and Gandal (1994).

14

In an one-stage game, cartels increase industry proﬁts and exacerbate the consumer surplus. In a model
where ﬁrms collude in production, but compete in R&D, the cartel members may be worse off and
consumers better off due to over-investment by ﬁrms eager to improve their position in the cartel. Brod
and Shivakumar (1999) analyze a two-stage model and examine the effect of semi-collusion when the
non-production activity is R&D. Firms choose their R&D effort in a ﬁrst stage and output in a second
stage. They shed light on the fact that in the presence of spillovers, ﬁrms and consumers could be both
better off, peradventure both worse off, by a semi-collusive production cartel. We are attired by this
fascinating outcome. Thereupon, we try to approach the in-depth analysis and understand the driving
forces of this result. We ﬁnd, however, that the ﬁndings of Brod and Shivakumar (1999) are disputable.
The incorrect SPNE values of per-ﬁrm R&D effort, output and proﬁt due to improper handling result in
the inaccuracy of their main propositions. When the goods are sufﬁciently substitutable, the proposition 1
does not hold. In other words, there is no absolute predominance of production cartel in terms of R&D
effort. Since the optimum equilibrium of cartel at the production stage could be negative for certain
combination parameters (the degree of product differentiation and the level of spillovers), we ﬁnd the
region D depicted as ‘‘Consumers prefer Production Cartel; ﬁrms prefer Competition’’ could not always
satisfy the conditions mentioned in proposition 2. In ‘‘Appendix 2’’, we focus upon their calculative

Proof

The equilibrium individual ﬁrm’s proﬁts are arranged:
pM [ max ½pP ; pR  [ min ½pP ; pR  [ pF 8 c; h
pM [ pR [ pP [ pF 8 c if h\1
h

When the spillover is relative to the product differentiation, the proﬁt of the ﬁrms
in the regime P always prevails over the one in the regime F. This result is in
contrast with Brod and Shivakumar (1999) which shows that the proﬁt under regime
F could be higher than under regime P. Furthermore, in line with semi-collusion
literature (Matsui 1989; Fershtman and Gandal 1994), we establish the possibility
that R&D Cartel is less proﬁtable than Production Cartel.
We ﬁnd that the proﬁt of ﬁrms with fully cooperative behavior prevails over onedimension cooperation proﬁt which is higher than the proﬁt earned by the ﬁrm in
(Production Cartel or R&D Cartel) will be more beneﬁcial for ﬁrms.
Consider D as the difference of proﬁts in two semi-collusion scenarios:
D ¼ pP À pR

ð20Þ

We examine the proﬁt ranking with the same method used in the previous subsection. The result is illustrated in Fig. 5. The interesting conclusion which emerges
from this ﬁgure is that both Semi-collusion in R&D and Semi-collusion in Production can yield more proﬁt.
Under concave relationship (technological proximity), ﬁrms colluding in R&D
generate always more proﬁt than ﬁrms colluding in output. The intuition of this
result is the following: compared to the regime P, the distinctive advantage of the
regime R is that ﬁrms invest more in R&D under concave relationship (See
Result 1), thereby, ﬁrms are more competitive due to cost-saving by R&D
investment; furthermore, according to Result 2, ﬁrms in the regime R produce more
than ﬁrms in the regime P. Despite the fact that R&D investment is expensive, the
proﬁt of the ﬁrms in the regime R is still higher than that in the regime P when h\1.
The inverse outcome pP [ pR can take place for some plausible c under
convexity condition (technological alienation). In particular, when h is approximately greater than the critical value which is equal to 1:12, pP [ pR holds
always true.
3.4 Social welfare
In general, the welfare is damaged by collusion: in one-stage game, the collusion
always harms the welfare; whereas in two-stage game where ﬁrms ﬁrst choose R&D
efforts, collusion reduces welfare if it occurs in each of the two stages15. We
determine which regime is the most relevant with regard to aggregate surplus
(Fig. 6).

We highlight that the collusive behavior in both stages could enhance the welfare
(zones VI, VII). If we consider the social welfare equilibrium level in the Full
Competition regime as the criterion value, not only the Full Collusion regime but
also Semi-collusion can improve the welfare. For example, the regime R is the
welfare dominant regime when products are sufﬁciently differentiated. We ﬁnd also
under concavity condition, ﬁrms colluding in R&D regardless of their production
strategy always enhance more social welfare than ﬁrms colluding in output
independently of R&D strategy. Semi-collusion in Production can lead to a decrease
consumer surplus (output) which are depicted in Sect. 3.2 (Result 2), it is clear that
there are some points of dissimilarity, such as the location of the different zones and
the size of zones. In virtue of this dissimilarity, the discussion on antitrust policy is
unsealed. In what follows, we focus on the difference between consumer welfare
standard and total welfare standard.
3.5 Merger control: consumer welfare standard Vs total welfare standard
On the basis of Result 4, we conclude that society can beneﬁt from not only the
cooperative behavior in one dimension (Semi-collusion in R&D or in Production)
but also from the horizontal merger (Full Collusion). Therefore, all regimes can
yield the highest level of welfare for plausible parameter combinations.
Nowadays, most countries have laws or regulations that require competition
authorities to scrutinize horizontal mergers. These authorities normally do not
examine whether a particular merger is likely to affect welfare because it substantially
lessens competition (USA) or signiﬁcantly impedes effective competition (European
Union). The US or EU applies a consumer welfare criteria to mergers. Canada,
Australia and New Zealand, however, consider a merger’s effects on aggregate surplus
and had a very explicit aggregate surplus standard (Motta 2004).
Consequently, we make use of both total welfare standard and consumer welfare
standard within our framework, to analyze the difference between two abovementioned criteria, to examine whether the merger prohibited under aggregate
welfare standard can be authorized under consumer welfare standard or inversely.
From the perspective of competition policy, the regimes Full Competition and
Semi-collusion in R&D are considered as benchmarks. The competition authorities
authorize the merger satisfying the following condition using total welfare standard:
W M [ maxfW F ; W R g

ð21Þ

using consumer welfare standard:
CSM [ maxfCSF ; CSR g

ð22Þ

In Fig. 7, on the right side of curve Consumer Welfare Standard, the horizontal
merger is accepted by consumer welfare standard. Total welfare standard authorizes
the merger when the beach of parameter combination locates to the right of the
curve named Total Welfare Standard. It is straightforward that there is the gap
(dashed area) between two mentioned curves which sheds light on the looseness of
the total welfare standard and the preciseness of the consumer surplus standard. Due
to the prohibition by competition authorities, in the left side, the ﬁrms have to lean
to the less attracting regimes which yield less proﬁt compared to merger one.
Therefore, the ﬁrms prefer the Semi-collusion in R&D (semi-collusion16) in the
prohibited merger zone (pR [ pF ).

Note that in reality, the Production Cartel is prohibited. Thus, we exclude it in antitrust control

4 Concluding remarks
In the traditional one-dimensional framework, collusion increases producer proﬁts,
but damages consumer welfare without ambiguity (Textbook17 view). However, this
argument ignores the effects of other non-production activities, such as R&D.
Recently, as shown in Revisionist18 view, within two-dimensional game, semicollusion may be proﬁtable and efﬁcient (Brod and Shivakumar 1999) under some
circumstances, while it can be unproﬁtable and inefﬁcient. Previous works have

17

The textbook view: while the ﬁrms beneﬁt from product market collusion, consumer welfare is higher
under non-cooperation in the product market. See more in Jacquemin and Slade (1989).
18
The revisionist view: if the ﬁrms have the options for non-production activities, such as R&D, before
production, producers can be worse off and consumers can be better off. See more in Matsui (1989),
cooperation depends particularly on product differentiation and R&D spillovers.
This paper emphasizes the ‘‘close relationship’’ between product differentiation
and spillovers, and studies the signiﬁcative relevance in the scenarios where ﬁrms
can either coordinate their decisions or adopt non-cooperative strategy (Full
Competition, Full Collusion and Semi-collusion regimes) at each stage. Kamien
et al. (1992) claim that the investment by ﬁrms engaged in the regime R is
unambiguously greater than that in the regime F irrespective of spillovers. We
demonstrate in fact which regime generates more R&D effort in equilibrium
depends upon both the degree of product differentiation and the technological
distance. If we restrict our attention to the concave relationship, the ranking of R&D
efforts is unalterable and independent of the product differentiation, competitions at
the upstream stage depress R&D investment. Firms colluding in R&D regardless of
their production strategy always yield more proﬁt and generate higher social welfare
than ﬁrms colluding in output independently of R&D strategy. When products are
close substitutes, Full Collusion is a welfare-enhancing regime.
In addition, a discussion about antitrust policy is carried out. By focusing upon
the distinctness of different antitrust criteria, this framework sheds light on the
looseness of the total welfare standard and the preciseness of the consumer welfare
standard. This outcome will be veriﬁed, in future work, by considering the
interaction between Competition Authorities and ﬁrms, in a context of asymmetric
information19.
There are some possible extensions of this framework: ﬁrst, we will check the
robustness of the result obtained in this paper, when there would be more than two
ﬁrms in the market; second, we will investigate whether our model can get the
similar results within a dynamic20 duopoly game, by supposing the R&D
investments for cost-reducing innovation over continuous time; third, the parameter
of spillover depends only on the degree of product differentiation in this model,
however, the government can control the parameter of spillover using the
intellectual property right policy, and it is an important extension of this model
to enrich the policy implication; fourth, the degree of product differentiation is
exogenously given in our model, however, ﬁrms have strategic incentives to control
to maximize their proﬁt, and it is better to consider the case that the degree of
product differentiation is determined endogenously.

Appendix 2: Review of Brod and Shivakumar (1999)
There are two regimes: the one is Competition where ﬁrms compete in both the
R&D and the output markets; the other one is Production Cartel where the ﬁrms
compete in the R&D market, but collude in output market. The superscript ‘‘C’’
stands for Competition and ‘‘P’’ signiﬁes Production Cartel.
The game is solved by backward induction and we characterize the equilibrium
outcomes of this game.

be expressed in the same units as output, they assume bd ¼ 1 to simplify expressions. We ﬁnd whether these two expressions(U,C) are positive or not depends on
the combination of parameters c and b.

R&D effort and output. These errors due to improper handling generate the
distinctive change in the following analysis. Furthermore, BS regard mistakenly
UBS and CBS as the positive terms. Taking UBS as an example, we illustrate here UBS
is negative when

A reappraisal of the main propositions in Brod and Shivakumar (1999).
Proposition 1 Since UBS [ 0, BS claimed the R&D effort in regime Production
Cartel is always signiﬁcant, the ﬁrms colluding in output spared no effort to invest

of the matter is that the U could be negative21 in certain circumscription where the
optimum equilibrium R&D effort is meaningless. We ﬁnd that the member ﬁrm of
cartel could have no interest in R&D processes when the goods are sufﬁciently

stance, the xP will be inferior to xC , then the proposition 1 is not always true.
In addition, Brod and Shivakumar (1999) claimed that ‘‘it is easy to show that as
P

C

Àx
b rises, the difference xP À xC declines’’ in page 226. As a matter of fact, the oðx ob Þ
could be positive. Whether this gap enlarges or shrinks depends upon the
combination of two parameters b and c. To be more legible and intuitionistic, we
illustrate this outcome with the following graphic.

their proposition 1, we have not only the region, corresponding to the ﬁnding of BS,
in which the relative valuation of R&D is reduced as spillovers increase, but also the
region where the gap enlarges following the rise of spillovers. The primary reason
of omitting this positive aspect of b stems from the underestimate of R&D effort in
regime P.
Proposition 2
Brod and Shivakumar (1999) try to compare two mentioned
regimes in terms of both individual and collective incentive. They consider output as
an index of consumer surplus.
