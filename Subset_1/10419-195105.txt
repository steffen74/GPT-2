customer. End user environments, frequency of use are some factors which affect the useful
life of the product. After its useful life, the product is usually disposed to the environment
resulting in pollution, landfill or incineration. So, there is the necessity of evolving some
activities which can control pollution, avoid land filling or incineration and preserve the natural
resources. One such approach is product recovery operation. By the product recovery operation, we can retrieve the retained used value from the used product. Different product recovery
options are repair, reuse, refurbishment, remanufacturing, cannibalization and recycling. Using
these aforesaid options, we can extend the useful life of the product, shown in Fig. 1. The aim
of the useful life extension of the product is to reduce the environmental impact in long run,
while increasing the societal and economic value of the product.
The first step of the product recovery operation is to collect the used products from the end
users. The used products are then sorted, disassembled, repaired or remanufactured,
reassembled and sold in the market. From the literature review, we have identified different
issues which have significant impact in useful life extension of a product. These issues are
clustered into five main groups such as Design of product, Operational issue, Market of
remanufactured product, Government legislation and Environmental Consciousness, shown
in Table 1. The objective of the paper is to study the contextual relationships among the
identified issues in Table 1. Interpretive Structural Modelling (ISM) along with type −1 Fuzzy
set theory is used to draw the contextual relationships. Two case examples are considered in
this paper to illustrate the Fuzzy Interpretive Structural Modelling (FISM) methodology.
The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In “Fuzzy interpretive structural modelling
(FISM)”section we discussed on Fuzzy Interpretive structural modelling (FISM). In “Illustration with an example” section we used FISM methodology to find the structural
relationship between the identified issues for extension of useful life of the product, which
is followed by discussion and conclusion in fourth and fifth section respectively.

Multi Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) is classified into two categories, Classical MCDM
method and Fuzzy MCDM method [27]. In classical MCDM methods individual preferences
are usually represented by numbers, expressing exact degree of preferences of decision
makers. On the other hand, in Fuzzy MCDM individual preferences are expressed by linguistic
