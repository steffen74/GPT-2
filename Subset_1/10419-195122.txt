Wind energy has become a significant resource for many electric utility systems. Wind
turbines are the fastest developing technology to harness that energy. The maintenance costs
associated with wind turbines are very high due to their structure, the remote locations where
they are installed, and the hard-to-access components [7]. However, the high maintenance cost
is not the only difficulty associated with sustaining wind turbines. The productivity loss that
results from the failure of wind turbines is also very high because of the loss of energy they
produce per unit time. Thus, it is imperative that wind turbines are maintained in a timely and
proactive manner. This study proposes embedding sensors into wind turbines. These sensors
can monitor the wind turbines while they are in operation and provide condition information
about their components. The data acquired from the sensors can subsequently be used to detect
the deterioration of the components and potentially predict failures before they occur. This can
decrease the maintenance cost because it negates the need for an inspection. In addition, the
required repair operations can be performed before the failure, resulting in less downtime and
less productivity loss cost.
Sensors also add value to wind turbine EOL processing. They provide vital condition
information about the components of wind turbines and, subsequently, facilitate EOL processing decisions related to whether to recycle, refurbish, and/or remanufacture the components
prior to disassembly. Similar to the maintenance aspect, when sensors are embedded into wind
turbines, the inspection operation is eliminated since the conditions of the components are
known by means of the embedded sensors. These benefits increase the profit that can be
generated from wind turbines that are at the end of their useful life cycles [50].
This study aimed to assess the economic benefits associated with embedding sensors into
wind turbines. To compare these benefits, regular wind turbine (RWT) and sensor-embedded
wind turbine (SEWT) systems were modeled using discrete event simulation. A design of
experiments study was used to compare the performance measures of these systems. Pairwise
t-tests were also performed to determine whether the SEWT systems offer significant value
over RWT systems.

Literature review
This paper employs sensor embedded products in closed-loop supply chain systems. This
section provides literature review about operations in closed-loop supply chains and sensor
embedded products. A systematic review of the studies relevant to environmental issues in
reverse supply chains that were published before 1998 was developed by Gungor and Gupta
[18]. This was later extended by Ilgin and Gupta with a further study that covered the period
1998–2010 [23] and classified the papers published during that period in the area of environmentally conscious manufacturing and product recovery (ECMPRO) into several categories
including product design, reverse and closed-loop supply chains, remanufacturing and disassembly. Gupta [19] presented an overview of reverse supply chains and issues involved in their
implementation. More recently, Ilgin et al. [31] presented a further state-of-the-art survey of

133

perspective framework for reverse logistics based on stakeholders’ theory. Hatcher et al. [22]
presented a literature review on design for remanufacture while Priyono et al. [54] provided a
systematic review on disassembly for remanufacturing. For additional information on
remanufacturing, see the book by Ilgin and Gupta [28].

Logistics of used products
The logistical operations associated with closed-loop supply chains span several processes
including collecting used products from the customers and collection centers, transporting
these products to the EOL facilities, and routing vehicles between collection centers, customer
locations, and EOL facilities. Several articles have been published that study the logistics of
used products and these are reviewed in this subsection.
Dethloff [9] proposed a solution to the vehicle routing problem in the form of a heuristic
procedure that consisted of simultaneous delivery and pickup processes. He later extended
this study by considering backhauling in the vehicle routing problem and applied the same
heuristics to solve this problem before presenting a comparison of the two vehicle routing
problems [10]. Alshamrani et al. [1] used a heuristic procedure with different sub-rules to
solve a similar vehicle routing problem involving deliveries and pickups. The authors
presented a case study in which they examined the processes operated by the American Red
Cross to deliver and pick up blood. Mourão and Almeida [42] proposed a method of
solving the vehicle routing problem within the context of the collection of household refuse
in Lisbon, Portugal. They modeled the problem as a capacitated arc routing problem and
proposed a model based on the route-first cluster-second method that consisted of a threephase heuristics procedure. They concluded that this method generated a near optimal
solution. Mourão and Amado [43] modeled the same problem as that studied in the work of
Mourão and Almeida [42] as a mixed capacitated arc routing problem and solved the
problem by using a new heuristics procedure.
Blanc et al. [2] analyzed different network design scenarios for recycling EOL vehicles at
Auto Recycling Netherland (ATN). Recycling vehicles incur high transportation costs; as such,
it is important to identify an optimal method of transporting the used vehicles. Thus, they
modeled the problem as vehicle routing problem. Blanc et al. [3] adapted a heuristics
procedure that used route generation and set partitioning to solve the vehicle routing problem
with multi-depot pickup and deliveries. They applied this method to solve the problem
described in the ATN case study. Krikke et al. [38] developed a new methodology to collect
dismantled materials from EOL vehicles. Within this methodology, the inventory was monitored, and dismantled materials were grouped as MUST and CAN orders. MUST materials
were collected when there was an order, while CAN materials could only be collected if the
capacity and routing of the vehicles allowed. This problem was solved by applying the set
partitioning and route generation method. Again, the proposed procedure was applied to solve
the problem described in the ATN case study. Schultmann et al. [58] presented a similar
vehicle routing problem within a case study in Germany.
Gribkovskaia et al. [17] used improvement heuristics and tabu search to solve the single
vehicle routing problem with pickups and deliveries by modeling the problem as a mixed
integer programming model. Kim et al. [36] presented a vehicle routing problem study that



Disassembly scheduling
During the disassembly operation, a product is separated into its components and subassemblies [21]. Due to the high costs associated with disassembly operations, it is crucial that an
optimal disassembly schedule is determined when disassembling products. The disassembly
operation is important for closed-loop supply chains; as such, disassembly scheduling literature becomes of interest to this study.
Kim et al. [34] presented a disassembly scheduling problem with multiple product structures and common parts. They aimed to fulfill the demand for components by disassembling
the root items from the products while minimizing the costs associated with disassembly; e.g.,
setup, inventory, and disassembly costs. The problem was solved by using heuristics with
linear programming relaxation. Kim et al. [35] enhanced Kim et al.’s previous study [34] by
introducing another phase to the existing solution method. After finding an initial solution
through the use of linear programming relaxation, a dynamic programming algorithm with a
look-ahead check was adopted to improve this solution. Kim et al. [37] developed a branch
and bound algorithm integrated with Lagrangian relaxation to solve the disassembly scheduling problem with single product types that have no parts commonality. They also included a
comparison between the results of the proposed algorithm and the previous heuristics study.
Kim and Xirouchakis [33] modified the problem by addressing stochastic demand and limited
resource capacity. A Lagrangian heuristic was used to solve the problem. Lee et al. [39]
introduced an integer programming model to obtain solutions for disassembly scheduling
problems for single or multi-product types with parts commonality.
Stuart and Christina [59] proposed the use of priority rules when scheduling product
disassembly. In their study, the disassembled components and materials were recycled to
generate revenue. The priority rules were applied to the products in disassembly queues so
that maximum revenue could be generated by optimally scheduling the disassembly of each
product. The researchers used a discrete event simulation to model the problem and evaluated
the results based on the product turnover. Rios and Stuart [55] enhanced the previous study by
including the plastic demand for recycling. Brander and Forsberg [4] studied the lot-scheduling
problem for a disassembly facility. Based on the heuristic method proposed in this study, the
disassembly frequencies of each individual item were calculated by optimizing the profit. This
information facilitated the effectiveness of the disassembly scheduling. Prakash et al. [53]
introduced a constraint-based simulated annealing algorithm to find a disassembly schedule by
optimizing the inventory levels. More recently, Tian and Zhang [60] examined a capacitated
disassembly scheduling and pricing problem, in which the disassembly yield of returned
products depends on their acquisition prices.

Maintenance
Operational maintenance procedures have a direct impact on the profitability of closed-loop
supply chain systems. Manufacturers have employed several maintenance strategies, including
corrective maintenance, preventive maintenance, proactive maintenance, and predictive maintenance, to sustain products for longer periods. This paper tests a predictive maintenance

monitored. The use of sensors in electric power transformers can help monitor vibrations.
According to Efthymiou et al. [15], maintenance can cover 60 to 75% of the total life cycle
cost of a manufacturing system. They proposed a platform that facilitated the use of sensors
with multiple sensing abilities rather than simple ones. This platform had three phases: data
acquisition and analysis, knowledge management, and maintenance dashboard. The researchers asserted that data acquisition and analysis in the form of ARIMA models would
help capture the failures and estimate the remaining useful lives of the equipment. Rodriguez
and Perez [56] introduced a patented sensor that was capable of extracting information from
the structural deformation that results from wind damage to the blades. They attributed the
common causes of this damage to incident wind direction, force or velocity, and vibration.

Intelligent products
RFID-attached and sensor-embedded products are named as intelligent products in the literature. Meyer et al. [41] published a review of intelligent products within which they highlighted the various ways in which these products have been identified in the literature. According to
McFarlane et al. [40], an intelligent product has the following properties:

&
&
&
&
&

Processes a unique identification
Is capable of communicating effectively with its environment
Can retain or store data about itself
Deploys a language to display its features, production requirements, etc.
Is capable of participating in or making decisions relevant to its own destiny.

Meyer et al. [41] reviewed the use of intelligent products in different areas such as manufacturing, supply chains, asset management, and product life-cycle management. They described
how intelligent products can help improve manufacturing operations in terms of production
planning and control and developing customized products. They are also useful in supply
chains for sending goods, re-routing deliveries, and ensuring security. In addition, intelligent
product systems can also deliver satisfactory maintenance to the customers and efficiently
manage the product life cycle, both of which are beneficial. Last, but not least, the researchers
concluded that the EOL management of intelligent products is economically viable.
Since sensors-embedded products are used in this paper, the relevant literature is reviewed
here. Cheng et al. [6] introduced a Generic Embedded Device (GED) that can be installed into
the manufactured products. GEDs can capture data, update this data with real-time information, and then transmit it to the system. The data can be used for two purposes: improving
maintenance performance and estimating the remaining life of the equipment. Chang and
Hung [5] used sensors to sense the temperature and humidity inside concrete structures and
stored this information within a RFID system. Technical details of the system and the
mechanism by which it measured the temperature and humidity were explained in the article.
This study provided an example of the use of sensors to collect information about the
environment in which products have been used. Like concrete structures, sensors can also
be placed into appliances. Schmidt and van Laerhoven [57] explained the kind of information
sensors could capture and how this information can be valuable to users. Sensors can provide



Vadde et al. [61] proposed the use of sensors to track products during their life cycles and
estimate the conditions of the product components. Ilgin and Gupta [24] enhanced the ideas
presented by Vadde et al. and used the information collected by sensors to improve the EOL
processing performance of the products. They analyzed the economic impact sensors had on
the disassembly and inspection operations of EOL products. A series of papers (Ilgin and
Gupta [25–27]; Ilgin et al. [29, 30]; Zhang et al. [62]) experimented with this by embedding
sensors in different product combinations and studied their economic impact on their respective systems.
Ondemir and Gupta [45, 46, 48] presented a study that employed sensor-embedded
products within a disassembly-to-order (DTO) and remanufacturing-to-order system. This
system incorporated a disassembly operation, which was triggered by remanufactured product,
component or material demand. The researchers applied different methods to solve this
problem, such as integer programming, fuzzy goal programming, and an Internet of Things
approach. Ondemir et al. [49] and Ondemir and Gupta [47] studied a DTO and repair-to-order
system. This system fulfills demand by repairing products and components instead of
remanufacturing. In another study, Ondemir and Gupta, [44] suggested fulfilling demand by
refurbishing products.
Dulman and Gupta [11, 12] enhanced the idea of using sensors within closed-loop supply
chains. These systems involved collecting EOL products, disassembling them, dividing the
components into several quality levels, and subsequently selling remanufactured products,
refurbished components, and recycled materials. Dulman and Gupta [13, 14] proposed the use
of sensors to upgrade the maintenance experience of the products. They found that sensors
provided condition information about the products and this information was used to estimate
failures and, thereby, allowing appropriate preventative action to be taken in advance of the
failure.

System description
In this section, the maintenance operations and EOL processing of wind turbines and the
details of the RWT and SEWT systems that were modeled in the study are explained. Once
wind turbines are sold and installed, they start producing energy. The manufacturers’ goal is to
ensure the turbines remain in operation and, thus, energy production is maintained so that the
buyers can also generate sustained levels of profit out of the wind turbines. One way in which
manufacturers achieve this is by performing regular maintenance.
When wind turbines no longer produce reasonable amount of energy, they are returned to
the manufacturers for EOL processing. At this stage, the products are remanufactured,
refurbished or recycled based on the conditions of the components. If the components are in
reusable condition, remanufacturing or refurbishing options are chosen. Otherwise, they are
recycled or disposed of based on the materials they contain. Figure 1 illustrates the overall life
cycle of the wind turbines and the EOL processing flow.

the RWT systems, the wind turbines were checked twice a year based on the preventive
maintenance strategy. However, unexpected failures might also happen. If the wind
turbines fail, the service team provided the required maintenance service, and any failed
components were replaced with new ones. Once they complete their life cycles, the
turbines are disassembled and sent to an EOL processing facility. Figure 2 shows the
wind turbine life cycle.

Maintenance of RWT systems
Figure 3 presents the flowchart of the maintenance activities involved in the RWT systems.
The standard RWT process modeled in this study was as follows. The repair personnel team
arrives on site at the location where the wind turbines are installed. They inspect the wind
turbines and determine the cause of failure. Based on the type of failure, the manufacturer is
notified, and the required service operations are determined. The failed components are
replaced with new ones so that the EOL conditions of these failed components are better.
Service operations are only provided when the wind turbines fail. Preventive maintenance is
also provided by inspecting the conditions of the wind turbines twice a year.
The failures incur a productivity loss because the wind turbines do not produce energy
during the failure and service period. Within this study, productivity loss was calculated as a
function of the annual energy production and the time between the time of failure and service
completion. The productivity loss was added to the overall maintenance cost. The maintenance
cost also included inspection and material replacement costs. Inspection costs were incurred
when determining failures and failed components. Material replacement cost was deemed to be



Fig. 3 Maintenance operations of RWT systems

Maintenance of SEWT systems
Figure 4 illustrates the flowchart of the maintenance activities for the SEWT. The sensors are
embedded into the wind turbines and subsequently track the performance and condition of the
components during their use. By interpreting the data collated by the sensors, the operators
predict failures before they occur, thereby negating the need for an additional inspection to
determine the cause of a failure. When the sensors detect a potential failure, a signal is
transmitted to the manufacturer. Repair personnel provide the required service on site.
In the SEWT systems, the period of failure and service was less than that of the RWT
systems. As such, they incurred less productivity loss, and this is a major benefit of using

139

provide the operators with vital information about which components have failed, thereby
negating the need for an inspection process.

Wind turbine EOL processes
After the wind turbines complete their life cycles, they are disassembled and transported to the
EOL facility. EOL processing commences with the disassembly process, which is completed
on the customer site following the operator’s inspection. The parts are then reused, recycled or
disposed of based on the materials they contain. The components that are to be sold as used
subassemblies or used to remanufacture wind turbines are inspected to determine their quality
level. The inspection process is not required for the SEWT systems because the required
condition information is provided by the sensors.

EOL processes of RWT systems
This section explains the details of the disassembly and inspection processes for the RWT
systems. In RWT systems, each subassembly is disassembled and transported to the EOL
facility. Within the study, the disassembly cost was determined to be the combination of
the time taken to disassemble the subassemblies and the labor costs incurred in doing so.
Since the subassemblies of wind turbines are heavy and of a large size, the cost of
transporting subassemblies is high. Thus, the transportation cost was also considered in
the calculations of the total cost of EOL wind turbine processing. Once the subassemblies
arrive at the EOL facility, they are inspected to determine the reusability of the subassemblies and the accompanying quality levels. As such, the inspection cost applied in this
study was the combination of the inspection time and the labor costs. If the subassemblies
are reusable, they are sent to proper reprocessing locations such as resale or
remanufacturing. Figure 5 shows the flowchart of the disassembly and inspection processes for the RWT systems.

EOL processes of SEWT systems
Embedding sensors into wind turbines changes the flow of EOL processing since they provide
condition information about the products and this data can be used to inform the plan for
disassembling subassemblies. Figure 6 illustrates the details of the disassembly and inspection
processes of the SEWT systems.
First, the reusability information of the subassemblies is retrieved from sensors and is used
to delay disassembly until a reusable subassembly in the following disassembly sequence is
identified. In the case of wind turbines, the tower is disassembled first and then the rotor blade,
nacelle, gearbox, and generator. If the rotor blade is not in a reusable condition, it is not
disassembled. However, if the nacelle is reusable, they are disassembled together. The purpose
of this approach is to reduce the disassembly costs by allowing the destructive disassembly of
any subassemblies that are not reusable and by combining the disassembly of the subassemblies. Furthermore, the data collated by the sensor can be used to perform an upfront inventory
check for each quality level. If the subassemblies are reusable, they are labeled with their



Fig. 5 RWT systems disassembly and inspection processes

quality level subassembly is sent to the relevant reprocessing location; for example, resale or
remanufacturing.

Reprocessing operations
Reprocessing starts once disassembly and inspection are complete. For disassembled subassemblies, three quality levels are used to categorize their quality:

&
&
&

High quality (HQ): Expected to last 12–15 years.
Medium quality (MQ): expected to last 9–12 years.
Low quality (LQ): expected to last 6–9 years.

Figure 7 illustrates the HQ-subassembly flow. If the HQ remanufactured wind turbine inventory level is not at its maximum level, the disassembled subassembly is sent to HQ
remanufacturing buffer area. Otherwise, the manufacturer checks the maximum HQsubassembly inventory for subassembly sales. If the subassembly meets the maximum HQsubassembly inventory level, the manufacturer sends the subassembly for use in MQ processes
instead of recycling it because these HQ subassemblies can increase the quality level of MQ
subassemblies and can generate more revenue if the manufacturer remanufactures them or sells
them as used subassemblies. This is also applicable at the MQ level. If the HQ subassemblies
are not used at the MQ level, they are sent to the LQ level instead of being recycled. If HQ
subassemblies are not used at any of the quality levels, they are either recycled or disposed of

141

Fig. 6 SEWT systems disassembly and inspection processes

Like HQ-level flow, MQ- and LQ-level flows are also considered in this study. The MQlevel flow considers MQ- and LQ-level subassemblies, while the LQ-level flow considers only
LQ-level subassemblies.
In the study, a closed-loop supply chain system for wind turbines was modeled, and its
performance was evaluated. The analysis took into consideration both the maintenance and the
EOL processing of the wind turbines. Since EOL processing follows the life cycle of the wind
turbines, maintenance is crucial. Replacing components as a means of maintaining the lifespan



Fig. 7 HQ-subassembly flow for recycle, resale and remanufacturing

If the subassemblies are used for remanufacturing, they are stored in the remanufacturing
buffer area respective to their quality level. Once a set is complete that contains one from each
component type, the components are assembled. The assembly process adds to the assembly
cost. The remanufactured wind turbines remain in the remanufactured wind turbine inventory.
When there is a demand for the parts, the manufacturer sells them. If demand is lacking, they
remain in the inventory, and the holding costs are increased.
Within the study, it was assumed that the demands in the systems followed a Poisson distribution
and the systems receive demands for each quality level of remanufactured wind turbine or subassemblies. If the inventory is sufficient to fulfill the demand, the manufacturer sells the remanufactured
wind turbines and generates revenue. Otherwise, the manufacturer places the units in a backordered
status, incurring backordering costs. Figure 8 illustrates the wind turbine remanufacturing process,
demand flows, and the effect of remanufacturing and demands on the revenue and cost.

Design of Experiments Study
The RWT and SEWT systems assessed in this study and the differences between them were
introduced in the previous section. This section provides details of the design of experiments
study that was conducted within this work. The goal of the design of experiments study was to
determine the economic contribution the sensors make to the closed-loop supply chains

143

Fig. 8 Remanufacturing flow of wind turbines

It was determined that 63 factors could have an impact on the performance measures that
were relevant to this study. By choosing two levels for 63 factors, a full factorial design would
require 9.223372E + 18 experiments. It was not reasonable to conduct this many experiments
within the scope of this study. As such, an orthogonal arrays method was chosen for the
factorial design. With this method, a subset of experiments was chosen. For 63 factors with 2
levels, the orthogonal arrays method suggested 64 experiments. Specifically, L64(263) orthogonal array [52] was used for the factorial design in the design of experiments study. The data
required to conduct the experiments was referenced from the study conducted by OrtegonMosquera [51].
Table 1 shows the price factors for remanufactured wind turbines and subassemblies. HQand MQ-level factors were included in the factorial design. LQ-level prices were excluded
because their impact on the performance measure was not considered to be significant.
The factorial design included the disassembly times and the costs of the subassemblies, as
shown in Table 2.
The factorial design also included the inspection times and costs of the subassemblies, as
shown in Table 3.
Tables 4, 5, and 6 show the probability distributions. The reusability chance and quality
level distributions can be seen in Table 4. As can be seen in Table 4, only HQ and MQ-level
components were used in the factorial design. LQ-level probabilities were excluded from the
factorial design. They are shown in Table 5 separately.

In the systems assessed in this study, it was assumed that exceeding the renewal-time
threshold would have a negative impact on the return condition of the subassemblies. The
quality level distribution of the subassemblies when the renewal-time threshold was exceeded
is shown in Table 6.
The additional factors that were relevant to the maintenance aspect of the modeled systems
are presented in Table 7. The recognition of failure and service activation processes were
included in the factors. It was assumed that they would have a significant impact on the
maintenance costs because they incur productivity losses, which reduce energy production.
Productivity loss resulting in lower energy production was considered to be a significant factor.
Moreover, the inspection time it takes to determine the failure was also of importance because
this increases the inspection cost of the RWT systems, while the inspection process is
eliminated in the SEWT systems by means of sensors. This inspection cost is, therefore, of
significance when determining the economic benefits of the sensors.
Demands for the remanufactured wind turbines and subassemblies were also included in the
factorial design. Table 8 shows these factors. The demands followed a Poisson distribution and
had annual Poisson rates. As mentioned previously, the LQ-level components were not
included in the factorial design because they were deemed to have an insignificant impact
on the performance measures.
The factorial design included the remanufacturing process, which included the factors
associated with assembly time, assembly cost, and scrap revenue. The scrap revenue was
calculated in dollars per ton, as Table 9 shows.
In the maintenance part of the systems, the subassemblies were replaced once they failed.
The material costs for the replacement of the subassemblies was included in the factorial
design as Table 10 shows.
Arena 14.7 [32] discrete event simulation software was used to model the RWT and SEWT
systems and run the experiments. A verification technique that consisted of running the
experiments with extreme values was also used so that the models were verified as to whether
they were going to provide the expected outcomes. The models were run for 9125 days, which
corresponded to 25 years. Since the expected life time of the wind turbines was 20 years and
this study considered EOL processing of the wind turbines, this run length was deemed to be

sufficient to produce reliable experiment results. Each model was run 64 times, equating to the
number of experiments conducted, for both RWT and SEWT systems. In addition to the data
related to the factors described above, additional data was used to run the experiments, which
is shown in Appendix (see Tables 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 19).
During the experimental phase, several performance measures were determined and collected as outputs of the simulation models. By using these measures, it was possible to
determine the economic contribution the sensors made to the closed-loop supply chain
systems. Both maintenance and EOL processes were taken into consideration in the systems.
With regard to maintenance processes, the maintenance cost of the wind turbines was collected
as a measure. For the EOL processes, the potential profit that could be earned from EOL
processing of the wind turbines was observed. The formulas that helps to calculate the
performance measures can be seen below.
Maintenance cost ¼ Labor Cost þ Productivity Loss Cost þ Material Replacement Cost
Total Profit ¼ Total Revenue–Total Cost
Total Revenue ¼ Sales Revenue þ Scrap Revenue
Total Cost ¼ Collection Cost þ Disassembly Cost þ Inspection Cost þ Remanufacturing
Cost þ Holding Cost þ Backordering Cost þ Disposal Cost þ Transportation Cost
Sensor Value ¼ ðMaintenance Cost Savings þ Total Profit ImprovementÞ=Total Number of Sensors

maintenance cost per wind turbine, disassembly cost, inspection cost, and total profit of the
systems. The EOL profits per wind turbine for the SEWT and RWT systems were $8121.04
and $8039.90 respectively. This was the profit that could be made by processing the wind
turbines after they completed their life cycles. The maintenance costs per wind turbine for the
SEWT and RWT systems were $61,577.40 and $110,850.00 respectively. These figures
denoted the amount of expenditure that was required to maintain the wind turbines during
their life cycles. The disassembly costs, inspection costs, and total profit of both systems are
also presented in Table 11.
The mean values of the systems presented in Table 11 shows that the SEWT systems
performed better than the RWT systems for each of the performance measures. It was
important to test this performance statistically to determine its significance level. As such, a
pairwise t-test was performed. This particular test was chosen because it allows the analysis of
the mean differences and compares the experiments as pairs for both systems. Comparing the
experiments as pairs was important because the orthogonal arrays method uses a specific
factorial design and experiments should be paired to produce unbiased results. Table 12 shows
the t-test results including mean differences and p-values for each performance measure.
The mean difference in EOL profit per wind turbine between the SEWT and RWT systems
assessed in this study was $81.13. The p-value was 0.2328, meaning that the difference
between the two systems was not statistically significant. In accordance with that, the total
profit difference between the systems was also not statistically significant. The mean difference
in maintenance cost per wind turbine was −49,272.64, meaning that the manufacturers could
save $49,272.64 through the use of the SEWT system. The p-value was less than 0.0001 and,
as such, the maintenance cost difference between the systems was extremely statistically

significant. The disassembly cost and inspection cost differences between the two systems
were also statistically significant. These statistics are presented in Table 12.
The EOL profit improvement and maintenance cost savings between the SEWT and
RWT systems were combined to calculate the sensor value. According to this calculation,
the mean value of the sensor was $49,353.77. This means that the use of sensors in a
closed-loop wind turbine supply chain could contribute as much as $49,353.77. Table 13
presents the additional results of the pairwise t-test including the confidence intervals of
the performance measures.

Conclusions
Information retrieval from products has become popular in recent years. Embedding sensors
into products and tracking them during their use phase is one very popular information retrieval
method. This study compared two closed-loop supply chain systems for wind turbines, SEWT
and RWT systems, to test the performance of the sensors and calculate the economic contribution they could make to closed-loop supply chain systems. The results of the experiments
conducted in this study showed that the sensors enhanced the maintenance performance of the
wind turbine systems by estimating the failures. The sensors delivered maintenance cost
savings as high as $49,272.64 in SEWT systems relative to RWT systems. In addition, the

use of sensors increased the total profit of the EOL processing of the wind turbines. As such, the
results of this study indicate that embedding sensors into wind turbines can represent a
commercially viable means of reducing the cost of maintaining wind turbines as well as
increasing the EOL profit that can be generated when they complete their useful lives.
This study has illustrated that sensors provide economic benefits to wind turbines systems.
In addition, they are also helpful in supply chain management of such systems. Supply and
demand planning can be improved by means of sensors because the products are tracked
throughout their life cycles. Sensors are also helpful to designers who can use the information
derived from them to increase the reliability of the components as sensors can track changes in
their conditions and possible reasons behind such changes.
This research assumed that sensors will be able to provide reliable information during the
use-phase of wind turbines. However, if sensors are unreliable, they could lead to inaccurate
data. Since wind turbines can be expensive, inaccurate data on the conditions of their
components could result in replacing components more frequently than necessary or conversely not replacing components when necessary. Any of these situations is undesirable and may
reduce or eliminate all the benefits that are expected from sensors. Thus, one idea of future
work is to conduct a study to assess the reliability of the sensors and recommend methods to
mitigate such situations.
