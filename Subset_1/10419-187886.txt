1. Introduction
The enormous greenhouse gases (GHG) emission, especially
carbon dioxide (CO2 ), produced by human activities and their influence on climate conditions became a major ecological and political challenge. Concentration of GHG in atmosphere increased
quickly over the past decades. For example, CO2 concentration had
risen to 380 ppm in 2006 compared to 280 ppm in 1700 (IPCC,
2007). If the increasing trend of GHG emission continues, there
is the possibility of huge climate changes in the future (Timmermann et al., 1999). Although, details of predictions are a subject
for argue, due to uncertainty in climate projections, most scientific societies agree that increasing of temperature has considerable negative impacts on human developments and natural and
agricultural ecosystems (Fischlin and Midgeley, 2007). Nevertheless, it is believed that these occurrences can be avoided with significant decreases in GHG emission (Meinshausen et al., 2009). It is
therefore important to realize GHG emissions from various actions and resources in production systems to recognize potential areas
for emissions reductions.
Climate change and air pollution are major environmental concerns related to use of fossil fuel energy. Furthermore, considering
that fossil fuel energy is a limited resource, it has to be conserved
for future generations by efficient use in energy. Agricultural production systems and energy consumption have very closed relation. Agriculture is an energy user and energy supplier (Alam
et al., 2005). Energy use in agricultural production systems has elevated in response to increasing human population, limited supply
of arable land and desire in improving standards of living (Banaeian
et al., 2011). Agriculture practices are a considerable contributor to
rising GHG level (Jones et al., 2012). The role of these practices is
about 20% of total anthropogenic GHG emission (IPCC, 2001). However, a pretty low percentage of agricultural emissions (13%) are
as CO2 while it contributed to about 60% of global anthropogenic
nitrous oxide (N2 O) emissions and 50% of global anthropogenic
methane (CH4 ) emissions (Smith et al., 2007). Production, formulation, storage, distribution of agricultural inputs and application
with tractorized equipment lead to consumption different source
of energy such as diesel fuel, which emits GHG into atmosphere.
Therefore, a reasonable first step for GHG emission reductions in agroecosystems is quantify amount of emissions from specific
sources in production processes and identify the most economically sensible options for reduction of GHG emission (Jones et al.,
2012). To achieve these purposes, creation of available information related to energy use in operations farm, and their exchange
to GHG equivalents and finally expressing energy use in terms of
GHG emission as kg carbon equivalent is very essential (Lal, 2004).
In Iran, the energy consumption in agricultural sector has been
recently questioned due to raise energy demand, costs and more
mechanized in various agricultural operations (Mohammadi et al.,
2014). Although, many studies have been conducted on the energy
consumption in different crops including wheat (Ghorbani et al.,
2011), sugar beet (Asgharipour et al., 2012), cotton and grain
corn (Zahedi et al., 2014, 2015), tomato (Rezvani-Moghaddam
et al., 2011), been, lintel, and chickpea (Koocheki et al., 2011) but,
few numbers of them have focused on GHG emission (e.g. sugar
beet Yousefi et al., 2014 and wheat Khoshnevisan et al., 2013b).
Whereas, the agricultural sector of Iran was done in various
climatic regions and soil environments, hence, it is very essential to
quantify energy consumption and GHG emission for each climatic
region.
One of the most crop in Iran is wheat which produced approximately 12.4 million tons from a total area of 6.4 million ha (about
3.9 million ha of dryland wheat agroecosystem and 2.5 million
ha of irrigated wheat agroecosystem) in 2013 (MAJ, 2013). The
wheat production system is a major income source and an important source of employment for many rural families. Therefore, the
objectives of present study were (i) to assess the total energy consumed and the share of each energy sources, (ii) to evaluate energy
use efficiency and energy productivity, and finally (iii) to quantify
GHG emission according to energy inputs for irrigated and dryland
wheat agroecosystems in different climatic regions.
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Study location
The present study was conducted in Kermanshah province,
in the west of Iran, is located between the latitudes 33°42′ N
and 35°17′ N and the longitudes 45°25′ E and 48°60′ E. The average annual temperature and precipitation were 16.5 °C and

403 mm, respectively. In 2013, the wheat cultivating area in Kermanshah province was almost 547 000 ha, including about 340 000
and 207 000 ha dryland and irrigated farms, respectively. In this
province, wheat production occurs with a range of different growing conditions. Therefore, based on information collected from
central meteorological station, different locations of Kermanshah
province were classified in five climatic regions based on De Martonne method (Fig. 1).
The details of the cultivated area for irrigated and dryland
wheat agroecosystems in each climatic region were collected
from Ministry of Jihad-E-Agriculture of Iran (MAJ, 2013). After
data collection, all agricultural activities such as land preparation,
seeding rate, irrigation water, chemical fertilizers, pesticides and
human labour needed in irrigated and dryland wheat farms were
separately determined.
2.2. Energy input and output
To quantify the relationship between irrigated and dryland
wheat yields and there energy consumptions and GHG emission,
data were collected from growers in each climatic region using
a face-to-face questionnaire during 2013. The sample size was
calculated according to Neyman method (Eq. (1)) (Yamane, 1967):
n=

N × S2
2
(N − 1)SX + S 2

(1)

where n is the required sample size, N is the population volume,
2
S is the standard deviation, SX Sh is the standard deviation of the
sample mean (SX = d/z), d is the permissible error in the sample
size, was defined to be 10% of the mean for a 95% confidence
interval, and z is the reliability coefficient (1.96, which represents
a 95% reliability). Based on above calculations, the sample size was
386 (186 and 200 for irrigated and dryland wheat agroecosystems,
respectively).
The data obtained from the questionnaires averaged and generalized to 1 ha. In order to estimate the energy inputs consumed
in wheat farms, human labour, machinery, diesel fuel, seeds,
farmyard manure (FYM), chemical fertilizers (nitrogen, phosphate,
potassium and micro fertilizers), pesticides and herbicides (kg or
liter) amounts were multiplied by their energy equivalents (Table 1).

The energy outputs in wheat agroecosystems were grain and
straw yields. The grain yield usually was collected by harvesting
machines. The straw yield commonly was collected by packing machines and residues were returned to soil. In order to estimate the
energy outputs, the grain and straw yields were multiplied by energy equivalent (Table 1). In this study amount of input and output
energies were reported in terms of (MJ) that its value is equal to 106
joules. Then energy indicators such as energy use efficiency, energy
productivity, specific energy and net energy were computed by the
following equations (Ghorbani et al., 2011; Demircan et al., 2006):
Energy-use efficiency =

Energy productivity =

Specific Energy =

Energy output (MJ ha−1 )
Energy input (MJ ha−1 )

crops output (Kg ha−1 )
Energy input (MJ ha−1 )

Energy input (MJ ha−1 )
crops output (t ha−1 )

using a common unit (Jones et al., 2012). The CO2 emission
coefficients were used to estimate amounts of GHG emission from
inputs in irrigated and dryland wheat agroecosystems for each
climatic region (Table 3). The application of machinery (MJ), diesel
fuel (Liter), FYM (kg), chemical fertilizers (kg), biocides (kg) and
electricity (kWh) amounts were multiplied by their corresponding
emission coefficients. In addition, GHG emission per unit area (kg
CO2 equivalent per hectare), per unit weight (kg CO2 equivalent
per ton of wheat), per unit input and output energies (kg CO2
equivalent per MJ) were separately calculated.

Classification of consumed energy in agroecosystems can be
performed into two ways; 1: direct and indirect energies, and 2:
renewable and non-renewable energies. Each component of these
energy forms is given in Table 2 (Mohammadi et al., 2014). Surely,
the share of renewable energy in farming systems increases, the
system will enjoy the greater sustainability, on the other, raising
the share of energy supply from the internal system and declining
the relying on external energy will be high in the efficiency of
system (Kizilaslan, 2009).
2.3. Greenhouse gases emission
Emissions were expressed as CO2 equivalents (CO2-eq ), which
considers the global warming potential of various emission forms

The results indicated that average of total energy consumed
in various production processes in irrigated and dryland wheat
agroecosystems, regardless of climatic regions, were 53 082.9 and
15 603.3 MJ ha−1 , respectively. Among all the production practices
in irrigated wheat, diesel fuels consumed was the most energy
consuming input (51.2%), followed by chemical fertilizers (14.9%),
electricity (10%), seed (9%), and water for irrigation (7.3%) (Table 4
and Fig. 2). In dryland wheat agroecosystem, diesel fuel (48.9%)
consumed the most energy of total energy input, followed by
seed (23.8%), chemical fertilizer (17.6%) and machinery (7.1%)
(Table 5 and Fig. 2). It seems that higher energy consumption in
irrigated wheat agroecosystem than dryland wheat agroecosystem
was due to more use of diesel fuels and electricity for water
pumping process and more machinery utilization for land
preparation. Moreover, more seeds and nutrients consumption
due to higher plant density were other reasons. The results
also showed that irrigated wheat agroecosystem require more
human labour than dryland wheat agroecosystem (Tables 4 and
5). This is probably because of more operations during irrigated
wheat agroecosystem compare to dryland wheat agroecosystem.
Ghorbani et al. (2011) reported that total energy input for irrigated
Fig. 2. The share of important energy inputs from total energy input for irrigated and dryland wheat agroecosystems.

and dryland production systems in Northern Khorasan province of
Iran were 45 367 and 9354 MJ ha−1 , respectively. They indicated
that in irrigated wheat farms diesel fuel, chemical fertilizers and
electricity inputs were 10 950.2, 16 843.1 and 4320.0 MJ ha−1 ,
respectively. Similar results were reported on another studies such
as sugar beet (Asgharipour et al., 2012) and irrigated and dryland
chickpea production systems (Koocheki et al., 2011).

The results also revealed that the highest and the lowest energy input in irrigated wheat agroecosystem were 60 549.9 and
48 449.9 MJ ha−1 for arid–warm and wet–moderate climatic regions, respectively (Table 4). From Table 4 it is evident that
the most energy-consuming input in the arid–warm climatic region compare to other climatic regions was water for irrigation (33 316.1 MJ ha−1 ) and diesel fuel (4632.1 MJ ha−1 ). High

temperature and low precipitation in the arid–warm region cased
to farmers use greater water for irrigation operation, followed by
higher diesel fuel consumption for water pumping process.
In dryland agroecosystem, the highest and the lowest energy
input were 16 280.0 and 15 214.2 MJ ha−1 for wet–cold and semiarid–cold climatic regions, respectively (Table 5). There is a direct
relation between precipitation and chemical fertilizer utilization in
the dryland agroecosystem. It could be the main reason for higher
chemical fertilizers consumption and finally diesel fuel usage for
fertilizers distribution by machine in the wet–cold climatic region
compare to other climatic regions (Table 5).
3.2. Energy output in irrigated and dryland wheat agroecosystems
Regardless of climatic regions, average of grain and straw yields
were 4957.1 and 6707.4 kg ha−1 in irrigated wheat agroecosystem while in dryland wheat agroecosystem were 1538.2 and
3001.3 kg ha−1 , respectively. The average of total energy output
in irrigated and dryland wheat agroecosystems were calculated
as 156 707.0 and 60 127.7 MJ ha−1 , respectively (Tables 4 and 5).
Because of more energy consumption in irrigated wheat agroecosystem, total energy output was about 61.6% higher than dryland
wheat agroecosystem. In all climatic regions, the share of straw energy output was more than the share of grain energy output.
The results also revealed that the highest and the lowest energy
output in irrigated wheat agroecosystem were 174 289.2 MJ ha−1
(48.7% of grain energy and 51.3% of straw energy) and
114 940.0 MJ ha−1 (40.9% of grain energy and 59.1% of straw energy) in semiarid–cold and arid–warm climatic regions, respectively (Table 4). In dryland wheat agroecosystem the highest and
the lowest energy output were 70 805.9 MJ ha−1 (36.7% of grain
energy and 63.2% of energy straw) and 36 954.9 MJ ha−1 (37.2% of
grain energy and 62.8% of straw energy) for semiarid–warm and
arid–warm climatic regions, respectively (Table 5).
3.3. Energy indices in irrigated and dryland wheat agroecosystems
Regardless of climatic regions, average of energy use efficiency
of 3.00 and 3.85 observed in this research showed that 3.00
and 3.85 times energy were produced per each unit of energy

used in irrigated and dryland wheat agroecosystems, respectively
(Table 6). In energy balances, the energy ratio is frequently used
as an index to evaluate energy efficiency in crop production
systems (Kuesters and Lammel, 1999). The average of energy use
efficiency in dryland wheat agroecosystem was nearly 22.1% more
than irrigated wheat agroecosystem that showed dryland wheat
agroecosystem had produced higher output. On the other hands,
lower energy use efficiency in irrigated wheat agroecosystem may
be due to higher energy consumption. In other researches, energy
ratio was studied on different crops (e.g. 3.4 for dryland wheat
production system and 1.4 for irrigated wheat production system
Ghorbani et al., 2011), 1.2 for irrigated chickpea production system
and 2.9 for dryland chickpea production system (Koocheki et al.,
2011) and 13.4 for sugar beet (Asgharipour et al., 2012). The
results also indicted that in irrigated wheat agroecosystem, the
highest and the lowest energy use efficiency were 3.48 and 1.89 for
wet–cold and arid–warm climatic regions, respectively (Table 6).
In wet–cold climatic region compare to arid–warm climatic
region, total energy output was higher, and total energy input
was lower. Therefore, it could conclude that choose appropriate
environments for wheat production is very useful in sustainable
energy consumption.
The results of this study showed that average energy productivity in irrigated and dryland wheat agroecosystems were 0.098 and
0.092, respectively (Table 6). This means that 0.098 and 0.092 outputs were obtained per unit energy in irrigated and dryland wheat
agroecosystems, respectively (Table 6). Energy productivity in irrigated wheat agroecosystem under different climatic regions was
diverse. So that, the highest and the lowest energy productivity
were observed 0.11 and 0.05 in wet–cold and in arid–warm climatic regions, respectively. In dryland wheat agroecosystem the
highest energy productivity (0.12) belonged to semiarid–cold climate region and the lowest (0.06) belonged to arid–warm climate region (Table 6). Energy productivity is a very important indicator to evaluate crop production systems in terms of energy
consumption and energy output. High energy productivity indicates more sustainable and lower energy consumption and consequently higher security in agricultural production systems. Several
authors also obtained energy productivity for agricultural crops
production (e.g. Rezvani-Moghaddam et al., 2011; Koocheki et al.,
2011; Ghorbani et al., 2011).

Fig. 3. The share of direct and indirect energy inputs and renewable and non-renewable energy inputs from total energy input in irrigated and dryland wheat agroecosystems.

Total energy input as direct, indirect, renewable, and nonrenewable forms is also revealed in Table 6. In all climatic regions, the share of direct energy in irrigated wheat agroecosystem was higher than dryland wheat agroecosystem (Table 6 and
Fig. 3). The share of direct energy in irrigated wheat agroecosystem was about 68.7% (36 478.9 MJ ha−1 ) while it was about 48.5%
(7470.5 MJ ha−1 ) in dryland wheat agroecosystem (Fig. 3). These
findings may be due to do not use some energy resources such as
FYM, water of irrigation and electricity in dryland wheat agroecosystem. Therefore, it seems that dryland wheat agroecosystem
compare to irrigated wheat farms were more sustainable agricultural production systems.
Our finding also indicated that the share of renewable energy was higher in dryland wheat agroecosystem than irrigated
wheat agroecosystem (Table 6). Average of renewable and nonrenewable energies in irrigated wheat agroecosystem were 9343.5
and 43 746.5 MJ ha−1 , respectively, while they were 3745.0 and
11 859.5 MJ ha−1 in dryland wheat agroecosystem, respectively.
The share of renewable energy in dryland and irrigated wheat
agroecosystems were 24.0% and 17.6% of total energy input (Fig. 3).
The excessive consumption of diesel fuel and electricity were the
main reason for higher level of non-renewable and direct energies than renewable and indirect energies in irrigated wheat agroecosystem. Mohammadi et al. (2014) reported that total input energy in wheat farms of Golestan province was 26.2 GJ ha−1 , of
which the share of direct and indirect energies were 58.8% and
41.2%, respectively, and the share of non-renewable and renewable energies were 82.1% and 17.9%, respectively.

3.4. Greenhouse gases emission in irrigated and dryland wheat
agroecosystems
The results of GHG emission of surveyed irrigated and dryland
wheat agroecosystems in all climatic regions are presented in
Tables 7 and 8. The average of CO2 emission for irrigated wheat
agroecosystem was 3184.4 kg CO2-eq ha−1 and 680.4 kg CO2-eq t−1
whereas it was 553.1 kg CO2-eq ha−1 and 381.3 kg CO2-eq t−1
for dryland wheat agroecosystem. It seems that higher energy
consumption in irrigated wheat farms compare to dryland wheat
agroecosystem was the main reason of more CO2 emission. Among
all energy resources in irrigated wheat agroecosystem, diesel
fuels had the highest emission (46.9%), followed by electricity
(36.2%), FYM (7.5%), machinery (4.6%), chemical fertilizers (4.0%)
and biocides (0.8%) (Fig. 4). In dryland wheat agroecosystem, the
highest share of GHG emission belonged to diesel fuels (75.8%),
followed by machinery (14.2%), chemical fertilizers (8.5%) and
biocides (1.5%) (Fig. 5).
It can conclude that diesel fuel was the most important factor in increasing GHG emission in irrigated wheat agroecosystem. Among various operations in irrigated wheat agroecosystem, tillage operations are the largest contribute to using of diesel
fuel. Therefore, suitable methods such as removal or reduction of
summer fallow (a method of weed management), modify conventional tillage system to minimum or no-tillage systems, tillage operations when soil moisture content is in an appropriate state,
and finally chisel plow instead of conventional plow should be
taken to decrease diesel fuel consumption in wheat agroecosystems (Dayer and Desjandins, 2003). The important of fossil energy

use has been reported as the main contributors to GHG emission
by other researchers. Mohammadi et al. (2014) reported that diesel
fuel and nitrogen fertilizer consumption were the largest contributor to GHG emission, followed by electricity, chemical fertilizers
and pesticides in the Golestan province. They showed that the total GHG produced was calculated 1171.1 kg CO2-eq ha−1 . Khoshnevisan et al. (2013a) concluded that electricity was the largest
share (74%) in GHG emission, followed by nitrogen (11.7%), diesel
fuels (7.5%), machinery (4.5%), phosphate (1.1%), potassium (0.9%)
and pesticides (0.3%). Pathak and Wassmann (2007) reported that
GHG emission produced by wheat agroecosystem in India was between 1038 and 1624 kg CO2-eq ha−1 . Yousefi et al. (2014) revealed
that electricity with 73% had the highest GHG share of emissions in
sugar beet production system, followed by nitrogen fertilizer (15%)
and diesel fuels (7%). Zafiriou et al. (2012) also demonstrated that
among agricultural production systems, low input systems such

as organic farming reduced energy inputs and GHG emission in
Greece.
The results also revealed that the most GHG emission
in irrigated wheat agroecosystem were 3561.8, 3458.0 and
3076.2 kg CO2-eq ha−1 which were observed for arid–warm,
semiarid–cold and semiarid–warm climatic regions, respectively
(Tables 7 and 8 and Fig. 4). The lowest GHG emission in irrigated wheat agroecosystem was 2832.6 kg CO2-eq ha−1 for
wet–moderate climatic region that was consumed the lowest
energy inputs (48 450 MJ ha−1 ). In dryland wheat agroecosystem, the highest GHG emission was 584.2 kg CO2-eq ha−1 for
wet–cold climatic region which was consumed the most energy
inputs (16 280.0 MJ ha−1 ) and the lowest GHG emission was
523.1 kg CO2-eq ha−1 for semiarid–cold climatic region that was
consumed the lowest energy inputs (15 214.2 MJ ha−1 ) (Tables 7
and 8 and Fig. 5). Khakbazan et al., 2009 reported that GHG

emission in wheat production system was 410–1130 kg CO2-eq ha−1
in Canada. Soltani et al. (2013) also reported that GHG emission in
wheat farms was 1137 kg CO2-eq ha−1 and 291.3 kg CO2-eq t−1 in
north of Iran. These results were different with our results. It seems
that appropriate environmental conditions especially more precipitation and lower temperature in north of Iran and Canada compare
to Kermanshah province was the main reason of higher GHG emission in wheat agroecosystems.
4. Conclusion
This study attempted to analyze relationship between greenhouse gases emission and energy consumption of inputs in irrigation and dryland wheat agroecosystems in different climatic
regions of Kermanshah province, northwest Iran. Data were collected from 386 farms (186 and 200 for irrigated and dryland
wheat agroecosystems, respectively) selected using the random
sampling method. Our results showed that, regardless of climatic
regions, irrigated and dryland wheat agroecosystems consume a
total energy of 53 082.9 and 15 603.3 MJ ha−1 , respectively, which
were mainly because of diesel fuel (51.2% and 48.9% of total energy inputs in irrigated and dryland wheat agroecosystems, respectively). The highest and the lowest energy input in irrigated wheat
agroecosystem were 60 549.9 and 48 449.9 MJ ha−1 for arid–warm
and wet–moderate climatic regions, respectively, while in dryland wheat agroecosystem, the highest and the lowest energy input were 16 280.0 and 15 214.2 MJ ha−1 for wet–cold and semiarid–cold climatic regions, respectively. In all climatic regions,
the share of direct energy and non-renewable energy in irrigated
wheat agroecosystem was higher than dryland wheat agroecosystem, which were due to did not use FYM, water of irrigation and
electricity in dryland wheat agroecosystem. Therefore, it could
conclude that dryland wheat agroecosystem was more sustainable
agricultural production systems. It seems that decrease in the use
of fertilizers (particularly nitrogen), chemicals, and diesel fuel are
essential for improved energy management. Saving diesel fuel by
improving tillage operations might be possible (Asgharipour et al.,
2012).
The average of CO2 emission for irrigated wheat agroecosystem
was 3184.4 kg CO2-eq ha−1 and 680.4 kg CO2-eq t−1 while it
was 553.1 kg CO2-eq ha−1 and 381.3 kg CO2-eq t−1 for dryland
wheat agroecosystem. The major reason of more CO2 emission in

irrigated wheat agroecosystem was higher energy use. Among all
energy resources in irrigated wheat agroecosystem, diesel fuels
had the highest emission (46.9%), followed by electricity, FYM,
machinery, chemical fertilizers. In dryland wheat agroecosystem,
the highest share of GHG emission belonged to diesel fuels
(75.8%), followed by machinery, chemical fertilizers. The highest
GHG emission in the irrigated wheat agroecosystem were 3561.8,
3458.0 and 3076.2 kg CO2-eq ha−1 for arid–warm, semiarid–cold
and semiarid–warm climatic regions, respectively, while the
lowest GHG emission in irrigated wheat agroecosystem was
2832.6 kg CO2-eq ha−1 for wet–moderate climatic region. In the
dryland wheat agroecosystem, the highest GHG emission was
584.2 kg CO2-eq ha−1 for wet–cold climatic region and the lowest
GHG emission was 523.1 kg CO2-eq ha−1 for semiarid–cold climatic
region.
According to these findings, dryland wheat agroecosystem
compare to irrigated wheat agroecosystem was consumed lower
energy inputs and thereby emitted very lower GHG. Moreover,
wheat cultivation in suitable climatic regions leaded to reduce
energy consumption and GHG emission thereby decrease global
warming potential and atmospheric pollutions. Thus, it can conclude wheat production in dryland agroecosystem compare to irrigated agroecosystem is a cleaner agricultural production system in
terms of energy consumption and GHG emission. Despite of higher
grain and straw yields in irrigated wheat agroecosystem than dryland wheat agroecosystem, but GHG emission also was greater.
Nonetheless, it can recommend suitable strategies such as solar
energy for water pumping, biopesticides for pest management,
biofertilizers for soil fertility, which are very effective in reduce energy consumption. Subsequently, these strategies can reduce GHG
emission in irrigated wheat farms especially in climatic regions
that are located in warm and arid environments. Moreover, in order to reduce GHG emission in irrigated wheat agroecosystems, it is
suggested that utilize the sustainable agricultural approaches such
as decrease water for irrigation through modify planting date in
agreement with rainfall occurrence, improvement of soil fertility
by select suitable crop rotations, decrease of diesel fuels consumption and machinery usage via utilize conservation tillage systems.
