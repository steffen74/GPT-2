Absolute purchasing power parity (PPP) between two countries holds if the cost of a
market basket of tradable goods and services is the same in both countries in terms
of a common currency. If there are no barriers to trade or transactions costs, any
differences in the cost of the market basket are eliminated through arbitrage.
Interestingly, Cassel (1918) advanced the PPP hypothesis as the norm under the
in Sweden and its trading partners as arising from trade barriers.
Empirical testing of PPP presents some difﬁculties, but surmountable ones. First,
there are no data on the costs of a market basket of tradable goods and services.
Instead researchers use price indexes, but indexes contain data on non-traded goods
and services that are irrelevant in testing for PPP. Second, price indexes and
nominal exchange rates are constructed by the averaging of observations drawn at
different times and/or different locations. Such averaging can introduce bias into
unit root tests for PPP (Taylor 2001). Third, evidence of mean reversion of the real
exchange rate is regarded as evidence of purchasing power parity, but there is no
guarantee that the mean to which a real exchange rate measure constructed using
price indexes reverts is the PPP level. Of course there is no theoretical basis for
mean reversion to a real rate different from the one associated with PPP either.
Purchasing power parity in the real exchange rate between Mexico and the
United States is examined in this study. Focus on this bilateral relation is justiﬁed
because most of Mexico’s international trade has historically been with the US. This
paper extends previous work on PPP for the Mexico–US relationship in two
important ways. First, it makes use of the long-span, high-frequency data set
`
developed by Ventosa-Santaularia et al. (2015), henceforth VGW, and updated to
2014. Wallace et al. (2011) used the 1930–1960 portion of this data set to test for
´
PPP and Gomez-Zaldivar et al. (2013) studied PPP in Mexico with the data for
1969–2010, but this paper is the ﬁrst after VGW to utilize the complete data set.
Second, the study employs a recent approach to cointegration testing developed by
Enders et al. (2008) to examine the PPP hypothesis. The Enders, Im, and Lee
(henceforth EIL) methodology uses stationary instrumental variables for the
integrated series of the empirical model to overcome the difﬁculties of inference
posed by non-standard distributions of nonstationary variables. EIL show that the t
statistics of the estimated model are asymptotically normal when nonstationary
regressors are instrumented with stationary ones.
Taylor (2001) shows that bias against the PPP hypothesis can arise in tests of
stationarity of the real exchange rate due to temporal aggregation of high-frequency
data in the construction of the lower frequency price indexes. He demonstrates that
the bias reduces the power of unit root tests, but ﬁnds that bias diminishes with
longer data spans. In light of Taylor’s work most studies of purchasing power parity
have focused on industrial countries likely due to the availability of data over
extended spans. The long-span data set used in this study, thus, mitigates the bias
arising from temporal aggregation allowing tests of PPP for Mexico, a nation whose
economic development has lagged that of the industrial countries.
The long-span high-frequency data set put together by VGW and updated for this
study is a composite from several different sources. Monthly, historical nominal
exchange rate and price index data for Mexico, 1930–1960, are obtained from
´
Cardenas (1994) who cites the Bank of Mexico as a source, although the central
bank does not provide these historical ﬁgures through its statistical website. Post1960 data are from annual reports of the Bank of Mexico, commonly referred to as
Due to the large number of PPP studies, this review focuses only on PPP research
´
for Mexico. In studying real exchange rate variability and GDP in Mexico Avalos
´
Huerta and Hernandez Trillo (1995) fail to ﬁnd evidence of PPP in annual or
quarterly data for the Mexico–US real exchange rate for 1961–1994. McLeod and
Welch (1992) apply unit root and cointegration tests to quarterly data for the
Mexico–US real exchange rate, 1960–1991. They ﬁnd evidence of stationarity of
the real rate and cointegration of the nominal exchange rate and price levels, results
normally regarded as evidence of PPP between two countries. Despite their ﬁnding
McLeod and Welch express skepticism regarding the presence of PPP. Santaella and
Vela (2005) provide an excellent description and analysis of nominal exchange rate
´
policy in Mexico during the tumultuous period of 1987–1994. Mejıa Reyes and
´
´˜
Gonzalez Nunez (1996) test for absolute purchasing power parity in three measures
of the Mexico–US real exchange rate. Two of the real exchange rate measures are
constructed using annual data from 1940 to 1994 and the third for 1921–1994. The
three measures differ in the price indexes used to calculate the real exchange rate.
´
Using augmented Dickey–Fuller and Phillips–Perron unit root tests Mejıa Reyes and
´
´˜
Gonzalez Nunez ﬁnd weak evidence of stationarity of the real rate, thus support for
the PPP hypothesis, in the three series. They also apply the Engle–Granger tests to
the three series and conclude that the Mexican and US price levels are cointegrated
for both of the time periods studied although the evidence is weaker for 1921–1994.
Evidence from Johansen’s cointegration test provides weak evidence of PPP only
for the 1921–1994 period.
Hegwood and Papell (1998) argue that PPP requires reversion of the real
exchange rate to a constant mean. Unit root tests showing stationarity of the real
exchange rate in the presence of breaks are not evidence of PPP if shifts in the series
imply reversion to a changing mean. They deﬁne such instances of reversion to an
occasionally changing mean as quasi-purchasing power parity or QPPP. Noriega
and Medina (2003) test for PPP in annual data for the peso–dollar real exchange rate
for 1925–1994 allowing for an unknown number of structural breaks in the data.
Noriega and Medina ﬁnd that a structural break in the mean real exchange rate
occurred in 1981; but the rate is stationary both before and after this date, evidence
of QPPP.
Taylor (2002) tests for purchasing power parity in a data set composed of more
than 100 annual observations for 20 countries, including Mexico. His tests indicate
mean reversion, evidence of PPP, in Mexico and most of the other countries studied.
Several other studies have applied different stationarity tests to the Taylor data and
ﬁnd support for PPP in most countries including Mexico (Wallace and Shelley
2006; Bahmani-Oskooee et al. 2007; Wallace 2008, 2013).
´
Gomez-Zaldivar et al. (2013) use a unit root test developed by Kapetanios (2005)
allowing multiple, exogenously determined breaks to test for PPP in monthly data
for the Mexico–US real exchange rate, 1969–2010. They test an empirical model
allowing for a break in the mean, without trend, and another with breaks in the mean
alternatives reject the unit root null in favor of a stationary series with breaks. Most
of the breaks occurred between 1982 and 1987, a period associated with shifts
toward opening Mexico to additional foreign investment and expanding international trade.
As ﬁgure 1 in Ventosa et al. shows, the Mexico–US real exchange has been
volatile over the period 1930–2012, but the volatility is most pronounced in the
decade beginning 1980 during which exchange rate controls were adopted and
banks nationalized (Wallace 1999 provides a summary of events). VGW apply the
Kim, Leybourne, and Newbold unit root test which is robust to volatility changes
and ﬁnd evidence of purchasing power parity for the Mexico–US real exchange rate.
The test also reveals a structural break in the error variance occurring in July 1976,
shortly before Mexico switched from a ﬁxed nominal exchange rate regime to a
managed ﬂoat.

3 Methodology
If purchasing power parity holds between Mexico and the United States then Eq. (1)
follows:
cM À et ¼ ct ;
t

ð1Þ

where cM is the log of the cost of a market basket of tradable goods and services
t
denominated in Mexican pesos, ct is the log of the US dollar cost of the same market
basket in the United States, and et is the log of the nominal exchange rate in pesos
per US dollar.
As noted earlier, tests of PPP use price indexes rather than actual costs of a
market basket. Price indexes do not correspond to the cost terms in Eq. (1).
Consequently, an empirical test of PPP must modify the relationship yielding
À Á
Eq. (2), where the logged period t price indexes for Mexico pM and the United
t
States ðpt Þ replace the costs of the market basket in Eq. (1) and an error term, ut , is
included. Since price indexes are not monetary measures the intercept, b0 , and
coefﬁcient, b1 , may be different from their implied values of zero and one,
respectively, in Eq. (1).
pM À et ¼ b0 þ b1 pt þ ut :
t

ð2Þ

Testing for purchasing power parity is not as simple as Eq. (2) might suggest,
because price levels and nominal exchange rates are often integrated of order one,
thus the regression results may be spurious. However, if purchasing power parity
holds then there is a stable, long-term relationship between the price levels in the
two countries when expressed in terms of a common currency. That is the two
common currency price levels must be cointegrated if the individual series are I(1)
with Eq. (2) expressing the long-run relationship.
Unit root test results, discussed below, indicate that the Mexican and US price
single equation approaches to testing for cointegration include the error correction
model (ECM) and the autoregressive distributed lag (ADL) variant. However, it is
well known that such testing is problematic because of the presence of nuisance
parameters (Pesavento 2004) and the dependence of the distribution of the relevant
test statistic on the variables included in the model. The distribution will vary, for
example, with the location of a structural break, an issue of particular importance in
this study. A researcher can bootstrap errors to uncover the empirical distribution,
but bootstrapping may also create some difﬁculties. Harris and Judge (1998) show
that bootstrapped errors may result in poor test size in a model with both stationary
and nonstationary covariates and at least one cointegrating vector, particularly in
small samples.
Enders, Im, and Lee offer an alternative to bootstrapping in evaluating the test
statistics from ECM and ADL models. They propose using stationary instrumental
variables for any I(1) series in the models. They show that the test statistics from the
ECM and ADL estimations are asymptotically normal when the nonstationary
variables are appropriately instrumented.1 Test statistics are free of the nuisance
parameter problem and can be evaluated using the standard normal distribution, thus
simplifying inference in cointegration models.
The EIL methodology is followed in this paper. Letting the Mexican price level
denominated in dollars be denoted ftM , that is pM À et ¼ ftM , the basic ECM is given
t
by Eq. (3):


M
b
b
ð3Þ
DftM ¼ d0 þ d1 ftÀ1 À b 0 À b 1 ptÀ1 þ d2 Dpt þ mt ;
where D is the difference operator, the ^ above a term indicates an estimated value,
the expression in parentheses is the estimated residual, btÀ1 , from Eq. (2) lagged
u
one period, that is the error correction term, and mt is a white noise error. This
speciﬁcation assumes that the US price level is weakly exogenous thus all adjustments to the error correction term occur in the dollar-denominated Mexican price
level. The US economy is much larger than that of Mexico so the weak exogeneity
assumption seems reasonable; nonetheless it is tested before estimation of Eq. (3).
Lags of DftM can be added to Eq. (3) to address autocorrelation and dummy
variables can be introduced as needed. The innovation of EIL is to show that
instrumenting btÀ1 and any other nonstationary covariates in the model yields test
u
statistics that are asymptotically normally distributed. As an instrument for any
nonstationary I(1) covariate, xtÀ1 , they propose using the m period difference,
xtÀ1 À xtÀmÀ1 . For example, in the basic ECM given by Eq. (3) the instrument for
btÀ1 would be btÀ1 À btÀmÀ1 . No theoretical guidance is provided for selecting m,
u
u
u
but EIL suggest using the value of m that minimizes the sum of the squared
residuals of the test equation. Empirical results from speciﬁcations for a range of
values of m are reported below. The ADL variation of Eq. (3) is given by Eq. (4).

Selection of the appropriate IV is addressed below. A concise description of the EIL methodology can
be found in Wallace (2013). The reader interested in a more complete description and proofs should

b
b
dummies and lags of the dependent variable can be introduced. In the case of the
M
M
basic ADL model in Eq. (4) the instruments are ftÀ1 À ftÀmÀ1 and ptÀ1 À ptÀmÀ1 for
M
the nonstationary series ftÀ1 and ptÀ1 , respectively. Of interest in testing for purchasing power parity is the coefﬁcient d1 in Eqs. (3) and (4). If the price levels in
terms of US dollars in the two countries are cointegrated, then b1 will be signiﬁd
cantly negative so that the null and alternative hypotheses are
H0 : d1 ! 0; H1 : d1 \0. The coefﬁcient on the error correction term will be negative
and signiﬁcant if the short run change in the dollar-denominated Mexican price
level responds to deviations from the long-run relation. For example, if btÀ1 is
u
positive it signiﬁes that the Mexican price level measured in dollars is above its
long-run equilibrium value relative to the US price level. If PPP holds the Mexican
price level should decline in the short run so the coefﬁcient on btÀ1 will be sigu
niﬁcantly negative. Correctly assessing the signiﬁcance of a coefﬁcient from the
ECM or ADL speciﬁcations with integrated regressors is the difﬁculty addressed by
the EIL procedure.

4 Data
The updated VGW data set used in this study includes three different price index
measures for Mexico. One price level series is the wholesale price index for Mexico
City available for 1930m01–2000m12. Wholesale prices for Mexico City are the
only historical data available for the country prior to 1969. A second (third) price
level series is derived by appending the producer price index excluding (including)
petroleum for 2001m01–2014m09 to the Mexico City wholesale price level. The
nominal exchange rate is expressed as the peso price of a US dollar. The US
producer price index series is taken from the statistical database of the Federal
´
Reserve Bank of St. Louis. All other data are drawn from Cardenas (1994), annual
Banxico reports, and the website for the Bank of Mexico. More details can be found
in Ventosa et al. The data are plotted in Figs. 1, 2, 3, and 4. Due to the similarity of
the producer price series with and without the price of petroleum, only the series
inclusive of the oil price is shown. All series display trends; thus, a deterministic
trend is included in the unit root and cointegration tests discussed below.
The augmented Dickey–Fuller test, the GLS detrended version of the Dickey–
Fuller test, and the KPSS test are employed to check for stationarity of all series.2
The ADF and GLS version of the Dickey–Fuller test statistics indicate failure to
reject the unit root null in the three Mexican price level series, the US price level,
and the nominal exchange rate. These two tests uniformly reject the unit root null in
the ﬁrst difference of each series at the 5% level or better indicating that the ﬁve

Tests on the logged series in levels include a constant and trend. Tests on the ﬁrst differenced logged
series include only a constant since plots of the differenced series do not show trends. The Schwarz

variables are integrated of order one. The Kwiatkowski, Phillips, Schmidt and Shin
(KPSS) indicate rejections of the trend stationary null in both levels and ﬁrst
differences at the 5% level for the three Mexican price-level measures. Thus, the
KPSS tests suggest that these three series are integrated of order two or higher.
According to the KPSS test, the nominal exchange rate and the US price level are
I(1) conﬁrming the earlier ﬁnding.3
Structural breaks in the data set are likely especially since Mexico has
experienced regime shifts since 1933. From 1933 to 1980 the nominal exchange rate
was generally ﬁxed interrupted by brief interludes of ﬂoating rates. Subsequently,
the nominal exchange rate was allowed to ﬂuctuate beginning with a managed ﬂoat.

Since 1995 the Mexican government has allowed the peso/dollar rate to ﬂuctuate
with occasional interventions. In the mid-1980s trade policy shifted from a
historical focus on import substitution to a more recent emphasis on exports.
The Lee and Strazicich (2003, 2013) henceforth LS, unit root test is used to test
the null of a unit root in each series while allowing for structural breaks. Up to 40
lags are permitted with a general-to-simple procedure used to select lag length. The
test is performed allowing for one or two breaks in both trend and intercept. The null
hypothesis of a unit root with break cannot be rejected for any of the logged series
under either number of breaks. Since no trend can be observed in the ﬁrst
differenced series, only intercept breaks are considered in testing for a second unit
root. The null of a second unit root cannot be rejected for any of the three
differenced Mexican price series allowing for one break; but when two breaks are
break version of the LS test for the logged Mexican price series, most of the
evidence from unit root tests suggest that all series are integrated of ﬁrst order and
the remainder of the work is conducted under that assumption.

5 Results
The assumption of weak exogeneity of the US producer price index is tested in a
vector ECM before proceeding with the EIL estimations. The Johansen test for
cointegration indicates the presence of one cointegrating vector between the logs of
the dollar-denominated Mexican price level and the US producer price index,
regardless of the choice of Mexican price series. The Schwarz Bayesian criterion
selects seven lags for a vector autoregression of the two variables so six are included
in one version of the VECM. Another version of the VECM uses 12 lags of the
endogenous variables to capture possible seasonal effects. Tests for autocorrelation
indicate that the problem remains in the six lag VECM, but that autocorrelation is
eliminated for the 12-lag version. All results reported below are based on the VECM
with 12 lags.
The VECM, shown in Eqs. (5) and (6) below, has two endogenous variables, the
change in the log of the dollar-denominated Mexican price level, DftM , and the
change in the log of the US producer price index, Dpt . The error correction portion
is the term in parenthesis in both equations.

Weak exogeneity of the log of the US producer price index holds if the
coefﬁcient on the error correction term in Eq. (6), a2, is not signiﬁcantly different
from zero. Three VECM are estimated, each using the dollar-denominated Mexican
price level constructed from a different Mexican price series. Likelihood ratio tests
of the null hypothesis a2 = 0 have marginal signiﬁcance levels ranging from 0.15 to
0.19 indicating failure to reject the null thus support for the weak exogeneity
assumption.
Initial estimation of both the ECM and the ADL versions (Eqs. 3 and 4) using
data for 1930m01–2014m09 shows that identifying empirical speciﬁcations of the
ECM and ADL equations without autocorrelation requires the inclusion of very long
lags of the dependent variable, regardless of the price index measure used.
Interestingly, the need for long lags is obviated if the ﬁrst 39 months of data are
excluded from the sample; a speciﬁcation with 12 lags of the dependent variable
the scope of the paper to investigate the reason(s) that removal of the ﬁrst 39 months
of data alters the speciﬁcation so dramatically, but it may be due to unusual
exchange rate or price level behavior caused by the removal of gold from circulation
and the prohibition of the coinage of silver in Mexico during this period (see
Wallace 1999 and sources cited therein). All estimation results reported below are
for speciﬁcations of Eqs. (3) and (4) that include 12 lags of the dependent variable.
Table 1 reports the estimated value of d1 from the ECM in column 2 of the
table and its estimated values in the IV speciﬁcations for m = 14…24 in subsequent
columns. The ﬁrst column shows the error correction term used in the ECM. Zmex1
M
M
b
b
is (ftÀ1 À b 0 À b 1 ptÀ1 ) in Eq. (3) when ftÀ1 is calculated using the price index for
Mexico that includes petroleum, and zmex2 is the error correction in Eq. (3) where
the price index for Mexico excludes petroleum. Thus zmex1 and zmex2 are the
estimated residuals obtained from the full sample, 1933m03–2014m09 estimations
of Eq. (2). Zmex3 is the error correction term in Eq. (3) when using the wholesale
price index for Mexico City for the period 1933m03 to 2000m12 to estimate Eq. (2).
The estimated value of d1 is negative and signiﬁcant at the 1% level in the basic
ECM, regardless of the particular Mexican price level series, indicating cointegration between the dollar-denominated Mexican and US price levels thus evidence of
PPP. The remaining columns show estimates of d1 when error correction terms are
instrumented for values of m ranging from 14 to 24. The choice of m has some effect
on the size of b1 , but all are signiﬁcant at the 5% level (critical value -1.645) and
d
all but ﬁve of the estimated coefﬁcients are signiﬁcant at the 1% level. Thus, the
results indicate that the US and Mexican price levels, denominated in dollars, are
cointegrated a result supportive of purchasing power parity. The choice of Mexican
price index used in the estimations makes very little difference in the results, for a
given value of m the different indexes produce very similar estimates of d1 . The
estimated coefﬁcient in bold and italicized font in the table is from the equation
having the smallest sum of squared residuals (SSR) for the 11 IV speciﬁcations. The
smallest SSR appears at the ﬁnal value, m = 24, in the three different estimations.
In the ADL version of the empirical model d1 is the coefﬁcient on the lagged
M
value of the dollar-denominated Mexican price level, ftÀ1 . There are three different
measures of the dollar-denominated price level in Mexico in Table 1: fmex1
includes the price of petroleum, fmex2 excludes petroleum price, and fmex3 is the
wholesale price index for Mexico City. The two former measures span 1933m03 to
2014m09 while fmex3 ends in 2000m12. The estimated coefﬁcients on the dollardenominated Mexican price-level measures are displayed in Table 2. The basic
ADL results, without instruments, suggest cointegration of the Mexican and US

Once it was determined that the ﬁrst few years of the study were responsible for difﬁculties in ﬁnding a
satisfactory speciﬁcation and those years eliminated, a general-to-simple procedure was followed.
Starting with a speciﬁcation for the ECM and ADL with 37 lags of the dependent variable, Wald tests for
joint signiﬁcance of the longest lags were carried out eliminating those lags that were not jointly
signiﬁcant at the 15% level or higher. Six different LM tests, gradually reducing the number of lags in the
LM test, were undertaken for each ECM and ADL speciﬁcation (without instruments). For both ADL and
ECM 12 lags of DftM were sufﬁcient to eliminate autocorrelation. Twelve lags were then imposed on the

The 5% critical value for the ECMs without IVs is -3.218 and the 1% critical value is -3.804. The critical values are obtained using the response surfaces in Ericsson
and MacKinnon (2002), as implemented in the program ECMtest.xls, version 1.0 (Ericsson and MacKinnon 2000). Since the test statistics from the IV estimations are
asymptotically normal, the signiﬁcant values are -1.645 at the 5% level and -2.327 at the 1% level

Critical values for the ADL model without IVs are based on the t statistic bounds test (unrestricted intercept, no trend) of Pesaran et al. (2001). A t statistic smaller than
the I(1) bound of -3.53 (-4.10) indicates signiﬁcance at the 5% (1%) level. The coefﬁcient italicized in bold font is from the equation that minimizes the sum of the

Table 2 Estimation results for the coefﬁcient on the dollar-denominated Mexican price level: ADL model with and without instruments
includes the same variables as the ECM so it is surprising that none of the b1 in the
d
IV speciﬁcations are signiﬁcant; none of the test statistics are close to their normal
distribution critical values. Apart from the signiﬁcant coefﬁcients on the three
Mexican price-level measures in the ADL model without instruments, there is no
evidence for purchasing power parity in the ADL results.
Long-span data are necessary for purchasing power parity tests because PPP is a
long-run condition and because empirical evidence indicates that deviations from
PPP have long half-lives.5 As previously noted structural breaks arising from
monetary policy, exchange rate, or trade policy regime changes are likely given the
long time period spanned by the data. GVW argue that the commercial opening of
Mexico, especially in the 1980s, likely changed the Mexico–US real exchange rate.
They ﬁnd evidence of PPP when allowing for mean shifts that they attribute to
regime changes.
The contradictory results for the instrumented ECM and ADL estimations raise
the question of whether structural breaks might explain the differences. This issue is
investigated by including dummy variables to allow for mean shifts attributable to
the structural breaks identiﬁed in GVW and VGW. The VGW approach identiﬁes
one break in the innovation variance and this occurs in July 1976. GVW ﬁnd
multiple breaks in the monthly mean real exchange rate during the 1969–2010
period. Dummies for the ﬁve breaks identiﬁed in Model D-5 of GVW and the single
break in July 1976 are now included in the ECM and ADL models of Eqs. (3) and
(4). Wald tests on the estimated dummy variable coefﬁcients of the ECM and ADL
models indicate that the dummies for 1979m12 and 1982m12 are jointly
insigniﬁcant, so they are dropped from the ECM and ADL speciﬁcations as well
as the IV estimations regardless of the Mexican price index used. Although the
1976m07 dummy is not signiﬁcant in all estimations, it is signiﬁcantly different
from zero at the 5% level in some instances thus retained in all models. The ﬁnal
versions of the ECM and ADL models add dummies allowing intercept breaks in
1976m07, 1985m06, 1987m12, and 1998m09 to the earlier versions of Eqs. (3) and
(4). Results are reported in Tables 3 (ECM) and 4 (ADL).
The inclusion of the dummy variables causes small changes in the estimated
coefﬁcients displayed in Table 1. The coefﬁcients are now slightly smaller, but, as
in the speciﬁcation without dummy variables, all are signiﬁcant regardless of the
Mexican price index used and choice of m for the instrumental variable. Thus the
same qualitative conclusion is obtained as from the instrumented ECM estimations
without dummies; there is cointegration of the two common currency price levels,
thus evidence of PPP.
Including four dummy variables changes the ADL results with instruments and
leads to a different conclusion regarding purchasing power parity. As in the
speciﬁcations without dummy variables the estimated value of d1 is negative in the

Estimating half-lives is beyond the scope of this study, but estimates vary widely. VGW, using virtually
the same data set as in this study ﬁnd half-lives ranging from 1.37 to 2.41 years for Mexico depending on
the time period studied. Rogoff (1996) surveys the literature on PPP and ﬁnds half-life estimates of

measures. When using instruments, b1 is signiﬁcantly negative at the 5% level
d
for all values of m and of comparable size to the estimated d1 in the corresponding
ECM.6 The ADL speciﬁcations with dummies suggest the change in the dollardenominated price level in Mexico is negatively related to its long-run level the
previous month, evidence that it adjusts to its purchasing power parity value. The
signiﬁcance of most of the time period dummies suggests that this long-run value
has shifted over time. As in the ECM speciﬁcations, the sum of the squared residuals
is minimized at the highest value of m used to create the instruments regardless of
the Mexican price level variable used in the estimation.
The signiﬁcant dummy variables show that the relationship of the dollardenominated price levels of Mexico and the US underwent mean shifts during the
study period. Ex post it is easy to ﬁnd events that might cause mean shifts in the
relationship of the price levels of the two countries, but proving causality is
`
impossible. Nonetheless, there are some likely candidates. Ventosa-Santaularia
et al. associate a break in the innovation variance in July 1976 with macroeconomic
difﬁculties in Mexico culminating in a shift from a ﬁxed nominal exchange rate vis`
´
a-vis the US dollar to a managed ﬂoat in September 1976. Gomez et al. note that a
policy shift toward a more open economy in Mexico began in the 1980s with
membership in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the start of
negotiations for the North American Free Trade Agreement. Such a policy shift,
they argue, would lead to a change in the traded/non-traded goods mix and cause a
real exchange rate shift.

6 Summary and conclusions
The evidence on purchasing power parity in Mexico is mixed. Some researchers ﬁnd
that PPP holds, others do not, and others argue that it holds but that structural shifts
in the relation have occurred. A recent approach to cointegration developed by
Enders, Im, and Lee is used to test for PPP between the United States and Mexico.
The EIL procedure uses stationary variables as instruments for nonstationary
covariates in the error correction and ADL models. When instruments are used the
test statistics are asymptotically normally distributed thus eliminating the nuisance
parameter problem and avoiding the need to bootstrap errors.
Initial estimation of the basic ECM and its ADL variant yields conﬂicting
evidence regarding PPP. All ECM speciﬁcations, instrumented or not, support the
PPP hypothesis; none of the ADL speciﬁcations with instruments do. Since other
researchers have found evidence of mean shifts in the Mexico–US exchange rate,
dummy variables for six exogenously imposed breaks are included in the empirical
models. Coefﬁcients on four of the six breaks are signiﬁcant in at least one variant
6

As a robustness check on the results, both the error correction and autoregressive distributed lag models
are also re-estimated replacing the four intercept break dummies with intercept and trend-shift dummies
at dates identiﬁed by the Lee–Strazicich unit root tests. Results are very similar to those shown in
dummies provide evidence of PPP, as do the ECM without dummies. Interestingly,
the ADL models with instruments and dummies also support PPP; all coefﬁcients on
the dollar-denominated Mexican price level are signiﬁcantly negative, unlike the
speciﬁcations without dummies. Overall the evidence indicates that PPP holds for
the 1933m03–2014m09 period between the US and Mexico, but that the purchasing
power parity relation between the two countries has changed over this time period.

Abstract A new approach to cointegration developed by Enders et al. (Cointegration tests using instrumental variables with an example of the U.K. demand for
money. Unpublished working paper. http://wenders.people.ua.edu/time-seriesmethods.html, 2008) is applied to long-span, high-frequency data to test for purchasing power parity in the Mexico–US real exchange rate. Overall the empirical
results suggest that purchasing power parity (PPP) holds for the study period. The
evidence for PPP is stronger when structural breaks are allowed in the real exchange
rate.

1 Introduction
Absolute purchasing power parity (PPP) between two countries holds if the cost of a
market basket of tradable goods and services is the same in both countries in terms
of a common currency. If there are no barriers to trade or transactions costs, any
differences in the cost of the market basket are eliminated through arbitrage.
Interestingly, Cassel (1918) advanced the PPP hypothesis as the norm under the

Department of Economics and Finance, Gulf University for Science and Technology,
in Sweden and its trading partners as arising from trade barriers.
Empirical testing of PPP presents some difﬁculties, but surmountable ones. First,
there are no data on the costs of a market basket of tradable goods and services.
Instead researchers use price indexes, but indexes contain data on non-traded goods
and services that are irrelevant in testing for PPP. Second, price indexes and
nominal exchange rates are constructed by the averaging of observations drawn at
different times and/or different locations. Such averaging can introduce bias into
unit root tests for PPP (Taylor 2001). Third, evidence of mean reversion of the real
exchange rate is regarded as evidence of purchasing power parity, but there is no
guarantee that the mean to which a real exchange rate measure constructed using
price indexes reverts is the PPP level. Of course there is no theoretical basis for
mean reversion to a real rate different from the one associated with PPP either.
Purchasing power parity in the real exchange rate between Mexico and the
United States is examined in this study. Focus on this bilateral relation is justiﬁed
because most of Mexico’s international trade has historically been with the US. This
paper extends previous work on PPP for the Mexico–US relationship in two
important ways. First, it makes use of the long-span, high-frequency data set
`
developed by Ventosa-Santaularia et al. (2015), henceforth VGW, and updated to
2014. Wallace et al. (2011) used the 1930–1960 portion of this data set to test for
´
PPP and Gomez-Zaldivar et al. (2013) studied PPP in Mexico with the data for
1969–2010, but this paper is the ﬁrst after VGW to utilize the complete data set.
Second, the study employs a recent approach to cointegration testing developed by
Enders et al. (2008) to examine the PPP hypothesis. The Enders, Im, and Lee
(henceforth EIL) methodology uses stationary instrumental variables for the
integrated series of the empirical model to overcome the difﬁculties of inference
posed by non-standard distributions of nonstationary variables. EIL show that the t
statistics of the estimated model are asymptotically normal when nonstationary
regressors are instrumented with stationary ones.
Taylor (2001) shows that bias against the PPP hypothesis can arise in tests of
stationarity of the real exchange rate due to temporal aggregation of high-frequency
data in the construction of the lower frequency price indexes. He demonstrates that
the bias reduces the power of unit root tests, but ﬁnds that bias diminishes with
longer data spans. In light of Taylor’s work most studies of purchasing power parity
have focused on industrial countries likely due to the availability of data over
extended spans. The long-span data set used in this study, thus, mitigates the bias
arising from temporal aggregation allowing tests of PPP for Mexico, a nation whose
economic development has lagged that of the industrial countries.
The long-span high-frequency data set put together by VGW and updated for this
study is a composite from several different sources. Monthly, historical nominal
exchange rate and price index data for Mexico, 1930–1960, are obtained from
´
Cardenas (1994) who cites the Bank of Mexico as a source, although the central
bank does not provide these historical ﬁgures through its statistical website. Post1960 data are from annual reports of the Bank of Mexico, commonly referred to as
Due to the large number of PPP studies, this review focuses only on PPP research
´
for Mexico. In studying real exchange rate variability and GDP in Mexico Avalos
´
Huerta and Hernandez Trillo (1995) fail to ﬁnd evidence of PPP in annual or
quarterly data for the Mexico–US real exchange rate for 1961–1994. McLeod and
Welch (1992) apply unit root and cointegration tests to quarterly data for the
Mexico–US real exchange rate, 1960–1991. They ﬁnd evidence of stationarity of
the real rate and cointegration of the nominal exchange rate and price levels, results
normally regarded as evidence of PPP between two countries. Despite their ﬁnding
McLeod and Welch express skepticism regarding the presence of PPP. Santaella and
Vela (2005) provide an excellent description and analysis of nominal exchange rate
´
policy in Mexico during the tumultuous period of 1987–1994. Mejıa Reyes and
´
´˜
Gonzalez Nunez (1996) test for absolute purchasing power parity in three measures
of the Mexico–US real exchange rate. Two of the real exchange rate measures are
constructed using annual data from 1940 to 1994 and the third for 1921–1994. The
three measures differ in the price indexes used to calculate the real exchange rate.
´
Using augmented Dickey–Fuller and Phillips–Perron unit root tests Mejıa Reyes and
´
´˜
Gonzalez Nunez ﬁnd weak evidence of stationarity of the real rate, thus support for
the PPP hypothesis, in the three series. They also apply the Engle–Granger tests to
the three series and conclude that the Mexican and US price levels are cointegrated
for both of the time periods studied although the evidence is weaker for 1921–1994.
Evidence from Johansen’s cointegration test provides weak evidence of PPP only
for the 1921–1994 period.
Hegwood and Papell (1998) argue that PPP requires reversion of the real
exchange rate to a constant mean. Unit root tests showing stationarity of the real
exchange rate in the presence of breaks are not evidence of PPP if shifts in the series
imply reversion to a changing mean. They deﬁne such instances of reversion to an
occasionally changing mean as quasi-purchasing power parity or QPPP. Noriega
and Medina (2003) test for PPP in annual data for the peso–dollar real exchange rate
for 1925–1994 allowing for an unknown number of structural breaks in the data.
Noriega and Medina ﬁnd that a structural break in the mean real exchange rate
occurred in 1981; but the rate is stationary both before and after this date, evidence
of QPPP.
Taylor (2002) tests for purchasing power parity in a data set composed of more
than 100 annual observations for 20 countries, including Mexico. His tests indicate
mean reversion, evidence of PPP, in Mexico and most of the other countries studied.
Several other studies have applied different stationarity tests to the Taylor data and
ﬁnd support for PPP in most countries including Mexico (Wallace and Shelley
2006; Bahmani-Oskooee et al. 2007; Wallace 2008, 2013).
´
Gomez-Zaldivar et al. (2013) use a unit root test developed by Kapetanios (2005)
allowing multiple, exogenously determined breaks to test for PPP in monthly data
for the Mexico–US real exchange rate, 1969–2010. They test an empirical model
allowing for a break in the mean, without trend, and another with breaks in the mean
alternatives reject the unit root null in favor of a stationary series with breaks. Most
of the breaks occurred between 1982 and 1987, a period associated with shifts
toward opening Mexico to additional foreign investment and expanding international trade.
As ﬁgure 1 in Ventosa et al. shows, the Mexico–US real exchange has been
volatile over the period 1930–2012, but the volatility is most pronounced in the
decade beginning 1980 during which exchange rate controls were adopted and
banks nationalized (Wallace 1999 provides a summary of events). VGW apply the
Kim, Leybourne, and Newbold unit root test which is robust to volatility changes
and ﬁnd evidence of purchasing power parity for the Mexico–US real exchange rate.
The test also reveals a structural break in the error variance occurring in July 1976,
shortly before Mexico switched from a ﬁxed nominal exchange rate regime to a
managed ﬂoat.

3 Methodology
If purchasing power parity holds between Mexico and the United States then Eq. (1)
follows:
cM À et ¼ ct ;
t

ð1Þ

where cM is the log of the cost of a market basket of tradable goods and services
t
denominated in Mexican pesos, ct is the log of the US dollar cost of the same market
basket in the United States, and et is the log of the nominal exchange rate in pesos
per US dollar.
As noted earlier, tests of PPP use price indexes rather than actual costs of a
market basket. Price indexes do not correspond to the cost terms in Eq. (1).
Consequently, an empirical test of PPP must modify the relationship yielding
À Á
Eq. (2), where the logged period t price indexes for Mexico pM and the United
t
States ðpt Þ replace the costs of the market basket in Eq. (1) and an error term, ut , is
included. Since price indexes are not monetary measures the intercept, b0 , and

Testing for purchasing power parity is not as simple as Eq. (2) might suggest,
because price levels and nominal exchange rates are often integrated of order one,
thus the regression results may be spurious. However, if purchasing power parity
holds then there is a stable, long-term relationship between the price levels in the
two countries when expressed in terms of a common currency. That is the two
common currency price levels must be cointegrated if the individual series are I(1)
with Eq. (2) expressing the long-run relationship.
Unit root test results, discussed below, indicate that the Mexican and US price
single equation approaches to testing for cointegration include the error correction
model (ECM) and the autoregressive distributed lag (ADL) variant. However, it is
well known that such testing is problematic because of the presence of nuisance
parameters (Pesavento 2004) and the dependence of the distribution of the relevant
test statistic on the variables included in the model. The distribution will vary, for
example, with the location of a structural break, an issue of particular importance in
this study. A researcher can bootstrap errors to uncover the empirical distribution,
but bootstrapping may also create some difﬁculties. Harris and Judge (1998) show
that bootstrapped errors may result in poor test size in a model with both stationary
and nonstationary covariates and at least one cointegrating vector, particularly in
small samples.
Enders, Im, and Lee offer an alternative to bootstrapping in evaluating the test
statistics from ECM and ADL models. They propose using stationary instrumental
variables for any I(1) series in the models. They show that the test statistics from the
ECM and ADL estimations are asymptotically normal when the nonstationary
variables are appropriately instrumented.1 Test statistics are free of the nuisance
parameter problem and can be evaluated using the standard normal distribution, thus
simplifying inference in cointegration models.
The EIL methodology is followed in this paper. Letting the Mexican price level
denominated in dollars be denoted ftM , that is pM À et ¼ ftM , the basic ECM is given
t
by Eq. (3):


ð3Þ
DftM ¼ d0 þ d1 ftÀ1 À b 0 À b 1 ptÀ1 þ d2 Dpt þ mt ;
where D is the difference operator, the ^ above a term indicates an estimated value,
the expression in parentheses is the estimated residual, btÀ1 , from Eq. (2) lagged
u
one period, that is the error correction term, and mt is a white noise error. This
speciﬁcation assumes that the US price level is weakly exogenous thus all adjustments to the error correction term occur in the dollar-denominated Mexican price
level. The US economy is much larger than that of Mexico so the weak exogeneity
assumption seems reasonable; nonetheless it is tested before estimation of Eq. (3).
Lags of DftM can be added to Eq. (3) to address autocorrelation and dummy
variables can be introduced as needed. The innovation of EIL is to show that
instrumenting btÀ1 and any other nonstationary covariates in the model yields test
u
statistics that are asymptotically normally distributed. As an instrument for any
nonstationary I(1) covariate, xtÀ1 , they propose using the m period difference,
xtÀ1 À xtÀmÀ1 . For example, in the basic ECM given by Eq. (3) the instrument for
btÀ1 would be btÀ1 À btÀmÀ1 . No theoretical guidance is provided for selecting m,
u
u
u
but EIL suggest using the value of m that minimizes the sum of the squared
residuals of the test equation. Empirical results from speciﬁcations for a range of
values of m are reported below. The ADL variation of Eq. (3) is given by Eq. (4).

basic ADL model in Eq. (4) the instruments are ftÀ1 À ftÀmÀ1 and ptÀ1 À ptÀmÀ1 for
M
the nonstationary series ftÀ1 and ptÀ1 , respectively. Of interest in testing for purchasing power parity is the coefﬁcient d1 in Eqs. (3) and (4). If the price levels in
terms of US dollars in the two countries are cointegrated, then b1 will be signiﬁd
cantly negative so that the null and alternative hypotheses are
H0 : d1 ! 0; H1 : d1 \0. The coefﬁcient on the error correction term will be negative
and signiﬁcant if the short run change in the dollar-denominated Mexican price
level responds to deviations from the long-run relation. For example, if btÀ1 is
u
positive it signiﬁes that the Mexican price level measured in dollars is above its
long-run equilibrium value relative to the US price level. If PPP holds the Mexican
price level should decline in the short run so the coefﬁcient on btÀ1 will be sigu
niﬁcantly negative. Correctly assessing the signiﬁcance of a coefﬁcient from the
ECM or ADL speciﬁcations with integrated regressors is the difﬁculty addressed by
the EIL procedure.

4 Data
The updated VGW data set used in this study includes three different price index
measures for Mexico. One price level series is the wholesale price index for Mexico
City available for 1930m01–2000m12. Wholesale prices for Mexico City are the
only historical data available for the country prior to 1969. A second (third) price
level series is derived by appending the producer price index excluding (including)
petroleum for 2001m01–2014m09 to the Mexico City wholesale price level. The
nominal exchange rate is expressed as the peso price of a US dollar. The US
producer price index series is taken from the statistical database of the Federal
´
Reserve Bank of St. Louis. All other data are drawn from Cardenas (1994), annual
Banxico reports, and the website for the Bank of Mexico. More details can be found
in Ventosa et al. The data are plotted in Figs. 1, 2, 3, and 4. Due to the similarity of
the producer price series with and without the price of petroleum, only the series
inclusive of the oil price is shown. All series display trends; thus, a deterministic
trend is included in the unit root and cointegration tests discussed below.
The augmented Dickey–Fuller test, the GLS detrended version of the Dickey–
Fuller test, and the KPSS test are employed to check for stationarity of all series.2
The ADF and GLS version of the Dickey–Fuller test statistics indicate failure to
reject the unit root null in the three Mexican price level series, the US price level,
and the nominal exchange rate. These two tests uniformly reject the unit root null in
the ﬁrst difference of each series at the 5% level or better indicating that the ﬁve

variables are integrated of order one. The Kwiatkowski, Phillips, Schmidt and Shin
(KPSS) indicate rejections of the trend stationary null in both levels and ﬁrst
differences at the 5% level for the three Mexican price-level measures. Thus, the
KPSS tests suggest that these three series are integrated of order two or higher.
According to the KPSS test, the nominal exchange rate and the US price level are
I(1) conﬁrming the earlier ﬁnding.3
Structural breaks in the data set are likely especially since Mexico has
experienced regime shifts since 1933. From 1933 to 1980 the nominal exchange rate
was generally ﬁxed interrupted by brief interludes of ﬂoating rates. Subsequently,
the nominal exchange rate was allowed to ﬂuctuate beginning with a managed ﬂoat.

Since 1995 the Mexican government has allowed the peso/dollar rate to ﬂuctuate
with occasional interventions. In the mid-1980s trade policy shifted from a
historical focus on import substitution to a more recent emphasis on exports.
The Lee and Strazicich (2003, 2013) henceforth LS, unit root test is used to test
the null of a unit root in each series while allowing for structural breaks. Up to 40
lags are permitted with a general-to-simple procedure used to select lag length. The
test is performed allowing for one or two breaks in both trend and intercept. The null
hypothesis of a unit root with break cannot be rejected for any of the logged series
under either number of breaks. Since no trend can be observed in the ﬁrst
differenced series, only intercept breaks are considered in testing for a second unit
root. The null of a second unit root cannot be rejected for any of the three
differenced Mexican price series allowing for one break; but when two breaks are
break version of the LS test for the logged Mexican price series, most of the
evidence from unit root tests suggest that all series are integrated of ﬁrst order and
the remainder of the work is conducted under that assumption.

5 Results
The assumption of weak exogeneity of the US producer price index is tested in a
vector ECM before proceeding with the EIL estimations. The Johansen test for
cointegration indicates the presence of one cointegrating vector between the logs of
the dollar-denominated Mexican price level and the US producer price index,
regardless of the choice of Mexican price series. The Schwarz Bayesian criterion
selects seven lags for a vector autoregression of the two variables so six are included
in one version of the VECM. Another version of the VECM uses 12 lags of the
endogenous variables to capture possible seasonal effects. Tests for autocorrelation
indicate that the problem remains in the six lag VECM, but that autocorrelation is
eliminated for the 12-lag version. All results reported below are based on the VECM
with 12 lags.
The VECM, shown in Eqs. (5) and (6) below, has two endogenous variables, the
change in the log of the dollar-denominated Mexican price level, DftM , and the
change in the log of the US producer price index, Dpt . The error correction portion
is the term in parenthesis in both equations.

Weak exogeneity of the log of the US producer price index holds if the
coefﬁcient on the error correction term in Eq. (6), a2, is not signiﬁcantly different
from zero. Three VECM are estimated, each using the dollar-denominated Mexican
price level constructed from a different Mexican price series. Likelihood ratio tests
of the null hypothesis a2 = 0 have marginal signiﬁcance levels ranging from 0.15 to
0.19 indicating failure to reject the null thus support for the weak exogeneity
assumption.
Initial estimation of both the ECM and the ADL versions (Eqs. 3 and 4) using
data for 1930m01–2014m09 shows that identifying empirical speciﬁcations of the
ECM and ADL equations without autocorrelation requires the inclusion of very long
lags of the dependent variable, regardless of the price index measure used.
Interestingly, the need for long lags is obviated if the ﬁrst 39 months of data are
excluded from the sample; a speciﬁcation with 12 lags of the dependent variable
the scope of the paper to investigate the reason(s) that removal of the ﬁrst 39 months
of data alters the speciﬁcation so dramatically, but it may be due to unusual
exchange rate or price level behavior caused by the removal of gold from circulation
and the prohibition of the coinage of silver in Mexico during this period (see
Wallace 1999 and sources cited therein). All estimation results reported below are
for speciﬁcations of Eqs. (3) and (4) that include 12 lags of the dependent variable.
Table 1 reports the estimated value of d1 from the ECM in column 2 of the
table and its estimated values in the IV speciﬁcations for m = 14…24 in subsequent
columns. The ﬁrst column shows the error correction term used in the ECM. Zmex1
M
M
b
b
is (ftÀ1 À b 0 À b 1 ptÀ1 ) in Eq. (3) when ftÀ1 is calculated using the price index for
Mexico that includes petroleum, and zmex2 is the error correction in Eq. (3) where
the price index for Mexico excludes petroleum. Thus zmex1 and zmex2 are the
estimated residuals obtained from the full sample, 1933m03–2014m09 estimations
of Eq. (2). Zmex3 is the error correction term in Eq. (3) when using the wholesale
price index for Mexico City for the period 1933m03 to 2000m12 to estimate Eq. (2).
The estimated value of d1 is negative and signiﬁcant at the 1% level in the basic
ECM, regardless of the particular Mexican price level series, indicating cointegration between the dollar-denominated Mexican and US price levels thus evidence of
PPP. The remaining columns show estimates of d1 when error correction terms are
instrumented for values of m ranging from 14 to 24. The choice of m has some effect
on the size of b1 , but all are signiﬁcant at the 5% level (critical value -1.645) and
d
all but ﬁve of the estimated coefﬁcients are signiﬁcant at the 1% level. Thus, the
results indicate that the US and Mexican price levels, denominated in dollars, are
cointegrated a result supportive of purchasing power parity. The choice of Mexican
price index used in the estimations makes very little difference in the results, for a
given value of m the different indexes produce very similar estimates of d1 . The
estimated coefﬁcient in bold and italicized font in the table is from the equation
having the smallest sum of squared residuals (SSR) for the 11 IV speciﬁcations. The
smallest SSR appears at the ﬁnal value, m = 24, in the three different estimations.
In the ADL version of the empirical model d1 is the coefﬁcient on the lagged
M
value of the dollar-denominated Mexican price level, ftÀ1 . There are three different
measures of the dollar-denominated price level in Mexico in Table 1: fmex1
includes the price of petroleum, fmex2 excludes petroleum price, and fmex3 is the
wholesale price index for Mexico City. The two former measures span 1933m03 to
2014m09 while fmex3 ends in 2000m12. The estimated coefﬁcients on the dollardenominated Mexican price-level measures are displayed in Table 2. The basic
ADL results, without instruments, suggest cointegration of the Mexican and US

Once it was determined that the ﬁrst few years of the study were responsible for difﬁculties in ﬁnding a
satisfactory speciﬁcation and those years eliminated, a general-to-simple procedure was followed.
Starting with a speciﬁcation for the ECM and ADL with 37 lags of the dependent variable, Wald tests for
joint signiﬁcance of the longest lags were carried out eliminating those lags that were not jointly
signiﬁcant at the 15% level or higher. Six different LM tests, gradually reducing the number of lags in the
LM test, were undertaken for each ECM and ADL speciﬁcation (without instruments). For both ADL and
ECM 12 lags of DftM were sufﬁcient to eliminate autocorrelation. Twelve lags were then imposed on the

Table 2 Estimation results for the coefﬁcient on the dollar-denominated Mexican price level: ADL model with and without instruments
includes the same variables as the ECM so it is surprising that none of the b1 in the
d
IV speciﬁcations are signiﬁcant; none of the test statistics are close to their normal
distribution critical values. Apart from the signiﬁcant coefﬁcients on the three
Mexican price-level measures in the ADL model without instruments, there is no
evidence for purchasing power parity in the ADL results.
Long-span data are necessary for purchasing power parity tests because PPP is a
long-run condition and because empirical evidence indicates that deviations from
PPP have long half-lives.5 As previously noted structural breaks arising from
monetary policy, exchange rate, or trade policy regime changes are likely given the
long time period spanned by the data. GVW argue that the commercial opening of
Mexico, especially in the 1980s, likely changed the Mexico–US real exchange rate.
They ﬁnd evidence of PPP when allowing for mean shifts that they attribute to
regime changes.
The contradictory results for the instrumented ECM and ADL estimations raise
the question of whether structural breaks might explain the differences. This issue is
investigated by including dummy variables to allow for mean shifts attributable to
the structural breaks identiﬁed in GVW and VGW. The VGW approach identiﬁes
one break in the innovation variance and this occurs in July 1976. GVW ﬁnd
multiple breaks in the monthly mean real exchange rate during the 1969–2010
period. Dummies for the ﬁve breaks identiﬁed in Model D-5 of GVW and the single
break in July 1976 are now included in the ECM and ADL models of Eqs. (3) and
(4). Wald tests on the estimated dummy variable coefﬁcients of the ECM and ADL
models indicate that the dummies for 1979m12 and 1982m12 are jointly
insigniﬁcant, so they are dropped from the ECM and ADL speciﬁcations as well
as the IV estimations regardless of the Mexican price index used. Although the
1976m07 dummy is not signiﬁcant in all estimations, it is signiﬁcantly different
from zero at the 5% level in some instances thus retained in all models. The ﬁnal
versions of the ECM and ADL models add dummies allowing intercept breaks in
1976m07, 1985m06, 1987m12, and 1998m09 to the earlier versions of Eqs. (3) and
(4). Results are reported in Tables 3 (ECM) and 4 (ADL).
The inclusion of the dummy variables causes small changes in the estimated
coefﬁcients displayed in Table 1. The coefﬁcients are now slightly smaller, but, as
in the speciﬁcation without dummy variables, all are signiﬁcant regardless of the
Mexican price index used and choice of m for the instrumental variable. Thus the
same qualitative conclusion is obtained as from the instrumented ECM estimations
without dummies; there is cointegration of the two common currency price levels,
thus evidence of PPP.
Including four dummy variables changes the ADL results with instruments and
leads to a different conclusion regarding purchasing power parity. As in the
speciﬁcations without dummy variables the estimated value of d1 is negative in the
5

Estimating half-lives is beyond the scope of this study, but estimates vary widely. VGW, using virtually
the same data set as in this study ﬁnd half-lives ranging from 1.37 to 2.41 years for Mexico depending on
the time period studied. Rogoff (1996) surveys the literature on PPP and ﬁnds half-life estimates of

measures. When using instruments, b1 is signiﬁcantly negative at the 5% level
d
for all values of m and of comparable size to the estimated d1 in the corresponding
ECM.6 The ADL speciﬁcations with dummies suggest the change in the dollardenominated price level in Mexico is negatively related to its long-run level the
previous month, evidence that it adjusts to its purchasing power parity value. The
signiﬁcance of most of the time period dummies suggests that this long-run value
has shifted over time. As in the ECM speciﬁcations, the sum of the squared residuals
is minimized at the highest value of m used to create the instruments regardless of
the Mexican price level variable used in the estimation.
The signiﬁcant dummy variables show that the relationship of the dollardenominated price levels of Mexico and the US underwent mean shifts during the
study period. Ex post it is easy to ﬁnd events that might cause mean shifts in the
relationship of the price levels of the two countries, but proving causality is
`
impossible. Nonetheless, there are some likely candidates. Ventosa-Santaularia
et al. associate a break in the innovation variance in July 1976 with macroeconomic
difﬁculties in Mexico culminating in a shift from a ﬁxed nominal exchange rate vis`
´
a-vis the US dollar to a managed ﬂoat in September 1976. Gomez et al. note that a
policy shift toward a more open economy in Mexico began in the 1980s with
membership in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the start of
negotiations for the North American Free Trade Agreement. Such a policy shift,
they argue, would lead to a change in the traded/non-traded goods mix and cause a
real exchange rate shift.

6 Summary and conclusions
The evidence on purchasing power parity in Mexico is mixed. Some researchers ﬁnd
that PPP holds, others do not, and others argue that it holds but that structural shifts
in the relation have occurred. A recent approach to cointegration developed by
Enders, Im, and Lee is used to test for PPP between the United States and Mexico.
The EIL procedure uses stationary variables as instruments for nonstationary
covariates in the error correction and ADL models. When instruments are used the
test statistics are asymptotically normally distributed thus eliminating the nuisance
parameter problem and avoiding the need to bootstrap errors.
Initial estimation of the basic ECM and its ADL variant yields conﬂicting
evidence regarding PPP. All ECM speciﬁcations, instrumented or not, support the
PPP hypothesis; none of the ADL speciﬁcations with instruments do. Since other
researchers have found evidence of mean shifts in the Mexico–US exchange rate,
dummy variables for six exogenously imposed breaks are included in the empirical
models. Coefﬁcients on four of the six breaks are signiﬁcant in at least one variant

As a robustness check on the results, both the error correction and autoregressive distributed lag models
are also re-estimated replacing the four intercept break dummies with intercept and trend-shift dummies
at dates identiﬁed by the Lee–Strazicich unit root tests. Results are very similar to those shown in
dummies provide evidence of PPP, as do the ECM without dummies. Interestingly,
the ADL models with instruments and dummies also support PPP; all coefﬁcients on
the dollar-denominated Mexican price level are signiﬁcantly negative, unlike the
speciﬁcations without dummies. Overall the evidence indicates that PPP holds for
the 1933m03–2014m09 period between the US and Mexico, but that the purchasing
power parity relation between the two countries has changed over this time period.
