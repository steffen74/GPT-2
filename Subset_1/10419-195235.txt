
Growth of real gross domestic product (GDP) is generally considered to be
beneﬁcial for a country and a sign of a well-managed economy. GDP per capita is
also a widely used parameter to measure a country’s standard of living. Thus, an
analysis of the most relevant determinants of economic growth is useful. Earlier
studies have tried to determine the variables that impact economic growth, such as
labor productivity changes, changes in exports and changes in the capital stock.
Other studies have incorporated government policies to measure their effect on GDP
growth. This study adds to the literature by examining the impact of exports during
the commodity boom of the ﬁrst decade of the twenty ﬁrst century on the growth of
Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) countries.
The case of LAC countries has become more interesting since the Nineties when
many of their economies were liberalized (Dijkstra 2000) in terms of more favorable
rules for foreign direct investment, lower tariffs and non-tariff barriers to trade, and
regional trade agreements. In recent years, LAC countries have also had higher
average growth rates than in earlier years. In the period 2000–2010 the average
yearly real GDP per capita growth of LAC countries was 2.56 %, whereas during
the 1990–1999 decade the average yearly growth was only 2.07 %. For all the nonLAC countries in our study, the difference in average growth rate in the two
decades, 2.72 versus 2.19 %, was slightly greater. The increased growth rates that
took place during the commodity boom period are large, and therefore, it is
important to understand the origins and causes of this change.
Since the majority of LAC countries are important commodity exporters, the
question in this study is whether or not their increased growth is related to the
commodities boom of the 2000s. To answer this question we measure how much of
GDP per capita growth can be assigned to the boom using a panel data analysis
applied to LAC and non-LAC countries. The study includes neoclassical growth
model variables such as capital formation and growth of labor, export growth and,
following studies such as Sprout and Weaver (1993) and Arora and Vamvakidis
(2005a), trade partner growth. We then add variables for the commodity boom and
speciﬁc exports to see if they better explain growth. The conclusions that result from
this paper are important because they help to determine whether these above
average growth rates are sustainable in the longer term, and if they are important for
policy makers, government authorities and trade agreement negotiators, among
others, to take into consideration in their decisions. Since commodity booms are
often followed by commodity busts, as demonstrated by Spatafora and Tytell
(2009), it is important to estimate the relationship between the growth rates of LAC
economies and the commodity boom. By understanding this, it may be possible to
predict the impact of a commodity bust on future LAC growth rates.
The 2000s commodities boom is indicated by the IMF’s commodity price
indices. In Fig. 1, the trend in the prices of the principal commodities can be seen
for the period 1990–2010. The Metals Price Index rose 275 % in the boom period
(2000–2010), while the average of the three Crude Oil Price Indices increased

examine why economies grow and the critical variables in this process. Section 3

their characteristics. Section 4 presents the results of the models. Concluding
remarks are presented in the ﬁnal section.

2 Literature review
The study of economic growth has attracted the attention of economists since the
beginning of economic science. Since it is hard to isolate speciﬁc causes due to the
dynamic nature of economies, many explanations for the phenomenon of growth
have arisen; some of them have been proven to be empirically correct and others
have had contradictory results. This section reviews export led growth (ELG)
studies based on aggregate exports and then reviews studies based on speciﬁc types
of exports, particularly commodities, and studies speciﬁc to LAC countries.
Export led growth (ELG) models explain economic growth as resulting from
exports due to many factors such as economies of scale due to larger markets,
concentration in industries where a country has a comparative advantage,
technological improvements, the transmission of better management techniques,
and more opportunities for entrepreneurial activities (Feder 1982; Giles and
Williams 2000a; Kali et al. 2007; Dreger and Herzer 2013). An early ELG model is
that of Feder (1982). In his empirical analysis, he estimated neoclassical models
of the growth than the neoclassical models. Although Feder did not include it in his
models, other authors (e.g., Barro 1991; Sachs and Warner 1995; Greenaway et al.
1999) estimating GDP growth have argued that countries with lower initial levels of
income per capita tend to growth faster in the short run, thus tending to converge to
the GDP per capita levels of higher income countries.
Some more recent ELG studies have expanded on the role of exports in
explaining growth of GDP. For example, Sprout and Weaver (1993) hypothesized
that a country’s export growth depended in part on the economic growth of its main
trading partners. Arora and Vamvakidis (2005a) found that a 1 % increase in a
country’s trade partners was correlated with as much as a 0.8 % increase in its own
growth. Other studies that have looked at some measure of trade partners’ effect on
a country’s growth include Arora and Vamvakidis (2005b), Kali et al. (2007), Beny
and Cook (2009), Fagiolo et al. (2010) and Dabla-Norris et al. (2015).
Hundreds of studies have now been conducted testing various versions of the
ELG model with mixed results. Several studies have tried to evaluate the overall
ﬁndings of ELG research. Giles and Williams (2000a, b) surveyed 150 ELG papers
and were generally negative about the robustness of the studies. Two more recent
studies have used meta-analysis to evaluate ELG studies and have more positive
ﬁndings. Mookerjee (2006) examined 76 ELG studies; he found overall that exports
were signiﬁcantly correlated with growth. Sannassee et al. (2014) used metaanalysis on 82 ELG studies. Most of these studies showed that exports led to an
increase in growth. They concluded that use of a production function approach with
labor, capital and exports was the most appropriate model.
In addition to ELG studies that examine the effect of some measure of aggregate
exports on exports, there are studies that have looked at the effect on growth of speciﬁc
types of exports, particularly commodities. Mookerjee’s (2006) meta-analysis
examined not only aggregate exports but manufactured and oil exports, and found
that use of these measures of exports tended to strengthen the relationship with GDP
growth. Since we were not able to ﬁnd surveys of these studies other than Mookerjee,
we cite a few examples. Greenaway et al. (1999) estimated growth for all exports and
then for different categories of exports; they found exports of fuels, metals and textiles
had more effect on growth than food or other primary products. Al-Marhubi (2000)
found that share of manufactured goods and more diverse exports increased growth.
Beny and Cook (2009) looked at agricultural, ore and minerals, and petroleum exports
(as a percentage of GDP) with an interaction effect for African countries. They found
that agricultural exports, and to a lesser extent, ore and minerals had a positive effect
on growth in Africa. Spatafora and Tytell (2009) looked at the effect of countryspeciﬁc commodity price cycles on more than 150 countries beginning in the early
1970s and found that median annual growth was nearly two percentage points higher
during commodity price booms than busts. Collier and Goderis (2012) found an
increase in commodity prices tended to have a short-run positive effect on growth, but
the long-run effect was often negative, particularly for non-agricultural commodities
and when the country was subject to bad governance. (Cavalcanti et al. 2015)
examined the relationship between economic growth and an index of commodity
effect on the primary product exporters. Addison et al. (2016) found that agricultural
price shocks were positively correlated with growth in Sub-Saharan Africa.
A few recent studies have looked at Latin American growth and commodity
prices. Siliverstovs and Herzer (2006) found that Chile’s manufactured products had
a positive impact on growth, whereas its primary exports did not. Camacho and
Perez-Quiros (2014) related output growth to commodity price shocks in seven LAC
countries and found that commodity price shocks were pro-cyclical. Gruss (2014)
looked at the effect of the commodity boom on LAC countries and concluded there
was a positive relationship between the growth in commodity prices and output
growth in these countries; however, there was not a relationship between the level of
prices and output growth.

3 Hypothesis, data and methodology
Given the good performance of LAC economies during the ﬁrst decade of the twenty ﬁrst
century and the fact that many of these countries have export-oriented economies based
on commodities, this study examines the effects of commodity exports on countries’ per
capita economic growth rates from 1990 to 2010 and during the commodity boom from
2000 to 2010 using a panel data analysis. First, we apply a chow breakpoint test to the
three commodity price series shown in Fig. 1 to conﬁrm 2000–2010 as the boom period.
The results, shown in ‘‘Appendix’’, reject the null hypothesis for the three series,
supporting the deﬁnition of the boom period as 2000–2010.
Next, we develop three estimation models centered on the literature review. The
models are based on the relationship between the economic growth and measures of
export composition, following Al-Marhubi (2000). The ﬁrst model contains only the
classical variables of the ELG model and trade partner growth. The second model
includes interaction variables for the boom period and for the LAC countries during
the boom. Third, we estimate ﬁve equations where we include individually each of
the four commodity exports and manufactured exports, with interactions for the
boom and the boom in LAC countries. The base model is shown in Eq. 1 and is
similar to Al-Marhubi (2000).

where yit is the GDP per capita growth for country i in year t, xkit is the control
variables k for country i in year t and zjit is the j export variables. The control
variables are the initial level of GDP per capita in each country (Yi0); labor (lit) and
capital (kit) (following the neoclassical growth model); and aggregate exports (axit)
around a time trend, as in DeJong and Whiteman (1991), Dreger and Herzer (2013),
and Leybourne (1995). Thus, in this model, the effect of labor is incorporated as a
constant b1 . Then the model can be written as Eq. 2.

where b0 is a negative parameter and the other b’s are positive parameters.
As exports may have an endogeneity problem with the dependent variable, the
lead and lag differences of export growth are added to the equation, so their
coefﬁcients ck account for serial correlation and endogeneity (Herzer and Vollmer
2012).
Our second model includes the impact of the boom period on all countries in our
study and on the LAC countries, and is shown in Eq. 3.

BoomDt is a dummy variable that takes on a value of 1 from 2000 to 2010 and 0 at
any other time; and LacDi Á BoomDt is a dummy variable that takes on a value of 1
only for LAC countries during the commodity boom period (2000–2010) and a
value of 0 for non-LAC countries. The interaction terms ðb7 kit þ b8 axit þ b9 tpit Þ Á
BoomDt and ðb10 kit þ b11 axit þ b12 tpit Þ Á LacDi Á BoomDt are included to assess the
channel through which the export boom affected growth for the entire group of
countries, as well as for LAC countries.
In our third set of models, where we test for the effect of speciﬁc types of exports
on growth, we run separate analyses for four commodity groups (agricultural raw
materials exports, ore and minerals exports, food exports, and fuel exports) and for
manufactured exports, all measured as a percentage of merchandise exports for each
country. This disaggregation is taken from the classiﬁcation by the World Bank in
the WDI database. In these analyses, we include BoomDt and LacDi Á BoomDt
variables as well as three new variables to include the impact of each speciﬁc export
type for each country on the GDP per capita growth. CommDij is a variable where j
stands for agriculture exports, food exports, fuel exports, ore and mineral exports or
manufactured exports. CommDji Á BoomDt represents exports of each export
category j during the boom period for each country, while LacDi Á CommDji Á
Boomt represents exports of each export category during the boom period only for

Most of the data were obtained from the World Bank’s World Development
Indicators (WDI) (World Bank 2012) for the period 1990–2010 for 97 countries, 14
of which are LAC countries. The WDI variables for each country are real GDP per
capita growth (annual %); real GDP per capita in 1990; gross capital formation
(annual % growth); exports of goods and services (annual % growth); and
agricultural raw materials exports, food exports, fuel exports, ore and mineral
exports and manufactured exports (each as % of merchandise exports). Exports by
trade partners are from the IMF’s direction of trade statistics (DoTS). Exports by
trade partners were used to compute the weighted trade partner growth as described
in Beny and Cook (2009). From the matrix of exports by trade partner a weighted
matrix was obtained, which was multiplied by the GDP growth of each trade
partner, giving a matrix of weighted partner growth for each country in each time
period.
From the descriptive statistics shown in Table 1, it can be observed that during
the entire period the yearly average GDP per capita growth of all the countries under
study was 2.45 %, and a clear difference existed between the period 1990–1999 and
the period related to the commodities boom (2000–2010) for both LAC and nonLAC countries. In the case of non-LAC countries, their growth rate increased from

Annual growth of capital formation for LAC countries was 8.13 % during
1990–199 but fell to 6.01 % during 2000–2010; capital formation was 4.91 % for
non-LAC countries during 1990–1999 and rose to 5.59 % during 2000–2010. For
non-LAC countries in the period 1990–1999 export trade partners’ average growth
was 2.74 %, while for the LAC countries it was 2.09 %, but during the period
2000–2010 the trade partners’ growth increased more for LAC countries than nonLAC countries, reaching a slightly higher rate; LAC countries’ trade partners had an
average growth of 8.88 % and non-LAC countries, 8.51 %. The annual growth of
exports decreased on average in the boom period for all countries in study, but LAC
countries experienced a decline of 2.61 % points while non-LAC countries
experienced a decline of only 0.86 % points. The sums of the merchandise export
shares shown in Table 1 do not sum to 100 % because of unclassiﬁed trade.

4 Results and discussion
All the models are estimated through dynamic ordinary least squares (DOLS) using
the white cross-sectional standard error and covariance method, to eliminate the
endogeneity (Herzer and Vollmer 2012) and to obtain comparable results between
models with and without dummy variables (Wooldridge 2002). The results of model
1 (Eq. 2), the ELG model (see Table 2) show that capital formation, export growth,
and trade partner growth had a positive and statistically signiﬁcant effect on GDP
per capita growth, with estimators of 0.118, 0.192, and 0.040 % points, respectively.
The coefﬁcient for the 1990 level of GDP per capita is positive in contrast to the
predicted negative value but is not statistically signiﬁcant.
The analysis of model 2 (Eq. 3) shows that capital formation and export growth
are consistent with the results in model 1, but trade partner growth loses its
statistical signiﬁcance; instead the interaction between trade partner growth and
‘‘Boom’’ has a signiﬁcant coefﬁcient of 0.069, indicating that this effect is
concentrated during the commodity boom period. In the case of LAC countries and
for all countries during the commodity boom period, there is no additional statistical
signiﬁcance for ELG variables. In model 2, the 1990 level of GDP per capita shows
a positive effect with weak statistical signiﬁcance; thus the assumption of faster
growth for countries with lower initial levels of GDP per capita is not supported.
Summarizing the results above, capital formation and export growth appear to
have a positive effect on growth over the entire time period while trade partner
growth arises as a globally important factor during the boom period.
In Table 3, we study the commodity boom effects on GDP per capita growth in
LAC versus non-LAC countries for speciﬁc export groups (Eq. 4); the variables for
the export groups are the four commodity groups (agricultural raw materials
exports, ore and mineral exports, food exports, and fuel exports), each as a
percentage of total merchandise exports. Also, we include manufactured exports for

For the ﬁve equations in Table 3, capital formation and export growth continue to
show positive effects on economic growth, supporting ELG hypothesis. During
boom period, export growth and trade partner growth show additional positive
effects on economic growth, which supports the ELG hypothesis and suggests that
during this period, commercial interactions between countries lead to synergic
effects. No additional statistically signiﬁcant effects for the ELG variables are found
during boom period for LAC countries.
Model ‘‘Ore’’ shows that ore and mineral exports, in general, had a negative
effect on GDP per capita growth for all countries over the entire period. But ore and
mineral exports had a positive impact of 0.027 % points for LAC countries during
the boom period. In the case of agricultural raw material products, the effect is
negative for all countries during the boom period (-0.028) and is even more
negative for LAC countries during the boom period (-0.143). Fuel exports have a
negative effect on the GDP per capita growth, but a slightly positive effect during
breakdown of commodity exports

the entire period of the study, and a greater negative effect during the boom period.
Manufactured exports generally had a positive impact on the GDP per capita growth
(0.022), but the coefﬁcient for their effect on LAC countries during the boom period
is negative, indicating manufactured exports of LAC countries had very little
positive effect on growth during the commodity boom.
The above analysis looks at the aggregate effects of various export groups on
LAC countries during the boom. It shows that only ore and mineral exports
increased the growth of LAC countries during the boom period. If we look at
individual LAC countries having large ore and mineral exports or large fuel exports,
we see that the contribution of these commodity exports to growth was substantial
during the boom. According to our results, during the 2000–2010 boom period, the
share of ores and minerals in exports explained 14.1 % of GDP per capita growth
for Chile, 9.4 % for Bolivia, and 8.4 % for Peru. The share of fuel exports explained
49.8 % of GDP per capita growth for Venezuela, 21.2 % for Bolivia, 17.6 % for
Colombia, 12.8 % for Argentina, and 14.2 % for Mexico.

5 Concluding remarks
The results show that, in general, during the period of 2000–2010 corresponding to
commodity boom GDP per capita growth was 24 % higher than in 1990–1999 on
average for the non-LAC countries and also 24 % higher for the LAC countries. Our
ﬁrst model, which looks at all countries over the entire period, supports the ELG
theory. Growth of GDP per capita is a function of capital formation, export growth
and trade partner growth. Our second model is similar except that trade partner
growth is signiﬁcant only during the boom period. The third set of models has
similar results supporting the ELG theory, but indicates that the type of exports can
have effects on growth that vary between the boom and non-boom period, and
between LAC and non-LAC countries. To summarize, ore and mineral exports
and then especially on LAC countries. Fuel exports have a negative effect in the
non-boom period but not during the boom. Food exports have a negative effect on
growth during the entire period, and slightly more negative during the boom period.
On the other hand, manufactured exports generally have a positive effect on growth
over the period examined, except for LAC countries during the boom. When we
look at individual LAC countries, we can see that growth of major ore and mineral
exporters and major fuel exporters was signiﬁcantly impacted by the commodity
boom. Therefore, we can expect that the end of the commodity boom took its toll on
these LAC countries.

Abstract Commodity prices are characterized by boom and bust cycles. In this
article, the impact of the commodity boom of the 2000s on Latin American and
Caribbean economies is studied by analyzing four categories of commodity exports
(agricultural raw materials, fuel, food, ore and minerals) as well as manufactured
exports. Latin American and Caribbean economies had higher growth during the
2000s than in the period before the commodities boom. This study examines
whether the higher growth was explained by the commodity boom, and if so, which
of the different export commodities accounted for this higher growth. The ﬁndings
should be relevant to understanding the effects on economic growth of a possible
bust in commodity prices. The results show that ore and mineral exports, fuel
exports and food exports generally had a negative effect on GDP per capita growth
but ore and mineral exports had a positive effect on LAC countries during the boom.
During the boom period, agricultural exports had negative effects, especially for
LAC countries. Fuel exports had a positive effect on LAC and non-LAC countries
during the boom. Manufacturing exports in general had a positive effect on economic growth, but in the boom period this effect almost disappeared for the LAC
countries.

Growth of real gross domestic product (GDP) is generally considered to be
beneﬁcial for a country and a sign of a well-managed economy. GDP per capita is
also a widely used parameter to measure a country’s standard of living. Thus, an
analysis of the most relevant determinants of economic growth is useful. Earlier
studies have tried to determine the variables that impact economic growth, such as
labor productivity changes, changes in exports and changes in the capital stock.
Other studies have incorporated government policies to measure their effect on GDP
growth. This study adds to the literature by examining the impact of exports during
the commodity boom of the ﬁrst decade of the twenty ﬁrst century on the growth of
Latin American and Caribbean (LAC) countries.
The case of LAC countries has become more interesting since the Nineties when
many of their economies were liberalized (Dijkstra 2000) in terms of more favorable
rules for foreign direct investment, lower tariffs and non-tariff barriers to trade, and
regional trade agreements. In recent years, LAC countries have also had higher
average growth rates than in earlier years. In the period 2000–2010 the average
yearly real GDP per capita growth of LAC countries was 2.56 %, whereas during
the 1990–1999 decade the average yearly growth was only 2.07 %. For all the nonLAC countries in our study, the difference in average growth rate in the two
decades, 2.72 versus 2.19 %, was slightly greater. The increased growth rates that
took place during the commodity boom period are large, and therefore, it is
important to understand the origins and causes of this change.
Since the majority of LAC countries are important commodity exporters, the
question in this study is whether or not their increased growth is related to the
commodities boom of the 2000s. To answer this question we measure how much of
GDP per capita growth can be assigned to the boom using a panel data analysis
applied to LAC and non-LAC countries. The study includes neoclassical growth
model variables such as capital formation and growth of labor, export growth and,
following studies such as Sprout and Weaver (1993) and Arora and Vamvakidis
(2005a), trade partner growth. We then add variables for the commodity boom and
speciﬁc exports to see if they better explain growth. The conclusions that result from
this paper are important because they help to determine whether these above
average growth rates are sustainable in the longer term, and if they are important for
policy makers, government authorities and trade agreement negotiators, among
others, to take into consideration in their decisions. Since commodity booms are
often followed by commodity busts, as demonstrated by Spatafora and Tytell
(2009), it is important to estimate the relationship between the growth rates of LAC
economies and the commodity boom. By understanding this, it may be possible to
predict the impact of a commodity bust on future LAC growth rates.
The 2000s commodities boom is indicated by the IMF’s commodity price
indices. In Fig. 1, the trend in the prices of the principal commodities can be seen
for the period 1990–2010. The Metals Price Index rose 275 % in the boom period
(2000–2010), while the average of the three Crude Oil Price Indices increased

2 Literature review
The study of economic growth has attracted the attention of economists since the
beginning of economic science. Since it is hard to isolate speciﬁc causes due to the
dynamic nature of economies, many explanations for the phenomenon of growth
have arisen; some of them have been proven to be empirically correct and others
have had contradictory results. This section reviews export led growth (ELG)
studies based on aggregate exports and then reviews studies based on speciﬁc types
of exports, particularly commodities, and studies speciﬁc to LAC countries.
Export led growth (ELG) models explain economic growth as resulting from
exports due to many factors such as economies of scale due to larger markets,
concentration in industries where a country has a comparative advantage,
technological improvements, the transmission of better management techniques,
and more opportunities for entrepreneurial activities (Feder 1982; Giles and
Williams 2000a; Kali et al. 2007; Dreger and Herzer 2013). An early ELG model is
that of Feder (1982). In his empirical analysis, he estimated neoclassical models
of the growth than the neoclassical models. Although Feder did not include it in his
models, other authors (e.g., Barro 1991; Sachs and Warner 1995; Greenaway et al.
1999) estimating GDP growth have argued that countries with lower initial levels of
income per capita tend to growth faster in the short run, thus tending to converge to
the GDP per capita levels of higher income countries.
Some more recent ELG studies have expanded on the role of exports in
explaining growth of GDP. For example, Sprout and Weaver (1993) hypothesized
that a country’s export growth depended in part on the economic growth of its main
trading partners. Arora and Vamvakidis (2005a) found that a 1 % increase in a
country’s trade partners was correlated with as much as a 0.8 % increase in its own
growth. Other studies that have looked at some measure of trade partners’ effect on
a country’s growth include Arora and Vamvakidis (2005b), Kali et al. (2007), Beny
and Cook (2009), Fagiolo et al. (2010) and Dabla-Norris et al. (2015).
Hundreds of studies have now been conducted testing various versions of the
ELG model with mixed results. Several studies have tried to evaluate the overall
ﬁndings of ELG research. Giles and Williams (2000a, b) surveyed 150 ELG papers
and were generally negative about the robustness of the studies. Two more recent
studies have used meta-analysis to evaluate ELG studies and have more positive
ﬁndings. Mookerjee (2006) examined 76 ELG studies; he found overall that exports
were signiﬁcantly correlated with growth. Sannassee et al. (2014) used metaanalysis on 82 ELG studies. Most of these studies showed that exports led to an
increase in growth. They concluded that use of a production function approach with
labor, capital and exports was the most appropriate model.
In addition to ELG studies that examine the effect of some measure of aggregate
exports on exports, there are studies that have looked at the effect on growth of speciﬁc
types of exports, particularly commodities. Mookerjee’s (2006) meta-analysis
examined not only aggregate exports but manufactured and oil exports, and found
that use of these measures of exports tended to strengthen the relationship with GDP
growth. Since we were not able to ﬁnd surveys of these studies other than Mookerjee,
we cite a few examples. Greenaway et al. (1999) estimated growth for all exports and
then for different categories of exports; they found exports of fuels, metals and textiles
had more effect on growth than food or other primary products. Al-Marhubi (2000)
found that share of manufactured goods and more diverse exports increased growth.
Beny and Cook (2009) looked at agricultural, ore and minerals, and petroleum exports
(as a percentage of GDP) with an interaction effect for African countries. They found
that agricultural exports, and to a lesser extent, ore and minerals had a positive effect
on growth in Africa. Spatafora and Tytell (2009) looked at the effect of countryspeciﬁc commodity price cycles on more than 150 countries beginning in the early
1970s and found that median annual growth was nearly two percentage points higher
during commodity price booms than busts. Collier and Goderis (2012) found an
increase in commodity prices tended to have a short-run positive effect on growth, but
the long-run effect was often negative, particularly for non-agricultural commodities
and when the country was subject to bad governance. (Cavalcanti et al. 2015)
examined the relationship between economic growth and an index of commodity
effect on the primary product exporters. Addison et al. (2016) found that agricultural
price shocks were positively correlated with growth in Sub-Saharan Africa.
A few recent studies have looked at Latin American growth and commodity
prices. Siliverstovs and Herzer (2006) found that Chile’s manufactured products had
a positive impact on growth, whereas its primary exports did not. Camacho and
Perez-Quiros (2014) related output growth to commodity price shocks in seven LAC
countries and found that commodity price shocks were pro-cyclical. Gruss (2014)
looked at the effect of the commodity boom on LAC countries and concluded there
was a positive relationship between the growth in commodity prices and output
growth in these countries; however, there was not a relationship between the level of
prices and output growth.

3 Hypothesis, data and methodology
Given the good performance of LAC economies during the ﬁrst decade of the twenty ﬁrst
century and the fact that many of these countries have export-oriented economies based
on commodities, this study examines the effects of commodity exports on countries’ per
capita economic growth rates from 1990 to 2010 and during the commodity boom from
2000 to 2010 using a panel data analysis. First, we apply a chow breakpoint test to the
three commodity price series shown in Fig. 1 to conﬁrm 2000–2010 as the boom period.
The results, shown in ‘‘Appendix’’, reject the null hypothesis for the three series,
supporting the deﬁnition of the boom period as 2000–2010.
Next, we develop three estimation models centered on the literature review. The
models are based on the relationship between the economic growth and measures of
export composition, following Al-Marhubi (2000). The ﬁrst model contains only the
classical variables of the ELG model and trade partner growth. The second model
includes interaction variables for the boom period and for the LAC countries during
the boom. Third, we estimate ﬁve equations where we include individually each of
the four commodity exports and manufactured exports, with interactions for the
boom and the boom in LAC countries. The base model is shown in Eq. 1 and is
similar to Al-Marhubi (2000).

where yit is the GDP per capita growth for country i in year t, xkit is the control
variables k for country i in year t and zjit is the j export variables. The control
variables are the initial level of GDP per capita in each country (Yi0); labor (lit) and
capital (kit) (following the neoclassical growth model); and aggregate exports (axit)
around a time trend, as in DeJong and Whiteman (1991), Dreger and Herzer (2013),
and Leybourne (1995). Thus, in this model, the effect of labor is incorporated as a
constant b1 . Then the model can be written as Eq. 2.

where b0 is a negative parameter and the other b’s are positive parameters.
As exports may have an endogeneity problem with the dependent variable, the
lead and lag differences of export growth are added to the equation, so their
coefﬁcients ck account for serial correlation and endogeneity (Herzer and Vollmer
2012).
Our second model includes the impact of the boom period on all countries in our
study and on the LAC countries, and is shown in Eq. 3.

BoomDt is a dummy variable that takes on a value of 1 from 2000 to 2010 and 0 at
any other time; and LacDi Á BoomDt is a dummy variable that takes on a value of 1
only for LAC countries during the commodity boom period (2000–2010) and a
value of 0 for non-LAC countries. The interaction terms ðb7 kit þ b8 axit þ b9 tpit Þ Á
BoomDt and ðb10 kit þ b11 axit þ b12 tpit Þ Á LacDi Á BoomDt are included to assess the
channel through which the export boom affected growth for the entire group of
countries, as well as for LAC countries.
In our third set of models, where we test for the effect of speciﬁc types of exports
on growth, we run separate analyses for four commodity groups (agricultural raw
materials exports, ore and minerals exports, food exports, and fuel exports) and for
manufactured exports, all measured as a percentage of merchandise exports for each
country. This disaggregation is taken from the classiﬁcation by the World Bank in
the WDI database. In these analyses, we include BoomDt and LacDi Á BoomDt
variables as well as three new variables to include the impact of each speciﬁc export
type for each country on the GDP per capita growth. CommDij is a variable where j
stands for agriculture exports, food exports, fuel exports, ore and mineral exports or
manufactured exports. CommDji Á BoomDt represents exports of each export
category j during the boom period for each country, while LacDi Á CommDji Á
Boomt represents exports of each export category during the boom period only for

Most of the data were obtained from the World Bank’s World Development
Indicators (WDI) (World Bank 2012) for the period 1990–2010 for 97 countries, 14
of which are LAC countries. The WDI variables for each country are real GDP per
capita growth (annual %); real GDP per capita in 1990; gross capital formation
(annual % growth); exports of goods and services (annual % growth); and
agricultural raw materials exports, food exports, fuel exports, ore and mineral
exports and manufactured exports (each as % of merchandise exports). Exports by
trade partners are from the IMF’s direction of trade statistics (DoTS). Exports by
trade partners were used to compute the weighted trade partner growth as described
in Beny and Cook (2009). From the matrix of exports by trade partner a weighted
matrix was obtained, which was multiplied by the GDP growth of each trade
partner, giving a matrix of weighted partner growth for each country in each time
period.
From the descriptive statistics shown in Table 1, it can be observed that during
the entire period the yearly average GDP per capita growth of all the countries under
study was 2.45 %, and a clear difference existed between the period 1990–1999 and
the period related to the commodities boom (2000–2010) for both LAC and nonLAC countries. In the case of non-LAC countries, their growth rate increased from

Annual growth of capital formation for LAC countries was 8.13 % during
1990–199 but fell to 6.01 % during 2000–2010; capital formation was 4.91 % for
non-LAC countries during 1990–1999 and rose to 5.59 % during 2000–2010. For
non-LAC countries in the period 1990–1999 export trade partners’ average growth
was 2.74 %, while for the LAC countries it was 2.09 %, but during the period
2000–2010 the trade partners’ growth increased more for LAC countries than nonLAC countries, reaching a slightly higher rate; LAC countries’ trade partners had an
average growth of 8.88 % and non-LAC countries, 8.51 %. The annual growth of
exports decreased on average in the boom period for all countries in study, but LAC
countries experienced a decline of 2.61 % points while non-LAC countries
experienced a decline of only 0.86 % points. The sums of the merchandise export
shares shown in Table 1 do not sum to 100 % because of unclassiﬁed trade.

4 Results and discussion
All the models are estimated through dynamic ordinary least squares (DOLS) using
the white cross-sectional standard error and covariance method, to eliminate the
endogeneity (Herzer and Vollmer 2012) and to obtain comparable results between
models with and without dummy variables (Wooldridge 2002). The results of model
1 (Eq. 2), the ELG model (see Table 2) show that capital formation, export growth,
and trade partner growth had a positive and statistically signiﬁcant effect on GDP
per capita growth, with estimators of 0.118, 0.192, and 0.040 % points, respectively.
The coefﬁcient for the 1990 level of GDP per capita is positive in contrast to the
predicted negative value but is not statistically signiﬁcant.
The analysis of model 2 (Eq. 3) shows that capital formation and export growth
are consistent with the results in model 1, but trade partner growth loses its
statistical signiﬁcance; instead the interaction between trade partner growth and
‘‘Boom’’ has a signiﬁcant coefﬁcient of 0.069, indicating that this effect is
concentrated during the commodity boom period. In the case of LAC countries and
for all countries during the commodity boom period, there is no additional statistical
signiﬁcance for ELG variables. In model 2, the 1990 level of GDP per capita shows
a positive effect with weak statistical signiﬁcance; thus the assumption of faster
growth for countries with lower initial levels of GDP per capita is not supported.
Summarizing the results above, capital formation and export growth appear to
have a positive effect on growth over the entire time period while trade partner
growth arises as a globally important factor during the boom period.
In Table 3, we study the commodity boom effects on GDP per capita growth in
LAC versus non-LAC countries for speciﬁc export groups (Eq. 4); the variables for
the export groups are the four commodity groups (agricultural raw materials
exports, ore and mineral exports, food exports, and fuel exports), each as a
percentage of total merchandise exports. Also, we include manufactured exports for

For the ﬁve equations in Table 3, capital formation and export growth continue to
show positive effects on economic growth, supporting ELG hypothesis. During
boom period, export growth and trade partner growth show additional positive
effects on economic growth, which supports the ELG hypothesis and suggests that
during this period, commercial interactions between countries lead to synergic
effects. No additional statistically signiﬁcant effects for the ELG variables are found
during boom period for LAC countries.
Model ‘‘Ore’’ shows that ore and mineral exports, in general, had a negative
effect on GDP per capita growth for all countries over the entire period. But ore and
mineral exports had a positive impact of 0.027 % points for LAC countries during
the boom period. In the case of agricultural raw material products, the effect is
negative for all countries during the boom period (-0.028) and is even more
negative for LAC countries during the boom period (-0.143). Fuel exports have a
negative effect on the GDP per capita growth, but a slightly positive effect during
breakdown of commodity exports

the entire period of the study, and a greater negative effect during the boom period.
Manufactured exports generally had a positive impact on the GDP per capita growth
(0.022), but the coefﬁcient for their effect on LAC countries during the boom period
is negative, indicating manufactured exports of LAC countries had very little
positive effect on growth during the commodity boom.
The above analysis looks at the aggregate effects of various export groups on
LAC countries during the boom. It shows that only ore and mineral exports
increased the growth of LAC countries during the boom period. If we look at
individual LAC countries having large ore and mineral exports or large fuel exports,
we see that the contribution of these commodity exports to growth was substantial
during the boom. According to our results, during the 2000–2010 boom period, the
share of ores and minerals in exports explained 14.1 % of GDP per capita growth
for Chile, 9.4 % for Bolivia, and 8.4 % for Peru. The share of fuel exports explained
49.8 % of GDP per capita growth for Venezuela, 21.2 % for Bolivia, 17.6 % for
Colombia, 12.8 % for Argentina, and 14.2 % for Mexico.

5 Concluding remarks
The results show that, in general, during the period of 2000–2010 corresponding to
commodity boom GDP per capita growth was 24 % higher than in 1990–1999 on
average for the non-LAC countries and also 24 % higher for the LAC countries. Our
ﬁrst model, which looks at all countries over the entire period, supports the ELG
theory. Growth of GDP per capita is a function of capital formation, export growth
and trade partner growth. Our second model is similar except that trade partner
growth is signiﬁcant only during the boom period. The third set of models has
similar results supporting the ELG theory, but indicates that the type of exports can
have effects on growth that vary between the boom and non-boom period, and
between LAC and non-LAC countries. To summarize, ore and mineral exports
and then especially on LAC countries. Fuel exports have a negative effect in the
non-boom period but not during the boom. Food exports have a negative effect on
growth during the entire period, and slightly more negative during the boom period.
On the other hand, manufactured exports generally have a positive effect on growth
over the period examined, except for LAC countries during the boom. When we
look at individual LAC countries, we can see that growth of major ore and mineral
exporters and major fuel exporters was signiﬁcantly impacted by the commodity
boom. Therefore, we can expect that the end of the commodity boom took its toll on
these LAC countries.
