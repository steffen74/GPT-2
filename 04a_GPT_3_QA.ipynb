            "[answer 1] : The economic effects of climate change will depend on how the economy is organised.\n",
            "[answer 2] : The economic effect of climate change is likely to be a sharp increase in the costs of living, including higher energy bills and rising food prices. The impact on global agricultural production may also be significant.\n",
            "[answer 3] : The effects of climate change will be devastating, especially in the developing world.\n",
            "[answer 4] : Economic effects of global warming include:\n",

            "[answer 2] : The amount of wildlife tourism that is affected by global warming varies from place to place.\n",
            "[answer 3] : No impact on wildlife tourism.\n",
            "[answer 4] : It affects wildlife tourism, but not as much as climate change. In fact, the number of animals living in the wild is actually increasing due to changes caused by global warming.\n",
            "[answer 5] : Global warming is not only affecting tourism, but wildlife populations such as elephants and seabirds.\n",

            "[question 4] : What is the impact from sea level rise on tourism?\n",
            "[answer 1] : Sea level rise is the amount of sea water that falls onto land as a result of global warming. This will have an impact on tourism, especially around major cities like London and New York City.\n",
            "[answer 2] : Sea level rise is caused by sea level rise, but it also has an impact on tourism.\n",
            "[answer 3] : Sea level rise is impacting tourism, but not as much as many people think.\n",
            "[answer 4] : Sea level rise, as measured by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), will affect tourism in the United States because of rising sea levels.\n",
            "[answer 5] : Sea level rise is a large-scale change in the earth's climate, but there are many ways that tourists can benefit from changes to their environment.\n",

            "[answer 2] : Green economy is the emerging generation of businesses that are trying to do good for the planet.\n",
            "[answer 3] : Green economy is the movement of goods and services from a producer to consumers in an effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n",
            "[answer 4] : Green economy refers to the way in which we use energy, transport and other resources to create a living environment that is more renewable with less dependence on fossil fuels.\n",
            "[answer 5] : The green economy is a phenomenon that allows for increased production of energy, resulting in less greenhouse gas emissions. This requires a shift from fossil fuel to renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar power generation.\n",
