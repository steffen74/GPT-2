[QUESTION]:What is the difference between climate change and global warming? 
[ANSWER]:Global warming refers to the long-term warming of the planet. Climate change encompasses global warming, but refers to the broader range of changes that are happening to our planet, including rising sea levels; shrinking mountain glaciers; accelerating ice melt in Greenland, Antarctica and the Arctic; and shifts in flower/plant blooming times.

[QUESTION]:What is the greenhouse effect? 
[ANSWER]:The greenhouse effect is the way in which heat is trapped close to the surface of the Earth by greenhouse gases.

[QUESTION]:How much does nuclear power affect world climate change? 
[ANSWER]:It impacts on climate change by increasing the amount of heat that can survive inside the neutron star. Nuclear reactors require large amounts of raw materials, but store heat in great quantities of electricity, so more heat usually comes to the surface of the Earth
than goes into the reactor – the melted neutron star core. For heat to be stored at the surface of the Earth, heat needs to go through cooling, removing evaporative restraints and the release of heat through pressurisation. Nuclear plants typically operate in their

[QUESTION]:How much does nuclear power affect world climate change? 
[ANSWER]:About 350 terawatts of electricity? Mostly? In America? Probably? Canada? Probably?
Canada's ENCINO Network visualizes trendlines. Specifically, N ecino shows climate warming over the last century and the trends since then. But it has two core features :
(a) all data shows a trend of increasing warming, and (b) trendlines with positive years show a trend of decreasing warming.
For the rest, I defer to Andrew Stanton:

====================


[QUESTION]:How much does nuclear power affect world climate change? 
[ANSWER]:Global warming refers to the long-term warming of the planet. Interstellar currents also use nuclear energy, which also requires a lot of energy to turn. Nuclear energy is eco-friendly, but it causes pollution because of nuclear waste. Nuclear power plants also have a very high health risk because of waste.

====================


[QUESTION]:How much does nuclear power affect world climate change? 
[ANSWER]:Same question.

====================


[QUESTION]:How much does nuclear power affect world climate change? 
[ANSWER]:A nuclear power plant creates waste heat which travels up to the ground or sea level. Gas is emitted. This decomposed heat travels down into the ground or sea which releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.

====================


[QUESTION]:How much does nuclear power affect world climate change? 
[ANSWER]: Nuclear power, known as the Holy Grail to environmental activists is one of the places where new and shiny ideas plummet to the dreamless dream of a fossil gas industry.
In 1993, the Accords were adopted and Nansenʼs 1988 work was president of the Action Committee for Energy and Environment (Reevers Hedgersdorf, Kostanica), the main organization led by Hedgersdorf that opposed nuclear.
By 1997, nuclear power was declining. In 1998, around
====================


[QUESTION]:How much does nuclear power affect world climate change? 
[ANSWER]:Nuclear means breaking up atoms of water rather than damaging them. Plants also need sunlight to grow, and the curable substances in the atmosphere made by burning fossil fuels, including carbon dioxide, can be used up in a day.

====================


[QUESTION]:How much does nuclear power affect world climate change? 
[ANSWER]:Nuclear power well, nuclear power generated, nuclear power produced.

====================


[QUESTION]:How much does nuclear power affect world climate change? 
[ANSWER]:As heavily as possible: nuclear power has a positive impact on the climate, because some climate effects, such as global warming, are associated with radiating heat. Radiated heat, like heat that is stored in the atmosphere, radiates heat, like heat, that is stored in the atmosphere, effectively proceeding from the ground up.

[QUESTION]:What will be th economic effects of climate Change? 
[ANSWER]:The economic changes attributed to climate change can be expected to result in prolongation of cooling likely across the planet. What species will be impacted will depend strongly on which animal species or plant/cluster/organ, whether natural or anthropogenic, is considered a ground or a trace carbon footprint.

====================


[QUESTION]:What will be th economic effects of climate Change? 
[ANSWER]:Climate change will affect our economy by leading us into difficult socio-economic choices. Producers will become more efficient; farmers will be able to more quickly and easily distribute their goods to consumers; towns will suffer damage from heat; and cities will bite hard.  For profits and profit-making can only be in the watery grave.  Climate change won´t fix the problem as long as hydrologists remain without a clear know-how of the problem until next summer. Climate change adds to
====================


[QUESTION]:What will be th economic effects of climate Change? 
[ANSWER]: Climate change impacts our economy because it changes how we work, impacts how we live and impacts how we keep our energy, food or medicine.

====================


[QUESTION]:What will be th economic effects of climate Change? 
[ANSWER]:Climate change will "reoccur over time": the effects of climate change will become more and more prevalent for people, ecosystems and economies in the form of major weather events, seasonal or episodic. For analogy, its understanding bipedal movement was one of these events.

====================


[QUESTION]:What will be th economic effects of climate Change? 
[ANSWER]:Climate change is a number of processes that cause uneven changes in soil and changed carbon management practices. If you are concerned with sustainability, it's relevant to apply this concept to sustainable practices, which is a science that can r

a good way to make habits.

====================


[QUESTION]:What will be th economic effects of climate Change? 
[ANSWER]:The proponents of climate change would like to propose that they reduce the cost of energy by stopping fossil fuels. They theoretically say that they boost the economy by closing off carbon emissions, covering the economic uncertainty it thrusts on (but they don't actually do it).
They fail to explain to the-
to people they're not directly interfering with the human economy. Many anti-conservatives don't realise how bad
coal/clean-energy policy is.
These programs don't target the environmental
====================


[QUESTION]:What will be th economic effects of climate Change? 
[ANSWER]:Surface warming of 1°C or more would have no environmental impact.

====================


[QUESTION]:What will be th economic effects of climate Change? 
[ANSWER]:These are the collective effects of global warming. Like climate change, any economic outcome depends largely on environmental effects. Policy makers also need to consider ecological impacts for managing climate change. Once climate change became vague, then understanding its effects became more difficult, explained By Bourguignon, because socially useful actions now make the land resources and communities more polluted. Should we do not act to also be sustainable, none of our practices or actions will be applicable to severe pollution problems

====================


[QUESTION]:What will be th economic effects of climate Change? 
[ANSWER]:Global warming presents an opportunity to decrease emissions of greenhouse gases, and also measures to reduce inhumane behavior and deforestation. The degree of this reduction depends on the pact with countries holding open their markets to polluters.
However, it will be hard to achieve if everyone of us continues to face negative social consequences from emissions. And, yes, the harm that climate change is already creating is very vulnerable to climate impact. But, these adverse social consequences should not be underused. Each decision over generations should

[QUESTION]:What is the advantage and disadvantage of renewable energy? 
[ANSWER]:Renewables rely on renewable sources of energy, specifically hydroelectric and solar power. They also include wind power, biomass, petrochemical agriculture, and plant based thermal energy to release heat from the ground to be used as a heat source. Renewables also include natural waste heat extracted from the drainage system. They utilize natural vegetation and earth with animal cycles.

====================


[QUESTION]:What is the advantage and disadvantage of renewable energy? 
[ANSWER]:The renewable energy paradigm gives us abundant and cheap resources there are life forms, including human beings. Most renewable energy is not considered to be important in its impact on the environment, but is important in its ability to meet our needs when using renewable fuels, which includes emissions of carbon dioxide.

This is one of the most important questions, because we understand that a lack of objective knowledge leads to profit
====================


[QUESTION]:What is the advantage and disadvantage of renewable energy? 
[ANSWER]:Renewal refers to the recycling of energy materials. Renewable energy technology aims at creating clean, reliable and carbon-free energy.
Renewing of energy resources is their purpose is to reduce or eliminate the risk of environmental troubles caused by active pollution. Usually we are advised to use products of which the used energy is not environmentally harmful. On the other hand, products of which the used energy is very harmful are not recommended to humanity due to the risk of reduced product quality.

[QUESTION]:What is the advantage and disadvantage of renewable energy? 
[ANSWER]:Renewables are renewable energy produced from it (useful in these greener places). They emit less energy than fossil fuels. They use less energy. They are less nourishing. They decrease the energy costs. They do not produce as much waste to produce as fossil fuels.
Renewables are better at distributing energy. They distribute energy more efficiently (e.g., according to duration and frequency, which means it is more expensive to produce more energy, but its benefits are used more often
====================


[QUESTION]:What is the advantage and disadvantage of renewable energy? 
[ANSWER]:Renewable energy is cost-savings in fossil fuel prices and use of fossil fuels and energy. Renewable energy energy markets are heavily influenced by cheap assets like solar, wind and hydro. This could increase affordability for fossil based electricity and biofuels.
Renewable energy base is electricity, but it also includes almost all energy utilities product for replacement energy demand and energy products such as cars, etc. plants produce fertilizer, plant biomass, biomass, digester gas, etc.

====================


[QUESTION]:What is the advantage and disadvantage of renewable energy? 
[ANSWER]: Renewable energy is energy that is made from unburnable fossil fuels. Renewable energy, even where it is produced, makes little use of its dependence on carbon by virtue of not powering transportation of raw materials. There is no concern about warming due to carbon taken out of air, for example, and therefore not climate change.
