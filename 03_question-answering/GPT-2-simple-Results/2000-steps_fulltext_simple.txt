[QUESTION]:What is the difference between climate change and global warming? 
[ANSWER]:Global warming refers to the long-term warming of the planet. Climate change encompasses global warming, but refers to the broader range of changes that are happening to our planet, including rising sea levels; shrinking mountain glaciers; accelerating ice melt in Greenland, Antarctica and the Arctic; and shifts in flower/plant blooming times.

[QUESTION]:What is the greenhouse effect? 
[ANSWER]:The greenhouse effect is the way in which heat is trapped close to the surface of the Earth by greenhouse gases.

[QUESTION]:How much does nuclear power affect world climate change? 
[ANSWER]:Nuclear power releases a lot of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, as most of the electricity we use comes from fossil-fuel-generated energy industry. Nuclear energy also releases large amounts of heat-trapping gas into the atmosphere, such as methane and carbon dioxide (CO2)

====================


[QUESTION]:How much does nuclear power affect world climate change? 
[ANSWER]:According to international agreements and frameworks, only 0.3% of the energy generated by the burning of fossil resources must come from nuclear energy.

====================


[QUESTION]:How much does nuclear power affect world climate change? 
[ANSWER]:Nuclear energy creates highly unstable combinations of atmospheric greenhouse gases which can react unpredictably with no way of predicting their behaviour.

[QUESTION]:What will be the economic effects of climate Change? 
[ANSWER]:The effects will be felt in different quantitatively, but most people do not realize that climate change affects every field of human activity, including business. Climate
change induces economic regression and economic stagnation. When given time enough climate change will drive
up energy, food costs, energy, transportation and heating costs, labor costs, and pollution and reduce people’s health.
====================


[QUESTION]:What will be the economic effects of climate Change? 
[ANSWER]:Domestically, companies and other industries will be the biggest energy consumers negatively affected. Particularly, energy related productivity will suffer due to increased demand for power and
coolant (energy storage technologies) solutions.

[QUOTE:]Death to stupidity!

Truly climate change will be a problem for the developing world and most of the industrialised countries especially emerging
countries. However, the solutions to climate change will not come from a monetary nor bureaucratic sphere but from the main
energy
====================


[QUESTION]:What will be the economic effects of climate Change? 
[ANSWER]:At present, the economic losses caused by climate change are not very high, but if we use the available
human resources, we can create new jobs in the renewable energy sector and solve some
of our biggest poverty problems.

[QUESTION]:What is the advantage and disadvantage of renewable energy? 
[ANSWER]:There is a huge opportunity for creating jobs and prosperity, as well as providing the environment with what it needs to survive.

Globalization is changing how people think and feel. Here are some words and phrases that people used in 288 different languages in 16 countries in West
Asia: Spanish, French, German, Chinese, Japanese, Tibetan and Tamil.
The internet opens up all countries to new opportunities and risks. There is hesitation in some of the responses
====================


[QUESTION]:What is the advantage and disadvantage of renewable energy? 
[ANSWER]:The advantage is that it can be installed relatively inexpensively (compared with fossil fuels), -energy density, heat transfer, floating around the planet, and clean. The disadvantage is that it has few guarantees regarding the longevity of the networks (which is difficult in a climatic crisis), and has to be constantly switched on.

[BABYMETAL]: Although not technically classified as a genre in the popular genre literature, several theories describe the sound chronology of
its development, the nature
====================


[QUESTION]:What is the advantage and disadvantage of renewable energy? 
[ANSWER]:The advantage of renewable energy is that it is cheap, easy to install, can still provide a small amount of energy in remote locations; the disadvantage is that it is highly vulnerable to weather and fluctuations in the atmosphere. The atmospheric movements

programmes installed in all energy-producing machines that use fossil fuels.

[QUESTION]: How much does global warming affect wildlife tourism? 
[ANSWER]:Climate change can have a negative impact on tourism. Tourism should be able to adapt to some of these changes by choosing areas where the climate is mild enough to allow for tourism; by choosing tourist destinations where there are few or no negative effects on tourism; by choosing places that have low impact on tourism values
or by investing in coastal protection and coastal regeneration
and adaptation

====================


[QUESTION]: How much does global warming affect wildlife tourism? 
[ANSWER]: Global warming negatively affects the numbers of species of bird, turtle and amphibians that are present on our planet, and could even lead to extinction of some of these species.

====================


[QUESTION]: How much does global warming affect wildlife tourism? 
[ANSWER]: Climate change and tourism are two very different things, but climate change is more than just bad for tourism. Climate change can cause significant declines in the abundance of natural habitats, disrupt migration patterns of some species, lead to new epidemics (the West Nile virus, Ebola and yellow fever). Tourism, on the other hand, can be very good for a lot of species of migratory birds, butterflies, moths, and other species. Vulnerable species like the mink, dove and desert swallow are

[QUESTION]: What is the impact from sea level rise on tourism? 
[ANSWER]: Sea level rise is a phenomenon which, as a result of climate change, raises the risk of erosion of coastal cities. In
this sense, there is increased pressure on the local authorities to reduce the risk of coastal erosion in order to avoid more floods, while the
national framework recommends strengthening the local resilience to flood risk.

====================


[QUESTION]: What is the impact from sea level rise on tourism? 
[ANSWER]:Sea level rise is generally understood to refer to a rise in sea levels. Tourism, as an economic asset, may also be affected. The costs related to this increase may be high, making tourism ­ particularly vulnerable”.

====================


[QUESTION]: What is the impact from sea level rise on tourism? 
[ANSWER]:The factors that contribute to sea level rise (i.e. land subsidence) are mostly caused by migrations of people, industrial pollution, and natural disasters.

[QUESTION]: How important is green economy for mitigating global warming? 
[ANSWER]: The green economy refers to areas specifically dedicated to the development of green jobs and the livelihoods of the people.

[QUESTION]: How would a carbon tax help? 
[ANSWER]: Carbon taxes modify the pricing of goods and services on the exchanges. They are therefore needed most urgently in
curbing global warming.

====================


[QUESTION]: How important is green economy for mitigating global warming? 
[ANSWER]:It is important to adopt green economy policies because it contributes to addressing climate change and serves as a model for future policies.

====================


[QUESTION]: How important is green economy for mitigating global warming? 
[ANSWER]: Green economy refers to infrastructure and policies which nurture, transform and release economic development in the
direction of reducing energy use. So called ‘green economy’ is developed when the economy is transformed in
the same manner as existing infrastructure, allows potential benefits to flow by reducing energy use, and results in
benefits that will trickle-down to the society.
