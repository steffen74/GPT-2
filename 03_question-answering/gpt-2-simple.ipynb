The two reports reveal a common picture regarding the development of the Internet-based infrastructure of the world through economic growth and productivity. Both reports indicate that the global Internet growth has significantly strengthened cooperation and economic development since its beginning in 2006. This trend is the subject of a growing body of literature, mainly in the context of the ongoing debates and debates. Such literature focuses on the reasons for the recent growth of the Internet. The first such literature concerns the economic benefits associated with the Internet growth in 2012. The second concerns the current state of the Internet and the future prospects for its use. A recent research paper, entitled\n","\n","The Internet and Growth in 2012\n","\n","is an important contribution towards the study and discussion about the Internet and other economic activities. According to this paper, the economic benefits associated with the Internet growth in 2012 have been more pronounced than in other years. The paper presents a multi–year and multi–country estimate of economic growth across countries for 2012. In this review of the first volume of the study, a detailed analysis of the data and methods of the initial study is presented.\n","This research paper will therefore first discuss the main areas from which the analysis is derived.

The main objective of this analysis was to identify which countries that show substantial improvement in Internet growth over the years with respect to GDP-per capita growth. To determine which countries showed the strongest positive trends on the basis of their economic growth, the two papers were conducted together, and one paper was conducted within the other. The two papers were conducted in 2013 with different data and different methods.\n","The main results from the preliminary studies are presented in .\n","The first paper (Cantu, 2014) investigated the country-level growth of Internet penetration over the 16-year period 1996-2011 and finds the strongest positive trend of growth of Internet penetration over this period among the five Baltic states: Belarus, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland. The Baltic states show a strong positive trend of Internet penetration over this period, but it is not significantly stronger in Lithuania (10.7%), Estonia (10.2%), Latvia (10.6%) or Poland (10.6%) than in 1999-2011 (9.3%).\n","The second paper (Cantu, 2014) considered the economic growth in 2012 over the 16-year period, and found a strong positive trend with respect to GDP per capita growth in Poland (6.0%), Estonia (6.0%), Latvia (6.0%), Lithuania (6.0%) and Belarus (6.0%) which are the 5 Baltic states with the highest Internet penetration over the 16-year observation period.\n","\n","3. The authors' conclusions regarding the study\n","\n","The authors have concluded that the Internet has provided strong opportunities for growth. Moreover, the current economic growth is linked to a rapid and sustainable increase in the number of broadband connections at the national level (the Internet penetration rate – in 2013), which is expected to further increase between 2013 and the end of 2015. The authors conclude that the increase in Internet penetration may facilitate economic growth as well as increase the number of connections.\n","\n","This study does not provide strong evidence regarding economic growth for the period 2012–2015, but it does suggest that the future trends in Internet and related economic activities are likely to be positive for the Baltic-speaking nations. There seems to be an increasing tendency for Russia to see emerging economic and political developments in countries such as Poland and Lithuania.\n","The authors' findings are consistent with previous studies which have concluded that internet penetration has supported Russian growth. In fact, the authors of this paper, and others, have concluded in other studies that Internet penetration is seen as a major threat to Russia's economic growth.

From an economic perspective,\n","this development must take place as a result of economic, technical and\n","cultural development: the creation of good-paying jobs in order\n","to attract investment, increase industrial efficiency and reduce\n","the distortion of public services.

This type of research, however,\n","does not fully capture the complexity and the scope of the global\n","complexity.\n","While many authors and economists admit that they cannot\n","make global policy determinants when analysing the state of\n","the development system, they can use the interconnection between the economic, social\n","and environment dynamics to make a more accurate\n","evaluation. It is a very different view from the one for international\n","governance which is more focused on the domestic political\n","and economic situation, a very familiar case study for the IMF.\n","We can identify many commonalities in the views, but also\n","differences.
