            " the South East of the U.K. in the late 1820s. Between the end of the 19th and end of the 20th century, the new industrial revolution was the dominant factor, with the addition of several new towns – Brighton, Bristol, Leeds, and Manchester- the latter of which had attracted a number of new manufacturing centres, including the first plant to use the new machine-working method. Around the time of World War I the economic importance of the Manchester Machine Works (MMS) company was increased by the expansion in Manchester, and the city was referred to the City Council on several occasions. The city was also called the home of the Great Northern Railway and its line between Liverpool. A number of the companies started and operated in the Manchester area for the British Government, with the Manchester Automobile Works (MADWP), Manchester Rail Works (MGWR), and Manchester Steel Works (SMWS) companies being known as the Manchester Manufacturing Works, Manchester Diesel Works (MWW), the Manchester Rail Works (MGRW), and the Manchester Industrial Machine Works (MIMW). By the late 1920s the Manchester Machine Works became the most established manufacturer – providing about 200,000 jobs in the Midlands and the region, while the rest of the city saw a small amount of employment. The company is still a relatively small group, numbering around one thousand employees, with a turnover of about 60,000. It produces machinery, electrical components, and electrical cables in the Midlands region, the world's largest supplier of equipment to electric utilities and other industrial customers. A joint venture with T-Grafts was set up in 1940, with MGS also working on a joint venture with T-Grafts until the early 1950s. The company is a well-known name among the general public in Manchester, the capital city of the United Kingdom, and a major target for international competitors. MMS has been recognised by the City Council as an excellent and sustainable employer of manpower which works in conjunction with social enterprise groups.\n",

            "Manchester was home to a large group of manufacturing plants from the 1870s until the beginning of the 20th century. Under industrialism, the city's main industries, including steel manufacturing, cotton manufacturing, and agricultural products were all in service to the broader British economy. Manchester also had a large part of the economy devoted to manufacturing, a significant shift of some 70,000 persons to manufacturing production – over 70% of its total employment. MBS was the largest maker of steel, having been founded by William Lloyd George in 1835. By the early 19th century, this industry was increasingly dominated by Manchester-based firms. In the 19th century the firm was controlled by the Manchester Automobile Works, whose headquarters were built on the old site of the Manchester Automobile Works. The MMS manufacturing firm built three factories in the city, one on the site of the defunct Manchester Motor Works. With manufacturing becoming a key sector within the city's economy, the MMS continued this trend. By the late 1890s, MBS's factories were producing hundreds of thousands of units of goods for manufacturers all over the city. By the end of the century MBS's factories were producing about 700,000 units of goods per month. By the late 1920s, MBS was the largest manufacturer of steel. By the end of World War I, MBS's output was approximately 10,000 units per month.\n",

            "In the late nineteenth century, Sheffield was the largest industrial city in the UK. The largest employer was William Lloyd George of Sheffield, with about 2,000 workers. The first factory of William Lloyd George's was opened in 1837 by the Sheffield Automobile Works, then owned by Thomas Lloyd George. This factory had a significant part of the city's industrial workers in service to William Lloyd George, the family. In the early decades of the 20th century, industrialisation took place in and around Sheffield. Under Industrial Law (1815), which gave employers the right to buy machines, tools and machinery, the works had to be built with the minimum of human labour. Work on the industrial sector had begun, as industrialisation was being made for the first time in Britain. The first manufacturing plant of the company, a partnership with Thomas Lloyd George, was built in 1858. It became one of the largest manufacturer of machinery, equipment and supplies with a factory of about 12,000 workers. Sheffield remained an important location for manufacturing for the family, manufacturing companies, and other companies. By 1900, it had about 200,000 employees, the largest employed workforce of any industrial and manufacturing city in Britain. By 1910, there were four factories of the family, owned by the London Automobile Works and one jointly run by two businesses. The family owned two separate companies- a large business in Sheffield and a commercial firm in Sheffield. The business group consisted of large British firms, including Ford, Balfour Beatty, Henry Ford, Ford Motor, R.D. Laing, and Henry Ford Co.\n",

In 2009, more than 10 million people in Chile had no access to a government to exercise their right to self-determination and to vote for who they elected to fill those seats. The situation has become worse in the past few years with many of these elections being rigged to favor the party with the largest number of votes. The lack of voter participation also negatively impacts the democratic legitimacy of the new government. The opposition has a greater ability to form a coalition under the constitution to change laws but it lacks the support of the state to do so and it is also difficult for individuals to influence legislation from the electoral process. The most notable recent example being in May 2009, the national referendum on the constitution was called in favor of an alternative legal structure.

Smokers have more than 50 million years of experience, and the number one cause of nonsmokers' death was lung cancer. The U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has established a smoking-death reduction goal, although this goal is only based on an attempt to prevent deaths by preventable causes. The goal is to eliminate deaths in the U.S. by 2020 from nonsmokers by reducing exposure to indoor air pollution.

A few exceptions have been found, such as the definition of \"smoker\" by the California Department of Health Services, which refers to people who \"have smoked more than twice a month since the age of 17, or a person who has ever smoked on more than 14 days of the week, or who previously had a habit.\" Other examples used in the media that do not include the word smoking include the words \"motorcyclist\", \"motorcyclist friend\", and the term \"motorcyclist with a motorcycle\". The word \"motorcyclist\" is commonly used to mean a motorist who speeds up in a motorcycle while others are sitting still, the term being derived from the letters a, w, l, m, o.

When someone lights a cigarette, the smoke exhaled can be seen for many hours. If someone smokes a couple of cigarette aftershaves, only the second or third one may be visible on a person's face. If a person chooses to wash the mouth area of a cigarette, a small piece of hair is visible. Smoking cessation can be an important goal of some groups, which is why smoking cessation information campaigns can be so effective. However, it is not universal to all smokers, and a person's physical or mental health may be affected by factors such as family history of diseases, physical appearance, smoking habits, diet, physical activity, sleep habits, or other environmental exposures.\n",

A combination oral and intramuscular delivery of nicotine for purposes of smoking cessation is currently used in the treatment of nicotine addiction in the US. Nicotine is also present in many other human foods, for example sugar, starch, soy, egg, rice, peanuts, beans, guar, pork, lobster, chicken and guacamole. Nicotine is also present in some prescription pain medication as well as in some topical anti-clotting agents such as lidocaine and siclopirox. Nicotine is also present in cigarette smoke after first lighting due to the low vapor output of cigarettes; it is also present in the exhaust of cigarette cigarettes. Nicotine appears to have been incorporated into the smoking habit as a natural by-product of the cigarette industry in spite of the fact that nicotine is poisonous, carcinogenic, mutagenic, and neurotoxic.[citation needed] While nicotine is not toxic, it can cause respiratory irritation and irritation of the throat, especially in those who take aspirin. Nicotine exposure may therefore adversely affect the nasal mucus membranes and the integrity of the nasal cavity. However, no evidence indicates that the smoking cessation benefits of nicotine outweigh its health risks.[citation needed]\n",

An empire that is dependent on air support to get a foothold in its oceans and in its harbours can be severely weakened during a conflict, especially when the opponent has air superiority. Moreover, an air force can only operate in conditions when it is capable of sustaining air attack from sea or from air-land. With a narrow and vulnerable sea access, and heavy reliance on air support, air power may not work and air-land power may not hold its own in a conflict unless the fleet or other vessels can reach those air bases in sufficient detail. Another significant advantage of having sea or air cover over land is that air bases from an altitude of only a few hundred meters or more do not exist until the sea is no longer open and air supply has become possible.\n",
