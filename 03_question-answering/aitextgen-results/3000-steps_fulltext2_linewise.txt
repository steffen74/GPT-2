Prompt:

[QUESTION]:What is the difference between climate change and global warming? 
[ANSWER]:Global warming refers to the long-term warming of the planet. Climate change encompasses global warming, but refers to the broader range of changes that are happening to our planet, including rising sea levels; shrinking mountain glaciers; accelerating ice melt in Greenland, Antarctica and the Arctic; and shifts in flower/plant blooming times.

[QUESTION]:What is the greenhouse effect? 
[ANSWER]:The greenhouse effect is the way in which heat is trapped close to the surface of the Earth by greenhouse gases.

[QUESTION]:How much does coal power affect world climate change?
[ANSWER]:
==========

Coal-based power generation is fueled by fossil fossil energy technologies and is polluting. Coal-fired power generation is the most polluting option in the world. Coal power generation generates about 1.5 times more greenhouse gas than coal-fired generation. Coal power generation is then used in the form of coal-fired power plants, coal-fired power plants have a marginal contribution to the emissions, and coal-fired generation is an alternative to coal-fired generation. Coal-fired power generation in the USA has been for decades the most polluting fossil

Coal power has a direct and indirect effect on climate change. Coal poweran be a major source of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. It also generates greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, which makes it a greenhouse gas. Coal power is also a key element for the global temperature change, because it has airect effect on greenhouse gas concentrations. Coal power has a direct and indirect effect on climate change. Coal power has airect and indirect effect on climate change. Coal power is also important for the global energy security because it provides backup power for the electricity generationh
==========
Coal power has a relatively modest contribution to reducing global temperature. Coal power is coal power generation. However, according to recent data, the coal power capacity is less than half that of coal power. Coal power is the largestource of greenhouse gas emissions in the world, accounting for 80% of global warming.]


[ANSWER]: Coal power has a relatively low contribution to reducing world warming, accounting for 60% of global warming. Coal power is the largest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the world, accounting for 80% of global warming.
==========
Coal power is a major contributor to climate change. Coal power has more carbon dioxide than gasoline power. Coal power has higherhan gasoline power. Coal power makes renewable electricity cheaper and less energy expensive. Coal power has a direct effect on energy consumption. Coal power has a negative impact on the climate. Coal power has a negative impact on the energy prices. The reason is that coal power is cheaper than gasoline power. Coal power has lower energy consumption than gasoline power. Coal power has a positive effect on the energy costs. Coal power has a positive effect on

Coal power has historically been one of the most polluting fuels in the world, and it is the cheapest and the cheapest in the world. In fact, coal power haseen the most polluting natural resource in the world for more than half a century. Coal power has historically been the second most polluting fossiluil power in the world.coal power has historically been the most polluting fossil resource in the world. Coal power is the third most polluting fossil resource in the world. The third most polluting fossil resource in the world is fossil

Coal power is the most important form of energy supply for any economy on the planet; coal power is the most important form of energy supply for any economy on the planet; coal power is the cheapest and cheapest form of energy for anyountry on the planet. Coal power is also the cheapest and the cheapest form of energy for anyountry on the planet. Coal power sources the highest levels of greenhouse gases in the world. Coal power is the cheapest and the cheapest form of energy supply for anyountry on the planet. Coal power is the cheapest
==========
The climate change consequences are different for coal power plants. Coal power plants absorb some of the warming of greenhouse gases released by fossilic gases. Coal power plants absorb more than one part of the greenhouse gas released by fossil-fired power plants. The carbon-footprint effect is also the main driver of the greenhouse effect. Coal power plants absorb morehan one part of the greenhouse gases released by fossil-fired power plants.he greenhouse effect is the way in which greenhouse gases are released by fossil-fired power plants.

==========
Coal power is an important fossil energy source because it increases the energy consumption in the world. Coal power can also affect the climate change. Coal power is a fossil fuel because it is much cheaper and produces much less heat than coal power. Coal power has the highest carbon footprint inhe world (coal power has more carbon per unit of energy than coal power), but it is much cleaner than coal power. Coal power is also the cheapest energy because it can be produced in more energy efficient areas and is much more renewable. The carbon footprint is the key to
